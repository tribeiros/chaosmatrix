To all:

Here, as promised, is my transcription of the "Daughter of Fortitude"
speech from the Cotton Appendix. There is at least one significant
difference here from Casaubon's transcription. I cannot guarantee that I
have made no transcription errors, but in the case of replacing the word
"stone" with "sonne", I am in no doubt.

I have not included Dee's marginal notes here, as they are essentially the
same as appears in Casaubon, and are not essential to the text in this
instance.

Hoping that this is of some interest to you.

Clay

Transcribed from Cotton Appendix XLVI, Division XII,
"Actio Tertio Trebonae Generalis", ff. 218-220
-----------------------------------------------------------

I am the dowghter of fortitude, & ravyshed every howr, from

my youth, for behold, I am understanding, &

science dwelleth in me : & the hevens oppress me,

They covet and desyre me with infinite appetite

few or none that are erthly have embraced me

for I am shadowed with the circle of the sonne : and covered with

the morning clouds: My feet are swifter than the wynds,

& my hands are sweter than the morning dew.  My garments

are from the beginning: & my dwelling place is in my

self. The lyon knoweth not where I walk : neyther

do the bestes of the field understand me. I am deflowered &amp;

yet a virgin. I sanctifie & am not sanctified

happy is he that embraceth me. for in the night season

I am sweete, in the day full of pleasure

[end folio 218 / begin folio 219]

my company is a harmony of many Cymballs

And my lips sweeter than helth it self. I am a harlot

for such as ravish me : and a virgin with such as know

me not : for lo I am loved of many : & I am a

lover to many: and as many as come unto me as they should

do, have theyr enterteynment.  Purge your streets o

you sons of men, & wash your howses clean

Make your selves holy, & put on righteousness

Cast out your old strumpets, & burn theyr cloathes

Absteyn from the company of other women that are

defyled, that are sluttish, & not so handsome, &

bewtiful as I. And then will I come & dwell

amongst you. And behold I will bring furth

Children unto you: & they shall be the sons of comfort

I will open my garments, & stand naked before you

that your love may be more enflamed toward me.

As yet, I walk in the clowdes, As yet, I am carryed with

the wyndes : And can not descend unto you for the multitude

of your abbominations, & the filthy lothesomnes of your dwelling

places.  Behold these fowre, who is he, that
         -----------------------------------
shall say, they have synned : or unto whom shall
------------------------------------------------
they make accownt? Not unto you, =F4 you sons
-------------------------------------------
of men, nor unto your children : for unto the lord
--------------------------------------------------
belongeth the Judgment of his servants
--------------------------------------
Now therfor, let the erth give furth her fruits unto

you : And let the mowntayns forsake theyr barrenness

wher your fotestepps shall remayne. happy is he that

saluteth you : & cursed is he that holdeth up his

hands against you. & power shall be given unto
                     -------------------------
you from hence furth to resyst your enemies : & the

lord shall allways here you in the tymes of your

trubbles. And I am sent unto you to play
--------           ----
the harlot with you : And am to enrich you with the

spoyles of other men : prepare for me, for I comme

shortly. Provyde your Chambers for me that they

may be swete & clenly : for I will make a

dwelling place amongst you : and I will be

common with the father & the sonne, yea and with

all them that truely favoreth you

[end folio 219 / begin folio 220]

for my youth, is in her flowre and my strength is not

to be extinguished with man. Strong am I above &

below. Therefor, provyde for me. for behold I now

salute you. And let peace be amongst you : for I

am the Dowghter of Cumfort. Disclose not
       ---------------------------------
my secrets unto women : nether let them understand
-----------------------
how swete I am. for all things belongeth not unto

every one

I comme unto you again.
