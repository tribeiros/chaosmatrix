Forward

   In this issue of the Thelema Lodge Calendar we begin a transcription of
John Dee's spiritual diaries.  Our serialization begins with Elias Ashmole's
preface to "Doctor Dee's Five Books of Mystery (Doctoris Dee Mysteriorum
Libri Quinti),"  comparing the texts of Slane Manuscripts 3188 and 3677.
Though this particular passage is already avaiable in several modern editions,
we include it here as a general introduction, and in order to preserve the
continuity of our project.
   In preparing this text we have expanded most abbreviations, noting the
first instance of each (notes in printed TLC only).  Spelling, capitalization,
and punctuation have been left intact.  References to manuscripts in the
Sloane collection are designated "SL," with all textual variations noted (only
in the printed TLC, not in this electronic edition).  Ashmole's annotation is
given (in the printed TLC edition only) in the left hand column, with our
commentary (printed TLC only) upon his notes following.  Our own editorial
annotation is placed opposite, on the right hand, and standard abbreviation
has been used (in the printed TLC edition only). Textual variations are noted
all together, following the text (in the printed TLC edition).
   It is our intention over the course of time to provide a completely
standardized edition of the magical manuscripts of John De, that serious
practitioners and interested students of Enochian Magick may have a reliable
guide in their work.

-------- Here is Ashmole's text:

   Be it remembered, That the 20th: of August 1672.  I received by the hands
of my Servant Samuell Story, a parcell of Doctor Dee's Manuscripts, all
written with his owne hand;  vizt:  his Conference with Angells, which first
began the 22d: of December anno 1581.  And continued to the end of May anno
1583, where the printed Booke of theremaining Conferences (published by
Doctor Cawsabon) begins, and are bound up in this Volume.
   Beside these, the Booke intituled, the 48 Claves Angelicae, also Liber
Scientia Terrestris -- Auxilij et Victoria (These two being those very
individuall Bookes, which the Angells commanded to be burnt, and were after
restored by them as appeares by the printedRelation of Doctor Dee's Actions
with Spirits pages 418. & 419.)  The Booke intituled De Heptarchia Mystica --
Collectaneorum Liber primus, and a Booke of Invocations or Calls, beginning
with the Squares filled with Letters, about the Black Cross.  These foure
Bookes I have bound up in another volume.
   All which, were a few daies before delivered to my said Servant, for my
perusall (I being then at Mr: William Lillies house at Hersham in Surrey)
by my good friend Mr: Thomas Wale, one of him Majesties Warders in the Tower
of London.
   The 5th: of September following Mr: Wale (having heard of my retourne to
Towne) came to my Office in the Excise Office in Broadstreete, and told me
he was content to exchange all the aforesaid Books, for one of myne, vizt:
The Institution Lawes & Ceremonies of the most Noble Order of the Garter,
to this I agreed, and provided one, which I sent him fairely bound, and
gilt on the Back.
   On the 10th: of the said September Mr: Wale came thither to me againe,
and brought his wife with him, from her I received the following account of
the preservation of these Bookes, even till they came to my hands, vzit:
That her former Husband was one Mr: Jones a Confectioner, who formerly
Dwelt at the Plow in Lumbardstreet London, and who, shortly after they were
married, tooke her with him into Adle Streete among the Joyners, to buy soem
Houshold stuff, where (at the Corner house) they saw a Chest of Cedar wood
about a yard and an halfe long, whose Lock and Hinges, being of extraordinary
neate worke, invited them to buy it.  The Master of the shop told them it had
been parcell of the Goods of one Mr: John Woodall Chirurgeon (father to Mr:
Thomas Woodall late Serjant Chirurgeon to his now Majestie King Charles the
Second (my intimate friend) and tis very probable he bought it after Doctor
Dee's death, when his goods were exposed to Sales.
   Twenty yeares after this (and about 4 yeares before the fatall Fire of
London) she and her good husband occasionally removing this Chest out of its
usuall place, thought they heard some loose thing ratle in it, toward the
right hand end, under the Box or Till thereof, and by shaking it, were
fully satisfied it was so:  Hereupon her Husband thrust a peece of Iron into
a small Crevice at the bottome of the Chest, and thereupon appeared a private
drawer, which being drawne out, therein were found divers Bookes in
Manuscrpt, and Papers, together with a litle Box, and therein a Chaplet of
Olive Beades, and a Cross of the same wood, hanging at the end of them.
   Them made no great matter of these Bookes, etc. because they understood
them not; which occasioned their Servant Maide to wast about one halfe of
them under Pyes, and other like uses, which when discovered, they kept the
rest more safe.
   About two yeares after the discovery of these Bookes, Mr. Jones died; and
when the fire of London hapned, thought the Chest perished in the Flames,
because not easily to be removed, yet the Bookes were taken out and carried
with the rest of Mrs: Jones her goods into Moorefields, and being brought
safely back, she took care to preserve them; and after marrying with the
aforesaid Mr: Wale, he came to the knowledge of them, and there upon, with her
concent, sent them to me, as I have before set downe.

John Dee his Note.

ANNAEL  --- The Angel, or Intelligence, that now predominates the whole world.

---Etymology:  The Grace of God.  The Affliction of God.  The Compassionate.

Michael    Gabriel    Raphael    Uriel

---The Four Angelic governors of the Cardinal points of Heaven:  as Agrippa
notes in his scale of four.

ANA and ANaH.

It is our particular request that through our solemn appealing and confessing
we may see a serious sign, of the speech and manifestation of God.

Explicatio.

   The preceeding andelic arrangement is a synthesis of
Renaissance metaphysical principles;  in particular combining
the occult doctrines of H. Cronelius Agrippa with John Dee's
own rather peculiar magical theorems.  The four archangels
central to this table are the angelic personalities whose
proper names appear in the Cannon and Apocrypha of traditional
Hebrew and Christian scripture.  It was the primary intention
of Dee's religious magick, as will become clear in the exegesis
of his spiritual diaries, to make contact with these angelic
intelligences.
   It is the placement of Annael in the superior position of
this hierarchy that is rather unorthodox.  It is probable the
Dee is identifying this particular angel with the Anima Mundi,
or World Spirit, as predominating over the rulers of the four
elements.  This representation of the feminine aspect of
nature, and the female spirit in particular, can be seen in
the concluding plate of the first edition of Dee's "Monas
Heiroglyphica," where she is pictured grasping in her right
hand a seven-pointed star.  This heptangular symbol is
cabalistically attributed to Netzach, whose ruling archangel
is Haniel, an alternate form of the name Annael.  Studious
attention to the phonetic exposition of his concluding note,
as well as to the etymological and hieratical implications of the
upper right-hand notation, will support this proposition.
The concluding note is itself both an attempt to translate
and to latinize the given Hebrew idiom, and in so doing to set
forth the formative method of Dee's Magical experiments in the
science of theurgy.

             John Dee's Daily Oration for Wisdom

            from "The First Book of the Mysteries"


Praeter alias meas extemporaneas preces, et eiaculationes ad Deum
  vehementiores: Haec una, maxime usitata fuit.

            Oratio mea Matutina, Vespertinaque: pro Sapientia.

        In nomine Dei Patris, Dei Filij, Dei Spiritus Sancti Amen.

 Omnipotens, Sempiterne, Vere, et Vive Deus, in adiutorium meum intende:
  Domine Dominantium, Rex Regum, Jeovah Zebaoth ad adiuvandum me festina:

Gloria Deo, Patri, Filio, et spiritui Sancto: Sicut erat in principio, et
             nunc, et semper: et in saecula Saeculorum: Amen.

Recte sapere, et intelligere doceto me, (o rerum omnium Creator,) Nam
  Sapientia tua, totum est, quod volo: Da verbum tuum in ore meo, ( rerum
  omnium Creator,) et Sapientiam tuam in corde meo fige.

O Domine Jesu Christe (qui sapientia vera es, aeterni et, Omnipotentis tui
  Patris) humilime tuam oro Divinam Maiestatem, expeditum mihi ut mittere
  digneris, alicuius pij, Sapientis expertique Philosophi auxilium, ad illa
  plenissime intelligenda perficiendaque, quae maximi valoris erunt ad tuam
  laudem et gloriam amplificandam: Et si Mortalis nullus iam in terris
  Vivat, qui ad hoc munus aptus sit: Vel qui ex aeterna tua  providentia,
  ad istud mihi praestandum beneficium assignatus fuerit: Tunc equidem
  humilime, ardentissime et constantissime a tua Divina Maiestate requiro,
  Ut ad me de caelis mittere digneris bonos tuos Spirituales Ministros,
  Angelosque, Videlicet Michaelem, Gabrielem, Raphaelem ac Urielem: et (ex
  Divino tuo favore) quotienscunque alios, veros, fidelesque tuos Angelos,
  qui me plene et prefecte informent et instruant, in cognitione,
  intelligentiaque vera et exacta, Arcanorum et Magnalium tuorum (Creaturas
  omnes tuas, illarumque naturas, proprietates, et optimos usus,
  concernentium) et nobis Mortalibus scitu necessariorum; ad tui nominis
  laudem, honorem, et gloriam; et ad solidam meam, aliorumque (per me,)
  plurimorum tuorum fidelium consolationem: et ad Inimicorum tuorum
  confusionem, et subversionem.
                                   Amen.
Fiat Jeovah Zebaoth: Fiat Adonay, fiat Elohim.  O beata, et superbenedicta
  Omnipotens Trinitas, Concedas mihi (Joanni Dee) petitionem hanc, modo
  tali, qui tibi maxime placebit.
                                   Amen.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

                 Ab anno 1579. hoc fere modo:
Latine vel Anglice; (ast circa annum 1569 alio et peculiari, particulari
  modo:  interdum pro Raphaele: interdum pro Michaele) ad Deum preces
  fundere:  mihi gratissimum fuit: Mirabilem in me faciat Deus
  Misericordiam suum.  Amen.

                     --Translation--

  Before my other extemporaneous prayers and more ardent ejaculations to
God: This one was the most usual.

  My Morning and Evening Oration: for Wisdom.

  In the Name of God the Father, of God the Son, and of God the Holy
Spirit.  Amen.

  Almighty, Everlasting, True and Living God stretch forth, now, to my
help:
  Lord of Lords, King of Kings, Jehovah Lord of Hosts, hasten to my
assistance.

  Glory to God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: As it was in the beginning,
and is now, and will be always, even unto the Age of Ages:  Amen.

  Teach me to properly sense, and to rightly discern, (O Father of all
things,) For I desire your Wisdom, because it is all that is: Give your
word to my established practice,(O Father of all things,) and fix your
wisdom in my heart.

O Lard Jesus Christ (who art the true wisdom, of your eternal, and
Omnipotent Father) Most humbly I entreat your Divine Majesty, that you
might think myself worthy, in respect of my general piety, to promptly send
forth your Wise and tested Philosophical assistance, to that fulfillment of
understanding and perfection, that will be of the greatest value towards
the enlarging of my praising and glorification to you.  And when no one is
subject to Death, and at last there is Life in the Earth, to which office
is it that I will have been fitted: In particular to whom, according to
your eternal foresight, will your beneficent eminence have assigned me:
Moreover, truly and most humbly it is my most burning and most steadfast
quest to your Divine Majesty, that you would think worthy to send forth
from heaven to me, your good Spiritual Ministers and Angels, Namely
Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and even Uriel: and (in accordance with your
Heavenly favor ) as often so ever as any other of your true and faithful
Angels, who might completely and perfectly inform and furnish me, in the
true and accurate, knowledge and understanding of your Secret Mysteries and
Mighty Works (Concerning the properties of all of your Creatures and the
best use of those natures) and of the unavoidable necessity for the Decree
of our Deaths; to the praising, honoring, and glorification of your name;
and to confirm to me, and of others (through me) of your many faithful
encouragements: and to the disorder and ruin of your enemies.  Amen.

    Let the Will of Jehovah Zebaoth be done: Let the Will of Adonai be
done, let the will of Elohim be done, O Blessed and Most Beneficent
Almighty Trinity, yield to me (John Dee) this request, for such a method,
whereby to most appease you.  Amen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Since the year 1579. in general by this mode;
   It has been most pleasing to me to pour forth prayers to God; Either in
the Latin language or in the English (moreover since around the year 1579
by a particularly strange and different method: sometimes for Raphael;
occasionally for Michael) Let God, his own mercy, be glorious in me. Amen.

                  APOLOGIA ET POSTSCRIPTUM

     This month we have presented Dr. John Dee's introductory Latin prayer
from Mysteriorum Liber Primus.  It is notable that most medieval and
Renaissance magical texts were prefaced with Christian supplications of this
type, designed frequently to circumvent the enthusiasms of zealous
inquisitors.  Conjurers of every shade of gray veiled their evocative formulae
under pages of righteous theological pretension.  And more often than not it
was the darkest demonologists who penned the purest prefatory prose.
     It is quite possible, given the facts of John Dee's life amidst the
contemporary religious and political institutions, that his motivation was
in part to dissemble, with the introductory material here presented,  the
occult activities of his magical practice.  It is also quite certain that
these same phrases embody to a considerable extent Dee's sincere beliefs
and intentions.  Careful study of his introduction will reveal a great deal
about the foundation and direction of the science of Enochian Magick.
      In presenting this passage of Latin text, we have relied on Dee's own
manuscript version (Sloane MSS. 3188), with aid of Ashmole's later
transcript (Sloane MSS. 3677).  Our translation of the text attempts to
convey Dee's own sense and style, and it is our sincere desire to attract
the attention of classical scholars more learned than ourselves for the
correction of this version in future editions.

     As always, a reproduction of the manuscripts and other materials used
in the preparation of our text can be easily had from the CENTER FOR
ENOCHIAN STUDIES for a supporting donation of $3.00 (please make checks
payable to CASH, and request vol. I # 3).

 John Dee's Introductory Prayer to His First Angelic Communication.

               Ad Deum Omnipotentem Protestatio fidelis: 
                ad perpetuam rei memoriam Anno 1582.   

            A Testimony to the faithful Omnipotence of God:     
            as a continual memorial concerning the matters    
                       of the year 1582.

     O God Almighty, thou knowest, and art my director, and witness herein, That I have from youth up, desired and prayed unto thee for pure and sound wisdom and understanding of some of thy truths natural and artificial: such as by which thy wisdom, and goodness, and power bestowed in the frame of the world might be brought, in some bountiful measure under the talent of my capacity, to thy honor and glory, the benefit of thy servants, my brethren and sistern in and by thy Christ our Saviour.
     And for as much as many as years, in many places, far and near, in many books, and sundry languages, I have sought, and studied; and with sundry men conferred; and with my own reasonable discourse laboured, whereby to find or get some inkling, glimpse or beam of such foresaid radical truths.  But, (to be brief) after all my foresaid endeavor, I could find no other way, to such true wisdom attaining, but by thy extraordinary gift; and by no vulgar School Doctrine, or Human Invention. 
     And seeing, I have read in thy books, and records, how Enoch enjoyed thy favor and conversation, with Moses thou wast familiar. And also that to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; Joshua, Gideon, Esdras, Daniel, Tobias, and sundry others, thy good Angels were sent, by thy disposition to instruct them, inform them, help them, yea in worldly and domestic affairs, yea and sometimes to satisfy their desires, doubts and questions of thy Secrets.
     And furthermore considering the Shewstone, which the High Priests did use by thy own ordering wherein they had lights and judgments in their great doubts. And considering also that thou (O God) didst not refuse to instruct thy prophets (then, called seers) to give true answers to common people of things economical, as Samuel, for Saul, seeking for his father's asses being gone astray: and of other things vulgar, true predictions, whereby to win credit unto thy weightier affairs.  And thinking to myself, the lack of thy wisdom to me, to be of more importance, than the value of an ass or two, could be, to Saul's father. 
   And remembering what good counsel thy Apostle James gives, saying: 
  "Si quis autem vestrum indiget sapientiam, postulet a Deo, qui
   dat omnibus affluenter et non inproperat: et dabitur ei."
                                            Jacobi I:5
    "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask God, that giveth to all 
     men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." 
                                            James I:5
     And that Solomon the wise, did so, even immediately by thy self, attain to this wonderful wisdom.  Therefore, seeing I was sufficiently taught and confirmed, that this wisdom could not be come by at man's hand or by human power, but only from thee (O God) mediately or immediately. And having always a great regard and care to beware of the filthy abuse of such as willingly and wittingly, did invoke and consult (in diverse sorts) spiritual creatures of the damned sort: Angels of darkness, forgers and patrons of lies and untruths. I did fly unto thee by hearty prayer, full oft, and in sundry manners, sometimes crying unto thee:
  "Mittas Lucem tuam et veritatem tuam, quies me ducant etc."    
  "Send forth thy Light and truth that I might draw myself unto thee etc.            

sometimes: 
  "Recte sapere et intelligere doceto me, Nam sapientia tua totum est quod volo: etc."     
  "Teach me to properly sense and rightly discern, for I desire  
   your wisdom, because it is all that is." 

sometimes: 
  "Da verbum tuum in ore meo, et Sapientiam, tuam in corde meo fige etc."                     
"Give your word to my established practice and fix your wisdom in my heart."
     And having perceived by some slight experience, with two diverse persons, that thou hadst a special care to give me thy light, and truth, by thy, holy and true Ministers Angelic and Spiritual, and at length hearing of one (a Master of Art, and a preacher of thy word admitted) accounted as a good Seer, and skryer of Spiritual apparitions in Crystalline receptacle, or in open aire, by his practice, procured; and trusting to frame him, by my earnest and faithful prayers unto thee (my God) to seem my help in my foresaid studies; till, thou (O heavenly father) wouldest by thy unsearchable providence, send me some apter way or means thereto. Thereupon trying him and using him I found great diversity between his private usual manner, and intents of practice, and my pure, devout, and faithful prayer unto thee only. And therefore often and fervently I exhorted him to the good, and reproved both him, and his ministers, with my no small danger, but that thou (in manner unheard of) didst pitch thy holy tent to be my defense, and comfort, in conflict most terrible; as thou best knowest, o God, and I willed him thereupon to preach thy mercies and the verity of the kingly prophet his testimony; 
   "Immittet Angelus Domini, in circuitu timentium eum."  
   "The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him  
                                                     Psalms XXXIV:7 
     And out of Roger Bacon his book written: 
    "De mirabili potestate Artis et Naturae",
     "Concerning the wonderful power of Arts and of Nature"
(where he writes against the Wicked Devil Callers) I noted unto him this sentence: 
 "Facilius (sine comparatione a Deo * impetrandum foret, vel  
  a bonis spiritibus, quie quid homini utile reputare. etc.)" 
 "In order to free himself from difficulty (To reflect upon the 
  profit with which a man, may entreat the incomparable will   
  of God, as well as that of his good spirits etc.)"
which my counsel he promised me to follow, as thou art witness, O our true and almighty God. 
   And as thy good Spiritual Creatures neither had delight in the man, neither would so plainly and precisely give me their answers or informations by him, that he might be able to perceive the pith thereof. So was he at length very unwilling to hear himself rebuked for his naughtiness, and to be barred from the Mysteries of thy truths understanding; which were the only things that I desired, through thy grace; o our most merciful God.
   Therefore, as well for a Memorial answerable to the premises, as for the better warrant of my such exercises to be made account of hereafter: (leaving all unto thy infinite mercies, and unsearchable providence,) I have thought it not impertinent, to note down, even in this place one of the last Actions, which I had with the foresaid preacher; when I made earnest and faithful petitions unto thee (o the true and Almighty God) for sending, unto my comfort and erudition, (if it were thy blessed will) thy holy, and mighty Angel Annael.'. of whom and of all the Hierarchies heavenly all praise honor and thanks, be rendered unto thy divine majesty: now and ever and world without end. 
     Amen. Amen. Amen.

                      Anael#7, or no:
    ii Dee.         And Saul looking into my aforesaid Stone (or Crystal
     Note: An         Globe#8 for to espy Anael#9, he saw there one, which
     illuding#10      answered to that name. But being earnestly requested
     intruder,        of me to tell the Truth if he were Anael#11, another
     even at the      did appear very beautiful: with apparel yellow,
     the first,       glittering, like gold and his head had beams like
     putting          star beams, blazing, and spreading from it, his
     himself as       eyes fiery.#12
     an Angel of    He wrote in the stone very much in Hebrew letters,
     light#13. Take   and the letters seethed, all transparent gold.
     heed always      Which Saul was not able; either presently to read
     of undue         that I might write after his voice, neither imitate
     securities.      the letters in short time.
                    A bright star#14, did go up and down by him. There
    iii * Dee.        appeared also a White* dog, with a long head.
     There            And many other visions appeared with this second,
     appeared a       the first being voided quite away.
     great number   Thereupon I said, as followeth:
     of dead
     men's skulls   Dee: In nomine Jesu Christi, quis tu es#15?
     likewise#16:     In the name of Jesus Christ who art thou?
                    He answered; to Saul's hearing.

                    Annael: Potestas omnis, in me sita est.
                      All power, is vested in me.

                    Dee: Quae?
                      What powers?

                    Annael: Bona, et mala.
                      Good and bad.

                    Dee: Then appeared in the stone, these two letters:
                                    M.G.
                    I then asking him some questions, de Thesauro
                      abscondito#17 [about hidden Treasure]; he answered:

                    Annael: Ne perturbes: nam hac perturbes sunt Nugae.
                      Don't confuse thyself: for by these foolish
                      questions, thou throwest thyself into disorder.
                    And withal appeared many dead men's skulls, on his
                      left hand. He said to me:

                    Annael: Ubi est potestas tua?
                      Where is your power?







                    Dee: Cur quaeris de potestate aliqua mea?
                      Why do you seek for some object of my power?

                    Annael: Cur? Signifi, non mihi placet.
                      Why? As a Sign, not to please myself.

                    Dee: I, thereupon, set by him, the stone in the frame
    {Fig. 1}          and said: An bonus aliquis Angelus, assignatus est
                      huic speculo?
                      Is another good Angel assigned to this mirror#18?

                    Annael: Etiam.
                      Yes, indeed.

                    Dee: Quis?
                      Which?

                    Annael: (Michael) MYKAL#19

                      he answered, by the show of these letters in my
                      stone.
                    Dee: Bonus ne ille Angelus, de quo in scripturis
                      sit mentio?
                      Is that not the Good Angel, of whom mention is made
                      in the scriptures#20?

                    Annael: Maxime'.#21
                      Certainly!

                    Dee: Fieri ne potest, quod ego eundem videam, et
                      cum illo agam?
                      Might not it become possible, that I might see
                      what he does see; and when might I be able to do
                      that.

                    Annael Ita.
                      Thus.

                      and therewith appeared this character:

    {Fig. 2}                         A

                    Dee: Quid per hoc, significare velis?
                      To what significance does this veil allude?

                    Annael: Alterius Angeli character est.
                      It is the mark of another Angel.

                    Dee: Cur hic; et nunc ostendis?
                      And why do you now set this forth?

                    Annael: Causam ob magnam.
                      Because the cause is great.
                     Make an end: It shall be declared, but not by me.

                    Dee: By Whom then?

                    Annael: By him that is assigned to the stone: but not
                      till after the feast#22. And then thou must prepare






    iv Prayers and    thyself, to prayer and fasting#23. In the Name of
       fastings#24.   God, be Secret: and in all thy doings: praying,
                      till thou hast thy desire: Which shall not be far
                      off. After New Year's tide: Deal, But not on the
                      Sabbath#25 day.  Pray continually#26. When it shall
                      please god#27, to stir thee up; Then proceed.  In the
                      brightest day, When the Sun shineth: In the morning:
                      fasting, begin to pray. In the Sun Set the stone.
                      Deal both Kneeling, and Sitting. I have done for
                      this time.
                    My name is ANNAEL.
                    I will speak once more to thee; and then fare well;
                      for thou shalt not have me any more.
                               Be not too hasty in wrath#28.

                    Dee: Is this; that, you meant to speak?

                    Annael: Ay: Do good to all men; God hath sufficient
                      for thee, and for all men.
                                     Fare Well.

                    Dee:  Gloria patri et filio et spiritui sancto:
                         Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper:
                                et in saecula saeculorum
                                       Amen.
                     Glory to the father and the son and the holy ghost:
                          As it was in the beginning and, is now
                       and always shall be even unto the age of ages
                                       Amen.

    Dee: Remember, that diverse other particulars#29, might have been noted
         of this day's Action: but these may suffice.'.  And yet it is not
         to be forgotten, that as he said his name was Annael (with a
         double n#30.) So he also confessed himself to be the same Annael
         which is prepositus orbis Veneris#31 [set over the sphere of
         Venus]; and also: Chief governor General: of this great period,
         as I have noted in my book of;
                         Famous And Rich Discoveries#32.

                                 -oOo-

     Consider and Remember:
         That this Note; of the Action (had with holy ANNAEL), is of
         Prince Befafes#33, (otherwise called Obelison) accounted as the
         Prologue of my first book of mystical exercises.

2 Dee signifies his own name throughout this book with the character of the
Greek capital letter Delta, in form; an upright
  equilateral triangle.
3 Rev.I:20,II:7,III:1-6.
4 Sufficient textual evidence throughout the corpus of Dee's writings
demonstrates that he was practicing a manner of working in
  accordance with the Heptameron of Petri de Abano. We append the following
passage taken out of this context as an illustration:
  Considerations of Friday.
     The Angel of Friday, his Sigil, his Planet, the Signs governing that
Planet, and the name of the third heaven.  The Angels of
  Friday re: Anael, Rachiel, Sachiel.  The Angels of the Air reigning on
Friday are: Sarabotes, King.  Ministers.  Amabiel,
  Aba, Abalidoth, Flaef The wind which said Angels of the Air are under: The
West-wind.  Angels of the third heaven, ruling on
  Friday, which are to be called from the four parts of the world. At the
East: Setechiel, Chedusitaniel, Corat, Tamael, Teneciel.
  At the West: Turiel, Coniel, Babiel, Kadie, Maltiel, Huphaltiel. At the
North: Peniel, Penael, Penat, Raphael, Raniel, Doremiel.
  At the South: Porna, Sachiel, Chermiel, Samael, Santanael, Famiel.  The
perfume of Friday is Pepperwort.
     The Conjuration of Friday.
     I Conjure and confirm upon you, ye strong and holy angels, by the names
+ON+HEY+HEYA+JA+JE+SADAY+ADONAY+, and in the name
  +SADAY+, who created four-footed beasts, and creeping things, and man, in
the sixth day, and gave to Adam power over all
  creatures; wherefore blessed be the name of the Creator in his place; and by
the names of the angels serving in the third
  host, before Dagiel, a great angel, and a strong and powerful prince, and by
the name of his star, which is Venus, and by his
  seal which is holy; and by all the names aforesaid, I conjure upon thee,
Anael, who art chief ruler of this day, that thou
  labour for me, and fulfill all my petitions according to my will and desire
in my cause and business.
     The spirits of the Air of Friday are subject to the West-wind; their
nature is to give silver; to excite men, and incline
  them toward luxery; to make marriages; to allure men to love women; to
cause, or take away infirmities; and  to do all things
  which have motion.

6 Appended here is Dee's private diary for the year 1581; as it refers in some
detail to Saul Barnabas, and other circumstances
  surrounding this event:
    FEBRUARY 9: I agreed with Mr Gentle Godolphin for to release the cozener
[i.e. sneak-thief] Vincent Murphin.  Feb. 11: Harry
  Prise, of Lewsam, came to me at Mortlake, and told of his dreams often






repeated, and upon my prayer to God this night, his
  dream was confirmed, and better instruction given. Feb. 12: Sir William
Herbert came to Mortlake.  Feb. 23: I made aquaintance
  with Joannes Bodinus, in the Chamber of Presence at Westminister, the
ambassador being by from Monsieur.  Feb. 26: A very fair
  calm warm day.
    MARCH 8: It was the eighth day, being Wednesday, hora noctis 10 - 11 [i.e.
ten to eleven o'clock PM] the strange noise in my
  chamber of knocking; and the voice, ten times repeated, somewhat like the
screech of an owl, but more long drawn, and more
  softly, as it were in my chamber.  Mar. 12: All reckonings paid to Mr.
Hudson, œ11.17s.  Mar. 13: Elizabeth Kyrton came to
  my service.  Mar. 23: at Mortlake came to me Hugh Smith, who had returned
from Magellan's Straights and Vaygatz; after that,
  rain, stormy wind, south-west.  Mar. 25: Helen was hired at our Lady Day for
the year, for four nobles, wages; she had her
  covenant penny, and also 6s., 8d. for her pains taken since she came.
    APRIL 3: I ride towards Sneedgreen, to John Brown, to hear and see the
manner of the doings.  Apr. 14: I came home from
  Sneedgreen.
    MAY 25: I had sight in Crystal [Gk. krystallw] offered me, and I saw.
    JUNE 7: hora 7 1/2 mane nata est [i.e. at 7:30 AM the birth occurred of]
Katharina Dee.  Jun. 10: baptisata a meridie
  hor. 5 1/2 Katharina [i.e. she was baptised at 5:30 AM].  Mr Packington of
the court, my Lady Katherine Crofts, wife to Sir
  James Crofts, Mr Controller of the Queen's household, Ms Mary Skydmore of
the Privy Chamber, and cousin to the Queen, by their
  deputies christened Katherine Dee.  Jun. 17: Young Mr Hawkins, who had been
with Sir Francis Drake, came to me to Mortlake.
  Jun. 30: Mr John Leonard Haller. of Hallerstein, by Worms in Germany,
received his instructions manifold for his journey
  to Quinsay, which journey I moved him unto, and instructed him plentifully
for the variation of the compass, observing in all
  places as he passed.
    JULY 6: My wife churched.  Jul. 7: In the morning at 1 3/4 after midnight,
Mr Hind's son born.  Jul. 10: My right shoulder
  and elbow-joint were so extremely in pain that I was not able in fourteen
days to lift my arm outward, not an inch; the pain
  was extreme.  I used Mr Larder, Mr Alles, and Alice Davies, and about the
twenty-fifth day I mended.  Jul. 12: About ten of
  the clock 1/2 before noon [[Gk. roger 'is inkredible doggednes and
ingratefulness agains me to mi fake, almost redi to lai
  violent ands on me, mager enrik kan parteli tel. = Roger's incredible
doggedness and ungrantfulness against me to fake,
  almost ready to lay violent hands on me, Mr. Henrick can partly tell.]  At
the same day the Earl of Leister fell foully out
  with the Earl of Sussex, calling each other traitor, whereupon both were
commanded to keep their chambers at Greenwich,
  where the court was.  Jul. 19: Mr Henrick came to London to visit his wife
and children.  Jul. 26: Mr Henrick came, and
  goodman King with him.  Jul. 28: Mr Collins did ride into Lincolnshire.
    AUGUST 3: All the night very strange knocking and rapping in my chamber,
Aug. 4: and this night likewise.  Katherine
  was sent home from Nurse Maspely, of Barnes, for fear of her maid's
sickness, and goodwife Bennet gave her suck.  Aug. 11:
  Katherine Dee was shifted to nurse Garret at Petersham on Friday, the next
day after St Lawrence's Day, being the eleventh






  day of the month; my wife went on foot with her, and Ellen Cole, my maid,
George and Benjamin, in very great showers of rain.
  Aug. 12: Recepi literas a D. Doctore Andrea Hess occultae philosophiae
studioso, per Richardi Hesketh amici mei, Antwerpiae
  agentis, diligentiam in negociis meis, et recepi, una cum literis, Mercurii
Mensitam seu Sigillam Planetarum [i.e. received a
  letter from Andrew Hess D.D., a man studied in occult philosophy, by means
of my friend Richard Hesketh, my agent from Antwerp;
  diligent in his dealings for me, and has received, along with the letter,
the Mensitam, or planetary seal, of Mercury.]
  Aug. 26: About 8 1/2 (at night) a strange meteor in the form of a white
cloud crossing the galaxiam [L.=The Milky Way] when
  it lay north and south over our zeneth; and this cloud was at length from
the south-east to the south-west sharp at both ends,
  and in the west end it was forked for awhile: it was about sixth degrees
high, it lasted an hour, all the sky clear about, and
  fair star-shine.
    SEPTEMBER 5: Roger Cook, who had been with me from his fourteenth year of
age till twenty-eight, of a melancholy nature,
  picking and devising occassions of just cause to depart on the sudden, about
four of the clock in the afternoon requested of my
  license to depart, whereupon rose hot words between us; and he, imagining
with himself that he had the 12th of July deserved my
  great displeasure and finding himself barred from view of my philosophical
dealing with Mr Henrick, thought that he was utterly
  recessed from intended goodness toward him.  Notwithstanding Roger Cook's
unseemly dealing, I promised him, if he used himself
  toward me now in his absence, one hundred pounds as soon as of my own clean
ability I might spare so much; and moreover,
  if he used himself well in life toward God and the world, I promised him
some pretty alchemical experiments, whereupon he might
  honestly live.  Sep. 7: Roger Cook went forth altogether from me. Sep. 29:
Robert Gardner, of Shrewsbury, came to my service.
    OCTOBER 8: I had news of the chests of books found by Owndle in
Northamptonshire; Mr Barnabas Saul told me of them, but I
  found no truth in it.  Oct. 9: Barnabas Saul, lying in the . . . hall was
strangely troubled by a spiritual creature about
  midnight. Oct. 13: I rode to South Mimes,  Oct. 14: to St Needs, Oct. 16: at
Mr Hickman's,  Oct. 20: at Tosseter,  Oct. 21:
  Oxford; Dr Cradock,  Oct. 23: from Oxford to Wyckam.  Oct. 24: I came home.
Robert Hilton came to my service.
    NOVEMBER 16: the Queen removed to Whitehall, and Monsieur with her.  Nov.
27: I rode to Greenside.  Nov. 28: to goodman
  Wykham, two miles beyond Chayly by Lewys.  Nov. 29: I made aquintance with
Mr George Kylmer for Sir George's books.  Nov. 30
  I came home.
    DECEMBER 1: Katherine Dee's nurse was paid 6s., so nothing is owing to
her.  Dec. 5: Ellen my maid fell sick.  Dec. 7:
  George my man had the great fall off the ladder, hora 10 fere mane [i.e.
about 10:00 AM].  Dec. 8: I sent a letter to Mr Kylmer.
  Dec. 22: My Lord Chancellor's son, Mr Bromley, and Sir William Herbert came
to me.  Helen Cole was paid her wages and
  reckonings til this Christmas, and so discharged [from] my service, being
newly recovered of her ague.  Her desire was to go to
  her friends.

9 Davidson equates Anael with Haniel, Hanael, Hamiel, Aniel and even Onoel
(One of the 7 Gnostic archons). As one of the 7 angels
  of creation; a chief of principalities, virtues, angels and innocents and a
prince of archangels, Anael is attributed to Friday,
  Venus and rules over the sexual functions among other things.
     Gustav Davidson, A Dictionary Of Angels (London: Collier-Macmillan Ltd.,
1967)pp.17,48,134,213.
10 illuding (rare) = mocking from L. illudere: to mock at, ridicule.
11 Aggripa assigns Haniel to the planet Venus and her sphere Nogah (nun-ayin-
gimel-heh) under the rule of Jehovah Zebaoth
   (cf. Thelema, Apr.88) in Netzach (nun-tzaddi-heh) the third heaven . Also
attributed to this angel are the month of
   December and sign of Capricorn, thus quite presicely fullfilling the
magical criterion for just such an operation as
   is here given.
12 'Familiar shapes of the Spirits of Venus:
      They do appear with a fair body, of middle stature, with an amiable and
pleasant countenance, of colour white or green,
    the upper part golden. The motion of them is as if it were a most clear
Star.', op.cit. Occult Philosophy p.45.
13 ' an Angel of Light ' id est Lucifer = L. lux + fer; lit. light bearing;
proper name of the Morning Star, i.e. Venus; transf.
   the angel of light. cf. Isa. XIV:12, Rev.I:12-20, II:7, III:1-6, XXII:1-5.

17 "Dee askes de Thesauro abscondito receives an evasive answer. "This note is
from a fair copy of this text in an unknown hand
   at the end of Libri Quinti Appendix, SL. MSS.3188 fol. 123. And is
interesting not only because this question is seemingly
   reasonable, given note 2. above, but also in light of the fact that both
Dee's future relationship with Edward Talbot and
   much of the dealings covered in note 32 depended on the success of his
ability to accertain such information.
18 Possibly an obsidian mirror owned by Dee and still extant. Probably also
related to the events of June 17, 1581. Note that
   by reckoning Dee's first address, and the speech immediately preceding this
cited passage, the sum of Stones equals two.

30 This confusion over spelling probably derives from the appearance of this
name in the Book of Tobit [I:21]. It is rendered

originally written in Hebrew as HNNAL

uncompleted larger work referred to by Dee as the
   IMPERIUM BRITTANICUM which is now for the most part lost. An outline; some
fragments of text, and commentaries upon it by
   other authors [cf. Purchas, Camden] do exist in various published and MSS.
form. It was to contain besides this text;
   General And Rare Memorials, a work on the paradoxical compass and sundry
speculations on matters historical, political,
   and geographical.  Extant portions of this book purport to trace the
lineage of the English Monarchy through the antediluvian
   mythos and compare the Ophirian Voyages of Solomon [Josephus Antiq:
lib.viii cap.6] with the quasi-historical Arthurian
   quest for the graal to support British geopolitical claims and aspirations.
     Substantial scholarly evidence supports the premise that plans now lost
with the logs used by Sir Francis Drake in his
   exploratory and privateering activities were based on these materials by
Dee. As are the known works of other
   Elizabethan Navigators. Dee seemingly associated the reign of Elizabeth to
a venusian current that posited an expansion
   of the British Dominion through the favor of the God of Hosts and the
intercession of his holy angels.
     It is evident that certain keys to establishing a cabalum linguae
anglicae de enochiana particulari per De Collectanarum
   Heptarchia Mystica et Liber Scientia Auxilii Et Victoria Terrestis lies in
further research in the materials related to this book.

               Center for Enochian Studies, Volume I, No. 6:


        The Action Of 11:15am Saturday March 10th MDLXXXII era vulgaris:
        Being the First Spiritual Exercise with Edward Talbot (ne Kelly)


        Mortlake
                            In nomine Jesv CHRISTI:
                                    Amen.
                          In the name of Jesus CHRIST.
                                    Amen.

        Anno 1582. Marty die 10. hora 11 1/4 Ante Meridiem, Saterday.

    i.  One Mr. Edward Talbot came* to my house, and he being willing and
        desirous to see, or show, something in spiritual practice, would
        have had me to have done something therein. And I truly excused
        myself therein; as not, in the vulgarly accounted Magick [#1], neither
        studied, or exercised. But confessed myself long time to have been
        desirous to have help in my philosophical studies through the
        company and information of the blessed Angels of God [#2]. And
        thereupon I brought I forth to him my stone in the frame (which was
        given me of a friend) and I said unto him that I was credibly
        informed that to it (after a sort) were answerable:
                               Aliqui Angeli boni:
                               Various good Angels.
        And also that I was once willed by a skryer, to call for the good
        Angel Anchor, to appear in that stone to my own sight. And
        therefore I desired to call him and (if he would) Anachor and
        Anilos likewise, accounted good Angels, for I was not prepared
        thereunto [#3], etc. He then settled himself to the Action, and on his
        knees at my desk (setting the stone before him) fell to prayer and
        entreaty etc. In the mean space, I in my Oratory did pray and make
        motion to God and his good Creatures for the furthering  of this
        Action [#4]. And within one quarter of an hour (or less) he had sight
        of one in the Stone. But he still expected for two more: deeming
        this to be one of the three (namely Anchor, Anachor, Anilos). But I
        then came to him, to the stone, and required to know his name. And
        he spake plainly, (to the hearing of E.T.) that his name is Uriel[#5].

        DEE: Are you one of  them (said I, John Dee) that are answerable,
        (upon due observations performed) to this stone?

        URIEL: I am.

        Dee: Are there any more beside you?

        Uriel: Michael and Raphael. But Michael est princeps in operibus
        nostris.
                                     ...Michael is the foremost in our
        working.

        Dee: Is my book of Soyga [#6] of any excellency?

        Uriel: Liber ille, erat Adae in Paradiso revelatus, per Angelos Dei
        bonos.
               It is that book, which was revealed to Adam in Paradise, by
        the good Angels of God.







        Dee: Will you give me any instructions, how I may read those Tables
        of Soyga [#7].

        Uriel: I can. But solus Michael illius libri est interpretatur.
                       ...only Michael is the interpreter of that book.

        Dee: I was told; that after I could read that book, I should live
        but two years and a half.

        Uriel: Thou shalt live an hundred and odd years [#8].

        Dee: What may I, or must I do, to have the sight and presence of
        Michael, that blessed Angel?

        Uriel: Praesentias nostris postulate et invocate, sinceritate et
        humilitate. Et Anchor, Anachor, et Anilos, non sunt in hanc lapidem
        invocandi.
               Sincerely and humbly; demand and invoke our presence. But
        Anchor, Anachor, Anilos are not to be invoked into this stone.

        Dee: Oh my great and long desire hath been to be able to read those
        tables of Soyga.

        Uriel: Haec maxime' respicunt Michaelem. Michael est Angelas; qui
        illuminat gressus tuos. Et haec revelantur in virtute et veritate
        non Vi.
               This pertains especially to Michael; Michael is an Angel,
        who shines over us. And this revelation is in virtue and truth not
        Power.

        Dee: Is there any special time, or hour to be observed, to deal for
        the enjoyning of Michael?

        Uriel: Omnis hora, est hora nobis.
               Every hour that is our hour [#9].

    ii. Dee: After there appeared in the stone a strange Seal or
        Characterismus* of the fashion ensuing:

 [See the printed edition for the illustration that goes here]

        Dee: What is the intent, or use, of this?

   iii. Uriel*: Sigilum hoc in sculpendum, ad defensionem corporis omni,
        loco, tempore et occasione; et in pectus gestandum'.
                 This Sigil is to be carved in gold, as a defense for the






        body, in all places, times, and circumstances, and is to be worn on
        the breast.

        Dee: So we ceased, with thanks to God, and I mused much upon this
        Action, and laid all up in mind, and writing.

                         Soli Deo Honoi omnis, et gloria.
                                      Amen.
                        Only to God be all honor and glory.
                                      Amen.

                                      .oOo.

        i. Dee. Note: he had two days before made the like demand and
        request unto me, but he went away unsatisfied. For his coming was
        to entrap me, if I had had any dealing with wicked spirits, as he
        confessed often times after, and that he was set on, etc [#10].

        ii. Dee. An Illuding Spirit straightaway intruded himself and this
        character as may appear Libri Quinti appendice where the character
        is described exactly. [#11]

        iii. This was not true Uriel, as may appear Anno 1583: May 5. [#12]



        ____________END NOTES______________________________________________

1 "The 'magick' which made use of the invocation of evil or doubtful spirits
   was of course always regarded as sinful; but natural magic, i.e. that which
   did not involve recourse to the agency of personal spirits, was in the
   Middle Ages usually recognized as a legitimate department of study and
   practice, so long as it was not applied to malificent ends.  Of 'natural
   magic' as understood by mediaeval writers, astrologicalconditions, in order
   to injure or benefit the health of the person represented; and the
   application of a medicament to a weapon in order to heal the wound made by
   it.  These things, if now practiced would still be called 'magic' though
   the qualification 'natural' would seem quite inappropriate. On the other
   hand the 'natural magick' of the Middle Ages included much that from the
   standpoint of modern science is 'natural' but not 'magical', the processes
   resorted to being really, according to the now known laws of physical
   causation, adapted to produce the intended effects."  Taken from the Oxford
   English Dictionary entry of 'magic' to which the interested student is
   referred. A comprehensive study of the texts therein cited will give a
   invaluable understanding of the meaning and usage of this concept
   throughout the history of the English language.

2 vide Thelema Lodge O.T.O. (April and May 1988 e.v.)

3 It would seem that Dee is either testing E.T. or more likely stalling for
  time, as the use of these angels pertains to the preliminary preparation of
  the magician, that is literally getting dressed before the Action proper.

4 Various points of internal evidence here indicate that Dee is following the
  instructions given by Peter of Abano in his Magical Elements (op cit.
  Agrippa, The Fourth Book, and Barrett, The Magus). This would include
  several preliminary conjurations in Latin, a number of ritual actions, a
  recitation of the





 Lord's Prayer or the Paternoster in conjunction with
  various traditional catholic supplications, and probably the particular
  invitation to the Angels attributed to Saturday.

5 A fuller discussion of the nature and office of Uriel will be given in the
  appropriate place, but it is notable that he is one of the angels listed as
  answerable to the Conjurations of Saturday by Abano in the Heptameron.

6 The question of what Dee is referring to with regards to his Book or Tables
  of Soyga has yet to be absolutely resolved by any scholarship in this area.
  A number of theories have been postulated and further research may yet come
  to some conclusive answer to this puzzling enigma.

7 "Soyga = agyos", a note from the fair copy of this action in Libri Quinti
  Appendix equating 'soyga' with a transposition of the spelling of the Greek
  word meaning holy.

8 Dee actually lived for 71 years.

9 This point which obviously refers to the use of the Government Of Hours is
  notable as only Michael and Raphael are questionable as to the correct
  calculation of their appropriate times. The resolution of which depends on
  how they are attributed to the sephiroth.

10  The private circumstances of Dr. Dee's life leading to the events herein
    discussed:

   1582. JANUARY 11th Robert Gardener desired my leave to go dwell with Sir
   William Herbert, hora 12. Jan. 16th Mistress Herbert came to Essex.
   Jan. 17th Randal Hatton came home from Samuel's father at Stratton Audley.
   Jan. 22nd Arthur Dee and Mary Herbert, they being but 3 year old the
   eldest, did make as it were a show of childish marriage, of calling each
   other husband and wife. Jan. 22nd and 23rd The first day Mary Herbert came
   to her father's house at Mortlake, and the second day she came to her
   father's house at Estshene. Jan. 23rd My Wife went to nurse Garret and paid
   her for this month ending the 26th day. Jan. 27th Barnabas Saul's brother
   came.
        FEBUARY 12th About 9 of the clock Barnabas Saul and his brother Edward
   went homeward from Mortlake. Saul's indictment being by law found
   insufficient at Westminster Hall: Mr. Serjant Walmesley, Mr. Owen and Mr.
   Hyde, his lawyers at the bar for the matter. And Mr. Ive, the clerk of the
   crown Office favouring the other. Feb. 20th Mr. Bigs of Stentley by
   Huntingdon and John Littlechild came to me. I received a letter from
   Barnabas Saul. Feb. 21st Mr. Skullthorp rude toward Barnabas. Feb. 25th
   Mr. Skullthorp came home. Paid Nurse Garret for Katherine till Friday the
   23rd day, viz. then something due to nurse for iij. lbs. of candle and
   4 lbs. of soap.
        MARCH 1st Mr. Clerkson brought Magnus to me at Mortlake, and so went
   that day again. Mar. 6th Barnabas Saul came this day again about one
   o'clock and went to London the same afternoon. He confessed that he neither
   heard or saw any spiritual creature any more. Mar. 8th Mr. Clerkson and his
   friend came to my house. Barnabas went home again about 2 or 3 o'clock,
   he went I say, on Thursday with Mr. Clerkson. Mar. 8th Coelum ardere et
   instar sanguinis in diversis partibus rubere visum est circa horam nonam
   noctis, maxime versus sepentriolem et occidentalem partem: sed ultra capita
   nostra





 versus austrum frequenter miles quasi sanguines. Mar. 9th Friday at
   dinner time Mr. Clerkson and Mr. Talbot* declared a great deal of Barnabas
   naughty dealing toward me, as in telling Mr. Clerkson ill things of me,
   that I would so flatter his friend; the learned man, that I would borrow
   him of him. But his Friend told me that Barnabas had censured both
   Mr. Clerkson and myself. The injuries which this Barnabas had done me
   diverse ways were very great.

   * You that read this, the underwritten assure yourself that it is a
   shameful lie, for Talbot neither studied for any such thing nor showed
   himself dishonest in anything.

   Dee: This is Talbot or that 'learned man,' his own writing in my book, very
   unduly as he came by it.

   The above edited from the Private Diary Of Dr. John Dee, op.cit.

11 This sigil is clearly false the correct arrangement relates to the Tabula
   Sancta or Holy Table and is dealt with in the next action. The passages
   cited here are from Dee's appendix and will be given in full, in their
   proper context accompanying the next article in this series.

12 Ibid. but note also this passage from Abano's
             Considerations of Saturday:
   "Those are the figures that these spirits usually assume, which are
   generally terrible at the first coming on of the visions, but as they have
   only a limited power, beyond which they cannot pass, so the invocator need
   be under no apprehensions of danger, provided he is well fortified with
   those things we have directed to be used for his defense, and above all,
   to have a firm and constant faith in the mercy, wisdom, and goodness of
   God."

        The same Saturday afternoon. Hora 5. [#1}

        Dee: After that Mr. Edward Talbot [#2] had called Uriel, and I was
        come to the Stone, and had used a short speech of thanks to God. [#3]
        I then required some Instructions for the purposes of Soyga [#4].

        Uriel: Peace, you must use Michael.

        Dee: I know no means or order to use in the invocation of Michael.
           [Note: Dee - In this time there appeared in the stone a rich






        Chair and after a little while it was out of sight.]
        Uriel: He is to be invoked by certain of the psalms of David and
        prayers. The which psalms, are nothing else, but a means unto the
        seat and Majesty of God. Whereby you gather with yourselves due
        power to apply your natures to the holy Angels. I mean the psalms
        commonly called the Seven Psalms [#5]. You must use pleasant savours,
        with hand and heart: whereby you shall allure him and win him
        (through God's favor) to attain unto the thing, you have long
        sought for.
             There must be a conjunction of minds in prayer betwixt you
        two, to God continually.  It is the will of God, that you should
        jointly, have the knowledge of his Angels together.
             You had attained unto the sight of Michael, but for the
        imperfection of Saul [#6].  Be of good comfort.
           [Dee - The chair came into the Stone again and I asked what it
        meant.]
        Uriel: This is a seat of perfection: from which, all things shall
        be showed unto thee, which thou hast long  desired.
           [Dee - Then was there was a square Table brought unto the Stone:
        and I demanded, what that Table betokened.]
        Uriel: A Mystery not yet to be known. These two, shall remain in
        the stone; to the sight of all undefiled creatures.
             You must use a four-square Table, two Cubits [#7] square:
        whereupon must be set Sigillum Dei [#8], which is already * perfected
   i.   in a book [#9] of thine: Blessed be God in all his Mysteries, and Holy
        in all his works. This Seal must not be looked on without great
        Reverence and Devotion. This Seal is to be  made of perfect wax
        which is clean purified: we have no respect of Colours [#10].
             This Seal must be 9 inches in Diameter: The roundness must be
        27 inches and somewhat more. The thickness of it must be an inches
        and half a quarter, and the figure of a Cross, must be on the back
        of it thus [#11];

             [SEE PRINTED EDITION FOR ILLUSTRATION]

             The Table is to be made of sweet wood [#12] and to be of two
        Cubits high, with 4 feet: with 4 of the former seals under the 4
        feet.
           [Dee: The fashion of the 4 feet, standing upon the foresaid
        round Seals was shewed, so as the uttermost circle containing the
   ii.  letters, did seem to be clean * without the compass the feet,
        equally round about the same feet. And these Seals were shewed much
        lesser than the principal Seal.
             Under the Table did seem to be laid red silk, two yards
        square. And over the Seal: did seem likewise red silk to lie four-
        square: somewhat broader than the Table, hanging down with 4 knops
        or tassels at the 4 corners thereof.
             Upon this uppermost red silk, did seem to be set the stone
        with the frame: right over, and upon the principal Seal: saving
        that the said silk was between the one and the other.
   iii.      The Table was shewed to have on the 4 sides of it * Characters
        and Names, these, that are herein a schedule annexed, in diverse
        rows [#13].]

        Uriel: The Characters and words on the sides of this Square Table,
        are to be written with yellow, made of perfect oil, used in the
        church [#14].

        Dee: What oil is that?







        Uriel: Of That oil shall be opened unto you. The oil is perfect
        prayers: of other oil I have no respect.
             We sanctify, because we are holy: and you sanctify because of
        your holiness.

             [SEE PRINTED EDITION FOR ILLUSTRATION] [#15]

        Uriel: There is a spirit named Lundrumgutta using you. Who seeketh
        your destruction, in the hatred of men, in the hurt of thy goods.
        Discharge him tomorrow with Brimstone [#16]. He haunteth thy house,
        and seeketh the destruction of thy daughter. His pretense was to have
        maimed thee in thy shoulder the last night and long ago. If thou do
        not discharge him tomorrow, he will hurt both thy wife and thy
        daughter.
   iv.       He is here * now.
             Give him discharge from your and house. He will seek Saul's
        Death who is accursed.

        Dee: I know no means or art too do this by. For I did burn in flame
        of Brimstone, Maherion his name and Character, when I found Saul
        privily dealing with him, (which manner of wicked dealing I had
        forbidden him) and yet he came after, and would have carried Saul
   v.   away quick; as Robert Hilton, George; and other of my house can
        testify.

        Uriel: The Cursed will come to the Cursed.

        Dee: I beseech you to discharge him and bind him some where far
        off, as Raphael did (for Tobias sake) with the wicked Spirit
        Asmodeus [#17].

        Uriel: But Tobias did his part. Art is vain, in respect of God his
        power. Brimstone is a means.

        Dee: When shall I do this?

        Uriel: Tomorrow at the time of prayers.

        Dee: Gloria patri et filio et spiritui sancto, sicut etc. Amen.

                                    .oOo.

        *
        i. Erratice, contra ignorantia mea: vide post.
           An error; in opposition to my ignorance, observe what follows.

        ii. Note this point.

        iii. Cave: quia Angelus tenebrarum se intrusit hic, ut Libri Quinti
        Appendice apparabit.
             Be careful; those angels which are of the darkness intrude in
        this, as will appear in the appendix to these five books.

        iv. So it is evident who went about to hinder the truth before in
        the character, and in the border of the Table falsely counterfeited
        etc.: as it also in the next action may appear.

        v. Saul in danger of being carried away quick.

13 The construction of the table of practice and of the holy lamen is an
   involved and interrelated problem. It is, as is noted here and elsewhere,
   discussed at great length and depth in Libri Quinti Appendice, but even in
   that context the material poses many complex and difficult problems. It is
   of some comfort that Dee and Kelly were themselves quite confounded on
   the same points which presently cause scholars difficulty, and it is
   unfortunate that these particular objects of ceremonial furniture have all
   been lost through the course of time, but sufficient instruction and
   evidence does exist to draw fairly concrete albeit still disputable
   conclusions with regards to the important specifics of construction.
        The October edition of this series will contain a special supplement
   discussing in detail the furniture required preliminary, for the practice
   of Dee's system of Angelic Magick. In it we shall reproduce all pertinent
   passages from Dee's own MSS, provide and substantiate our own conclusions
   in these matters and provide some practical guidelines to actual
   reproduction. Interested persons should examine the various published
   studies of these matters:

   fifth through twenty-seventh, and the thirty-eighth through fifty-third

        1582  Marty 11
           Sonday. a Meridie hora .a. circiter [#1].
                                   3

          Dee-- Uriel being called by Edward Talbot there appeared one;
        clothed with a long robe of purple all spangled with gold, and on
        his head a garland, or wreath of gold, his eyes sparkling. Of whom
        I asked whether the characters noted for the Table were perfect:
          He answered,

   i.     *Lundrumguffa: They are perfect. There is no question [#2].

          Dee: Are you Uriel?
        Then presently came in one, and threw the brave spirit down by the
        shoulders, and beat him mightily with a whip; and took all his
        robes, and apparel off him.: And then he remained all hairy and
        ugly; and still the spirit was beaten of him, who came in after
        him. And that spirit, which so beat him, said to the hearing of my
        Skryer:

          Uriel: Lo, thus are the wicked scourged.

          Dee: Are you Uriel, who speaketh that?

          Uriel: I am he. Write down, and mark this; for it is worthy of
        the Noting:
   ii.    *This was thy persecutor Lundrumguffa. I brought him hither to
        let thee see, how God hath punished thy enemy.
          Lo, thus hath God dealt for thee: Lo, thus have I dealt for thee:
          Thank God.

          Dee: Blessed be his holy name, and extolled, World Without end.

          Edward Talbot-- He drew the wicked spirit away by the legs; and
        threw him into a great pit, and washed his hands, as it were, with
        the sweat of his own head: for he seemed to be all in a sweat.

          Dee-- Hereupon, my skryer saw Uriel go away, and he remained out
        of sight a little while. Then he came in again; and another with
        him, and jointly these two said together:
          Glorify  God forever.
          And then Uriel did stand behind; and the other did sit down in
        the chair with a sword in his right hand, all his head glittering
        like the sun.  The hair of his head was long, he had wings, and all
        his lower parts seemed to be with feathers. He had a robe over his
        body, and a great light in his left hand.
          He said:

          Michael: We are blessed from the beginning, and blessed  be the
        name of God forever.

          Dee-- My Skryer saw an innumerable Company of Angels about him.
        And Uriel did lean on the Square Table by.
          He that sat in the chair (whom we take to be Michael) said then:

          Michael: Go forward. God hath blessed thee.
          I will be thy Guide.
          Thou shalt attain unto thy seeking.






          The world begins with thy doings.
          Praise God.
          The Angels under my power, shall be at thy commandment.
          Lo, I will do thus much for thee.
          Lo, God will do thus much for thee.
          Thou shalt see me, and I will be seen of thee.
          And I will direct thy liking and conversation.
   iii.   *Those that sought thy life, are vanished away.
          Put up thy pen.

          Dee-- So he departed.
             
                    Gloria, laus, honor, Virtus et Imperium.
         Deo immortali, invisibili, et Omnipotenti, in saecula saeculorum.
                 Glory, praise, honor, to the Power and Authority.
          Unto God immortal, invisible, and Omnipotent, world without end.
                                  Amen.
                                  .oOo.

        i. Hereby may appear that this wicked spirit foisted in the shew of
        the false character and names before.

        ii. Note: Lundrumguffa scourged spiritually.

        iii. Lundrumguffa.

Thelema Lodge Calendar/Newsletter for October 1988 e.v.

        Center for Enochian Studies, Volume I, No. 8:


        "Marty. 14. Wensday. mane circa hora: 9"[#1].

        Dee - Being desirous to proceed in this manner by consent, we bent
        ourselves to the Action.  And after that Edward Talbot had called
        Uriel and saw him, I came to the desk from my Oratory.
             There did continually appear the Chair and the Table[#2].
             I then being afraid that any other should come in to the Stone
        instead of Uriel[#3], did earnestly require the spiritual creature
        appearing, to shew who he was, and what was his name.  At length he
        answered, and said to the hearing of Edward Talbot:

   i.   Uriel is my name, with difference called *Nariel[#4].
             Stay.

        Dee - Then he went away for a while; and came again, and said
        thus:

        Uriel: The strength of God is always with thee.  Dost thou know
        what thou writest?

        Dee - In two senses, I may understand it; either that the good
        Angel ii.  Dee Gabriel is always with me, though invisibly: or
        else that the strength, and mighty hand of God, always is my defence.

        Uriel: "Fortitudo Dei, tecum"[#5]" semper est."
               'The strength of God is always with you.'

        Dee - He went away again, and came again, following or waiting
        upon another, and before that other, was a man having his head all
        covered with black. Then he that came so in the middle, did sit
        down in the chair, and spoke this word following:

        Michael: Note.

        Dee - This was Michael, with his sword in his right hand. Then
        came Uriel to the man (having his head all hid, as it were in a
        black hood) and took off that black hood; and then lifted up the
        Table cloth.  He looked under it, and put it down again; and lifted
        it up again.  The Man stood still before Michael. Then Michael
        rose; and took off all the man's clothes, and left him as it were,
        only in his shirt.
             Then Uriel took a little round Tablet, as it were, of the
        bigness of a six pence, having two letters in it thus:



                                  <<1>>




        And gave it to Michael.  Uriel lifted up the Table cloth; and
        from thence, seemed to take apparel, and put it on the man, it
        seemed to be silk: and very full of wrinkles or pleats.  And the
        man kneeled, and held up his hand.  Uriel took like a Laurel bush[#6]
        and set upon the man's head. And then the man kneeled before
        Michael. Michael took the round thing with the Letters; and
        gave it to the man to eat, and he did eat it.

        Uriel: Lo are things covered.

        Dee - Then he covered the Table and plucked the cloth over it,
        down to the ground, on every side.  The man rose up: and Michael
        dubbed him on the head with his sword.  Then the man stood up.
        Then the man turned his face towards [Edward Talbot] the Skryer,
        and the man did resemble me (John Dee) in countenance. And then he
        turned to Michael again.
             Michael wrote upon the Man's back thus:
                          ANGELVS TVAE[#7] PROFESSIONES
                         THE ANGEL OF YOUR PROFESSION

   iii. Dee - Then Edward Talbot asked me, if there were such Angels of a
        Man's Profession: and I answered yea; as in Agrippa, and others is
        declared.

        Michael: Leave your folly.  Hold thy peace.
             Have you not read, that they that cleave unto God; are like
        unto him.

        Dee - Yes forsooth.

        Michael: Thou camest hither to learn, and not to dispute.
          "Laudate Dominum in operibus suis"[#8]."
         The Lard is praised in his workings

        Dee - The man kneeled down, and so went out of sight.

        Michael: He has eaten strength against trouble.
             He has eaten nothing, and in eating, he has eaten all things.
   iv.  The + name NA[#9] be praised in trouble.

        Dee - Now Michael thrust out his right arm; With the Sword, and
        bade the Skryer to look.  Then his Sword did cleave in two, and a
        great fire flamed out of it vehemently.  Then he took a Ring out of
        the flame of his sword, and gave it to Uriel, and said thus:

        Michael: The strength of God is unspeakable. Praised be God
        forever and ever.

        Dee - Then Uriel did make curtsy unto him.

        Michael: After this sort must thy Ring be. Note it.

        Dee - Then he rose and disappeared out of the Chair.  And by and
        by came again, and said as follows:

        Michael: I will reveal this Ring which was never revealed since
        the death of Solomon; with whom I was present, I was present with
        him in strength and mercy.
             Lo this is it; This is it where with all Miracles and divine
        works and wonders were wrought by Solomon[#10]:





                                  <2>

        This is it, which I have revealed unto thee:  This is it, which
        philosophy dreamth of.  This is it which the Angels scarce know.
        This is it, and blessed be his Name. Yea his name be blessed
        forever.

        Dee - Then he laid the Ring down upon the Table and said:

        Note.

        Dee - It shewed to be a Ring of gold: with a seal engraved in it,
        and had a round thing in the middle of the Seal, and a thing like a
        V through the top of the circle, and an L in the bottom, and a bar
        clean through it.    <3>

   v.   And had 4 Letters in it, P.E.L.E.[#11]
             After that,he threw the Ring on the board or Table[#12]; and it
   vi.  seemed to fall through the Table, and he said thus:

        Michael: So shall it do, at thy commandment.
             Without this thou shalt do nothing.
             Blessed be his name that compasseth[#13] all things.
             Wonders are in him, and his Name is WONDERFUL:
             His name worketh wonders from generation, to generation.

        Dee - Then he went away, and came in again by and by.

        Michael: Note.

        Dee - Then he brought in the Seal, which he had shewed the other
        day: and opened his Sword, and bade the Skryer: read: and he read:
   vii.                         EMETH[#14]
             Then the Sword closed up again, and he said:

        Michael: This I do open unto thee, because thou marveled at
        SIGILLVM DEI[#15]. This is the Name of the Seal[#16], which be blessed
        forever.  This is the Seal self[#17]. This is Holy. This is pure. This
        is forever. Amen.

        Dee - Then the Seal vanished away.  And I said to my friend (the
        Skryer): Indeed, this other day, I considered diverse fashions of
        this Seal; and I found them much differing, one from another; and
        therefore I had need to know which of them I shall imitate, or how
        to make one perfect of them all.

        Michael: Doubt not the making of it, for God has perfected all
        things. Ask not for the cause of my absence, nor of my apparel: for
        that Mystery is known to God. I have no clothing, as thou thyself
        shalt see.  I am a spirit of Truth and Virtue.  Yea you shall see
        me in Power, and I will visit you in HOPE.
             Bless you the Lord, and follow his ways forever.

        Dee - Then he went away, and Uriel followed him.  And then I said
        to my Skryer: it were good, We had ever some watch-word when we
        should not look for anymore matter at their hands, every time of
        their visiting us.
             Whereupon, (unlooked for of us) he spake again.

        Michael: We lead time, Time leadeth not us.
                                Put up thy pen.
                       The Name of God, be blessed forever.

        Dee - Then they lifted up their hands heavenward (which heaven
        appeared also in the stone) and turned towards us and said:
                                   "Valete".'.
                                 Fare Well.'.

        Dee - So they departed; and at their going, the chair, and the
        Table in the Stone, did seem to shake.

        Dee ---------------- "Soli Deo omnis honor""
                               :Laus et Gloria".'.
                                   "Amen."
                           All Honor Praise and Glory
                               to the One God.
                                   Amen.
                                   .oOo.

            Dei: et ita fortitudo quidem, sed altioris gradus."
            For by Michael is the power shown; Gabriel is the Great Power
        of God, and thus certainly the strength, but of the second rank.

        10 The archangel Michael appeared to him, and gave him a small ring
          having a seal consisting of an engraved stone, and he said to
          him: "Take, O Solomon, king, son of David, the gift which the
          Lord God, the highest Zebaot, hath sent unto thee. With it thou
          shalt lock up all the demons of the earth; male and female, and
          with their help thou shalt build up Jerusalem. But thou must wear
          this seal of God; and this engraving of the seal of the ring is
          Pentalpha." Armed with it Solomon called up all the demons before
          him, and he asked of each in turn his or her name, as well as the
          name of the star or constellation or zodiacal sign and of the
          particular angel to the influence of which each is subject. One
          after another the spirits were vanquished, and compelled by
          Solomon to aid in the construction of the Temple.

          over the Northern; "Nariel", who by some is called "Uriel", is over
          the Southern.'

        19 'Now the Demon of profession is given by the Stars, to which
          such a profession, or sect, which any man hath professed, is
          subjected, which the soul, when it began to make choyce in this
          body, and to take upon it self dispositions, doth secretly
          desire. This Demon is changed, the profession being changed; then
          according to the dignity of the profession, we have Demons of our
          profession more excellent and sublime, which successively take
          care of man, which procures a keeper of profession, as he
          proceeds from vertue to vertue. When therefore a profession
          agrees with our nature there is present with us a Demon of our
          profession like untous, and suitable to our "Genius", and our life
          is made more peaceable, happy, and prosperous: but when we
          undertake a profession unlike, or contrary to our "Genius", our
          life is made laborius, and troubled disagreeing patrons.'

        20 Dee gives this mark:          <5>

 Illustrations are not possible in the electronic edition.)

               Center for Enochian Studies, Volume I, No. 9:

                   "Marty 15 Thursday. Hora 1 1/4 a meridie"#1

             Dee - After Edward Talbot his calling into the stone;
        appeared a tall man, with a sceptre (Very great) of gold
        glittering. His body all red: and out of his head, did shoot out
        beams of light, like the sun beams#2.
             Dee - I being desirous, to know who he was, and his name; I
        requested him earnestly thereto, but he answered as followeth:
             ---: "Invocate nomen Domini agnoscetis eum."
                 'Call in the name of the Lard, You will recognize him.'
             Dee - Then I prayed the Psalm:#3
             "Deus misereatur nostri, et benedicat nobis: illuminet vultum,"
        "suum super nos, et misereatur nostri."
             Vulg. Ps:LXVI:1.
            'May God be gracious and bless us, may he show us a benign
        countenance.'
             Douay:LXVI:1.
            'God be merciful unto us; and cause his face to shine upon us:
        Selah#4.
             A.V:LXVII:1.
             After that, he said:
             ---: I am mighty.
             Dee - Because he delayed to declare his name, Edward Talbot






        the skryer did require him: in the name of God the father, Jesus
        Christ his son#5, and of the holy ghost, to express his name. And he
        answered in speech:
             ---: So I will by and by.
             Dee - Then he seemed to take from his head little bright
        sparks,like little candles' ends; and to stick them about the
        chair#6, and he went round about the chair, and then he spake, as
        followeth:
   i.        ---: I am mighty and working wonders; I am SOLOMON#7. I rule in
        the heavens, and bear sway upon earth; in his name, who be blessed
        forever. Thou doest doubt at me. I am the servant of God, in his
        light; I serve him.  I say, I serve him; with fear and reverence.
        My name is SOLOMON#8: Mighty in the Sun#9, Worker of Worldly actions;
        as well internal, as external. Known unto God; whose name I know,
        and bless forever.
             Dee - Then appeared a big flame of fire by him in the air.
             Solomon: Thou knowest not, or thou wilt not know, that
        Mammon#10, with his servants, are present about thee. Whose presence
        doth hinder the presence of the virtues#11 Adonai overcoming.
        Blessed be God, in the highest. Amen.
             Dee - He took the forsaid flame of fire, and flung it unto
        the heavenward.
   ii.       Solomon: Mammon#12 is a king whom God hateth: whose sect
        continually tempt, provoke, and stir up wickedness against the
        Lord, and against his annointed. But he dies, blessed be God
        forever. Drive him away.
             Dee: It is incomparably more easy for you to do. And as for
        my part I feel neither in body, nor soul; any token of his presence
        or working.
             Thereupon he caused the whole chamber (Which we were in) to
        appear very plainly in the stone#13: and so there shewed a great
        company of Wicked Spirits#14 to be in the chamber; and among them,
        One, most horrible and grisly, threatening, and approaching to our
        heads, and scorning and gnashing at us.
             Solomon: God determines his mysteries, by Art and Virtue.
             Dee - Then he Willed Very eagerly to drive them away. And I
        prayed fervently. And there seemed one to come into the stone,
        which had very long arms; and he drove them away courageously. And
        so they were driven away.
             After that presently, came one into the stone, all white.
        Solomon reached this white one a Cup. The white man held up the
        cup; and said, as followeth:
   iii.      ---: Lo this is my name.
             God shall bless you. Fear not. Your faithfullness provoketh me
        to tell my name, and this it is: (putting forth the Cup again) for
        I am called
                              "Medicina Dei"#15.
                             God his Healing.
        I will shew thee, and I will show you, the Angel of your Direction,
   iv.  Which is called OCH#16.
             Dee - This name he spake, he showed it also on the Table#17
        (before him) written.
             Raphael: He is mighty in the Sun#18 beams, he shall profit
        thee#19 hereafter.
             Dee - Then came in another, and sat down in the chair; and
        he said as followeth:
             ---: The strength of God Liveth, and reigneth forever.
                                    I am
                               "Fortitudo Dei"#20.
                              God his Strength.






             Dee: Why then, you are Gabriel; and I took you but hereto to
        be Michael. Michael; how shall I then amend my book, in respect of
        your name always before written Michael?
             "Fortitudo Dei":  What thou hast Written, That hast thou
        Written; and it is true.
             Write down this name POLIPOS.
             Doth thou understand it?
             Dee:  No, God knoweth.
             "Fortitudo Dei":  When that day cometh, I will speak with thee,
   v.   if thou observe that which I have commanded thee.
             As truly as I was with SOLOMON#21, so truly will I be with
        thee.
             Dee - Then came in another; Whom we take to be Uriel, for he
        went also, as he was want, and leaned at the Table.
            "Fortitudo Dei":  Search for Wisdom and Learning, and the Lord
        Will deliver it unto you.
             Dee:  I would to god.  I knew your name truly, or What
        peculiar Letter I might set for you, to Note your Words and Actions
        by.
             "Fortitudo Dei":  Name I have none, but by my Office.
             SOLOMON came not hither, but by me.
             He is a mighty Prince, governing the heavens, under my power.
             This is sufficient for thy Instruction.
             I was with Solomon, in all his Works and Wonders#22; and so was
        this, Whome God had appointed Unto him.
             The Divines know his name, and he is not hidden from the face
        of the earth. His name is written in the book which Lieth in the
        Window.
   vi.       Dee: Do you mean Agrippa his book?  And it is there
            expressed by the name SOLOMON?#23
             "Fortitudo Dei":  I have said.
             Dee:  What order will you appoint unto us two, in respect of
        our two beings together  My friend here may have other intents and
        purposes of his affairs, than will serve me for his aid having in
        these Actions.
             "Fortitudo Dei": Join in prayers.  For God hath blessed you.
        Doubt not. Consider these Mysteries.
             Dee: Then they in the stone used talk together, but not well
        to be discerned by the ear of Edward Talbot.
             At length "Fortitudo Dei" talked very much, and speedily to
        Edward Talbot and disclosed unto him (Which he expressed not to me,
        at the stone, but disclosed afterward) all the manner of the
        practice, and circumstance about the Action intended, With the Gold
        Lamen, the ring, the seals etc#24. And after I had spoken somewhat;
        in requesting him to shew me the manner, How I should artificially
        prepare everything spoken of he said:
             "Fortitudo Dei":#25 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

                             Dee's Marginalia:

        i. SOLOMON: Of Solomon you may read in the call,
             "Diei Dominica in Elementis Magicis Petri de Abano",
             Of the lord's Day in the Elements of Magick of Peter of Abano
             their called Salamia#26.

        ii. Mammon#27

        iii. Raphael

        iv. "De OCH"#28", vide in libello Arbatel in" Sun






            For OCH, look in the little book, the Arbatel, on the Sun.

        v. Perchance he meaneth the council of Annael: before specified#29.

        vi. It is in "Elementis Magicis Petri de Abano" printed with Clavis

          despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.' Mt.VI:24

          done wisely: for the children of this world are in their
          generation wiser than the children of light.
              And I say unto you. Make to yourselves friends of the mammon
          of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
          everlasting habitations.
              He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also
          in much. and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in
          much.
              If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
          mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
              No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the

          progression of meaning son = Sonne = Sun, wherein though the
          orthography is identical the first and last meanings would not
          normally be considered cognate, and the second citation though
          certainly ambiguous, it is also quite leading. No puns intended.
        19 "Thus Och, the prime of solar things, presides over the
          preparation of gold naturally in the veins of the Earth - that is to
          say, he is the Mineralogist in Chief of Nature; he presides also
          over the quicker preparation of the same metal by means of the
          chemical art - that is, he is the Prince of Alchemists; and,
          finally, he makes gold in a moment by Magick"
              ...,also bestows gold and a purse quaintly described by the
          English translator of the "Arbatel" as "springing with gold." He
          causes the possessor of this charachter to be worshipped as a god
          by the kings of the whole world."

        21 It is interesting to note any survey of medieval grimiores will
          demonstrate the the degree to which this form of magikal literature
          is dependent on the authority and legends of Solomon. Of which
          Mathers' translations of the Greater and Lesser Keys are probably
          the most familiar.
        22 SOLOMON. The historical and mythological aspects of Solomon are
          far too immense to cover in this limited space, but the
          interested will find a considerable begining, if they examine
          those sources cited in our previous articles with attention to
          all Solomonic references.
        23 Dee renders this name throughout as both SALAMAIN and SALOMON.
        24 This information was eventually compiled by Dee into: "Libri"
          "Quinti Appendice" or included in his "Heptarchia Mystica". A
          complete exegesis of the equipment and primary methods of
          practice set forth, in this Dee's "First Book of Mystical"
          "Exercises"; will begin following the conclusion of that book, in
          next month's article.
        25 The remaining portion of "Liber Primus" is fragmentary as noted in
          Ashmole's introduction. The footer of this page indicates by the
          abb. '[F.D.]' that "Fortitudo Dei" is the next speaker, and as the
          material directly following this page is wanting its header it
          is only by surmise that we can draw any conclusions as to what is
          actually missing. As noted above the remaining fragments and
          Ashmole's post script will bring the body of Doctor John Dee's
          "Liber Mysteriorum Primus" to a conclusion in next months Thelema
          Lodge Calender.

          health; he bestoweth great wisdom, giveth the most excellent
          Spirits, teacheth perfect Medicines: he converteth all things
          into most pure gold and precious stones: he giveth gold, and a
          purse springing with gold. He that is dignified with his
          Charachter, he maketh him to be worshipped as a Diety, by the
          Kings of the Whole World."

             "Fortitudo Dei":[#14]  We Live in the Lord, who be praised forever.
             Dee- I stood silent a good while.
             "Fortitudo Dei":  What wilt thou?
             Dee:  I did attend, what you would say.
             "Fortitudo Dei":  I have said.
             Dee:  I have been long at this time, in my dealing with
        you.[#15]  I trust, I do not offend you therewith.  But, for my part,
        I could find in my heart to continue whole days and nights in this
        manner of doing; even till my body should be ready to sink down for
        weariness, before I would give over.  But I fear, I have caused
        weariness to my friend here.
             "Fortitudo Dei":  In virtue is no weariness.
             Dee- Now he stood up out of his chair; and he, and they all
        jointly blessed us, stretching their hands toward us, Crossingly.
        And so they went away.  The Table and the chair remained, and the
        glittering sparkles, or drops of streaming little lights were off
        the chair immediately.
                       Dee- Glory,thanks, and honor
                          be to the Almighty Trinity
                                      Amen.

             The Postscript Of Elias Ashmole

             "Mysteriorum Liber Primus", book ending here (as I conceive)
   ii.  after which follows "Mysteriorum +Liber Secundus", but the beginning
        thereof is utterly perished.[#17]

        ii. +
             So it appears to be by diverse Quotations in the following
        Books.[#18]











        1  This fragment of text is probably the continuation of Dee's
          Action dated March 15 MDLXXXII anno domini; being the conclusion
          to his "Liber Mysteriorvm Primvs", internal evidence indicates the
          close relationship between this leaf and the previously given
          action.
           Approximately 30% of the top of this page was lost to damage
          (cf. "Thelema Lodge O.T.O." (Berkeley CA: Feb.1988 e.v.); the
          placement of 'Sequential periods i.e. ...'    indicates where
          damage either abuts or intrudes into written text.
        2  "Fortitudo Dei aut Michaelem"? op.cit. Mar. 1988 ev.
        3  "Est id 'Misericors'" ? ibid.
        4  "Medicina Dei sive Raphaelem:" ibid.
        5  "Afflicta:" ibid.
        6  "Angeli illis estis toti Mundo praedominantes:"  ibid.
        7  "Angeli cvm Gabrieli sunt:  Prevalescentia sive praepotentia,"
          "sive fortitudo et praevalescens Dei."  Ibid.
        8  "In Caeli." Ibid.
        9  3d Ezra: L. Vulg. Vriel.  Citations in antiq. of the non extant
          Gk. version give [ Upsilon rho iota lambda :
          400 + 200 + 10 + 30 = 640],
          reconstruction from Aramaic fragments and various Gk.
          transliterated Gk. commentaries would give the Heb. as
          [Ayin-Heh-Resh-Yod-Aleph-Lamed : 70 + 5 + 200 + 10 + 1 + 30 = 316]
        10 Serious study should be given II Esdras: III - XIV, if possible
          in the arch. versions, of this most strange scripture (cf. infra
          3d Ezra).
           Special note and meditation should be devoted, by those with wit
          to understand, to those passages which provide practical
          instruction in the sciences of Thaumaturgy, and Theurgy:
           Compare also III: 1-14. with references given to Uriel and Adam
          in the conclusion of Abramelin's Sacred Magick.
        11 The Apocryphal book of II Esdras is a strange compound book from
          a number of original texts with similar origins, but somewhat
          varying chronology, and make up the different books of Ezra (&
          pts of Neh.), Esdras (I & II), 3d Ezra, as well as Visions,
          Testaments, and Apocalypses of Ezra/Esdras etc.
           The original core was apparently Hebrew; and contained primary
          material now completely lost; preceding what is in modern ref. 3d
          Ezra or trad. II Esdras cap. iii.
           The book was then translated into Greek, but both the Gk. and
          Heb. versions are now lost; though Quotations from both, in
          original tongues, do exist from antiquity.
           Some time in the Early Christian Era a new beginning and end in
          Gk. were added for theological reasons of the Ante-Nicene church.
           The text then translated into Latin; was included by Jerome in
          the Vulgate. This is the source for most modern translations,
          though many exist in strange tongues that were obviously drawn
          directly from the earlier Gk. or Heb.
        12 Raphael gives a strange Magical formula: whereby a fish is used
          to manufacture what in hermetic terms would be referred as the
          "svmmon bonvm."  A startlingly similar formula is given in libers:
          CDXV, "Opvs Lvtetianvm", and C, "Agape Azoth."
        13 Undetermined personage? cf. II Esdras ii:39-40; I Enoch lxxi:1;
          Rev. iii:5, vii:13.
        14 Vide # 2; L. "Fortitudo Dei" = Eng. The Strength of God. "Est hic"
          "Michael"?
        15 This note supports the probability that this fragment is the
          continuation of the March 15th Action vide op.cit. "Thelema Lodge",
          Nov.1988ev. & # 1. above.
        16 This marginal notation, which apparently refers to the






          difficulties of Saul Barnabas (ibid: Jun-Aug/88ev.), is
          peculiarly arranged in vertical columns reading from the top of
          the page; and suffered therefore from significant fragmentation.
          Reference notation: i.e. +; indicate that this marginalia may
          refer obliquely to the heading line of surviving text.
        17 "Mysteriorvm Liber Secvndvs" deals with the construction,
          arrangement, and operation of the "Sigilvm Dei AEmeth."
           The beginning pages; of which, follow this text in SL.MS. 3188.
          Several are severely damaged and an unknown number of leaves may
          have been lost irrevocably; yet technical examination shows that
          nothing essential to the Seal itself is missing.
           The next dated entry is March 20, 1582 a.d., but it is preceded
          by a long Action to which the date has been lost.
           That book will appear in this place beginning in March of next
          year.
        18 This concludes the main text of:  "Liber Mysteriorvm Primvs"
                                      or:           Dr. John Dee
                                                   His First Book
                                                         Of
                                                  Mystical Exercises.

              Next month we will present the first of three parts devoted
          to appending the materials covered in "Liber Primvs Mysteriorvm."

Thelema Lodge Calendar/Newsletter for January 1989 e.v.

   Center for Enochian Studies, Volume I, Appendix A.

                     Analytical Contents

     This month the Center for Enochian Studies presents a analysis of the
contents of Doctor John Dee's "Mysteriorum Liber Primus".  The Table of
Contents is adapted and expanded from a partial listing, in an unknown
hand, made toward the end of "Libri Quinti Appendix," and is in substance
what appears under the title "'Index Lib. Primus'" on folio 113 of Sloane
MS.3188.  This has been elaborated, and is followed by the assignment of
pagenation, to the articles which have appeared in our serialization.
Concluding this article is an index to the texts of Ashmole and Dee as they
appear in the given text of SL. MS. 3188.

Thelema Lodge Calendar/Newsletter for February 1989 e.v.

               Center for Enochian Studies, Volume I, appendix i

 (footnotes indicated by [#?].  Some charts and Enochian lettering only 
  available in the printed edition.)

                                 Preface

             This month the Center For Enochian Studies begins a series of
        extracts from Doctor John Dee's "Libri Qvinti Appendice".  These
        articles cover matters discussed and cited in "Liber Mysteriorvm"
        "Primvs"; particularly those that bear directly on the construction
        and use of the magikal paraphernalia described therein.

        ================================================================

        1583. "Aprilis" 28.  Sunday after Dinner about 4 of the Clock[#1].

        Dee - As I and Edward Kelly[#2] had diverse talks and discourses of
        Transposition of Letters[#3]; and I had declared him my rule for to
        know certainly how many ways, any number of Letters (propounded)
        might be transposed or altered in place or order.  Behold suddenly
        appeared the spiritual Creature IL[#4], and said:

        Il:  Here is a goodly disputation of transposition of Letters.
        Choose whether you will dispute with me of Transposition  or I
        shall learn you.

        Dee:  I had rather learn than dispute.  And first I think that
        those letters of our Adamical Alphabet have a due peculiar
        unchangeable proportion of their forms and likewise that their
        order is also Mystical[#5].

        Il:  These letters represent the Creation of Man[#6]: and therefore
i.      they must be in proportion.  They represent the workmanship
        wherewithal the Soul of man was made like unto his Creator[#7].
             But I understand you shall have  a painter shortly.

        Dee:  I pray you.  What painter might best serve for the
        purpose?  Can Master Lyne serve the turn well?

        Il:  Dost thou think that God can be glorified in Hell, or can
        Devils dishonor him?  Can Wickedness of a painter deface the
        Mysteries of God?
             The truth is I am come to advertise you, lest with a small
        Error, you be led far aside.
ii.          Let me see the form of your Table.
        Dee - I shewed him the Characters and Words which were to be
        painted round about in the border of the Table.

        Il:  How do you like those Letters?

        Dee:  I know not well what I may say.  For perhaps that which I
        should like were not to be liked, and contrarywise, what I should
        think well of, might be  nothing worth.

        Il:  Thou sayest well.
             Behold, great is the favor and mercy of God towards those,
        whom he  favoreth.  All things are perfect but only that.  Neither
        was that shewed or delivered by any good and perfect Messenger from
iii.    God.  A wicked power did intrude himself, not only into your
        Society, but also into the Workmanship of God's mysteries[#8].






             Satan[#9] dare presume to speak of the Almighty.  These
        characters are devilish:  and a secret bond of the Devil.
             But, this saith the Lord, I will raise them up, whom he hath
        overthrown:  and blot out his footsteps, where they resist my
        glory.  Neither will I suffer the faithful to be led utterly awry:
        nor finally permit darkness to enhem them forever.  He saith,
iv.     I AM, and they* are most Untrue.  But behold, I have brought thee
        the truth; that the Prince of reason, God of understanding, may be
        apparent in every part of his Celestial monstration[#10].
                  Therefore as thou saidst unto me once,
                     So say I now to thee; Serve god.
v.                 Make a square*, of 6 inches every way.
             The border thereof let it be (here) but half an Inch:  but on
vi.     the Table itself, let it be an Inch broad.

        "Vide post foliam, et etiam in tabula Cordis carnis et cutis nam in"
        "lineo defiendentibus ibidem habet hanc Tabulam hic incipiendo sed"
        "in primo omittendo "L "et acccipiendo" O[#11].

        See page following, and likewise in the tablet of the Heart, flesh
        and skin, for in the defended line itself that table has as its
        beginning the omission of L in the first place and acceptance of
        O[#12].

                         In Fronte Tabulae

                         "A Sinistris "

             Every one of those sides must have 21 Characters[#14].  But,
        First, at every Corner make a great B[#15].
             Prayer is the key all good things:

        Dee - After our prayers made, Edward Kelly had sight (in the
        Stone)[#16] of innumerable Letters: and after a little while, they
        were brought into a lesser square fewer Letters.
             First appeared in the border opposite to our standing places;
        (which I used to call ("in Fronte Tabulae") these Letters[#17]
        following, beginning at the right hand, and proceeding toward the
        left.

        1  MDLXXXIII "anno domini" Sunday April 28th 4 o'clock (notat.
          o'clock is a contraction for the arch. 'of the clock').
             This action occurs in the year following the concluding
          article of "Liber Mysteriorvm Primvs", some material therefore
          makes reference to intermediate events; as the specifics of these
          matters will be taken up in the due course of our chronological
          presentation, some issues will not be dealt with in complete
          detail.  We have inspite of this shortcoming attempted to give






          fairly full citation, both to printed works and related MS.
          entries, where questions of major difficulty arise.

          Weiser, 1970)
        3  It is over this argument even now that disputes of some
          importance exist.  And it is to resolving these questions that
          this exposition of these appendices is directed.  It is
          perversely reassuring that, contemporary to the primary source
          material, these disputes were far from clear.

          Light) whose name is drawn from the lower left hand corner of the
          2nd 49 fold table there given as '21/8.', this table also
          referred to as containing 'The Seven Names of God That not even
          the Angels Know' is used in the composition of the "Sigillvm Dei"
          "AEmeth", wherein the name is also drawn out, being located on the
          upper and innermost heptagon as a ligatured EL.  According to
          Laycock 'il' means thee, or thou (2nd person singular of the
          personal pronoun) in the Angelic tongue.  "The Complete Enochian"

        11  This reference is to the proper plan for the Lamen, soon to be
          discussed of the angels, wherein are the letters the same but the
          arrangement different from those given here for the Holy Table.
        12 The illustration given here for the correct arrangement of the
          characters on the "Tabvla Sancta" is the crux of modern disputes,
          concerning the proper execution of this particular piece of
          furniture. The argument first put forward by R. Turner in his
          edition of "The Heparchia Mystica" is, that the arrangement of the
          given by Dr. Casaubon in his "True & Faithful Relation" is
          apparently in incorrect, as it seems to erroneously reverse the
          arrangement given here.  The interested reader is advised to
          compare both these sources in this rather complex controversy;
          having extensively examined the question, including what I
          believe is all of the pertinent MS., I am of the opinion that the
          original correctness of Meric Casaubon's can be proven to
          reasonable level of  precision and accuracy.  The demonstration
          of this proof requires the completion of this series of appended
          texts to syllogize its evidence, therefore will this resolution
          be given in due course of time.

          Alphabet.  The studious will note that these do not agree
          completely with those traditionally assigned by the Golden Dawn,
          and related systems.
        18 This was originally given as tal and a marginal correction given
          as 'med' forte.  We have adopted Ashmoles inclusion of the

          clarity.

          books related to Dee and Kelly's magikal systems.  The details of
          its operation are given in Dee's "Liber Mysteriorvm Secvndvs"

Thelema Lodge Calendar/Newsletter for March-April 1989 e.v.

               Center for Enochian Studies, Volume I, appendix ii

 (footnotes indicated by [#?].  Enochian lettering only available in the
printed edition.)

        After supper[1], returning to our business; I first doubted of the
        heads of the Letters in the border, to be written, which way they
        ought to be turned, to the Centerward of the Table[2], or from the
        Centerward.

i       IL[3]:  The heads of the letters must be next or toward the center of
        the Square Table or Figure.
             Divide that within, by 12 and 7.[4]

        Dee - I divided it.

        IL[5]:  Grace, mercy and peace be unto the Lively branches of his
        flourishing kingdom.  And strong art thou in thy glory, which dost
        unknit the secret parts of thy Lively Workmanship; and that, before
        the weak understanding of man.
             Herein is thy power and Magnificence opened unto man.  And
        why?  Because thy divinity and secret power is here shut up in

ii               Numero Ternario et Quaternario:  adquiro[6] principium et
                    fundamentum omne huius est tui sanctissimi operis.
                 I count the Third and Fourth; from which I obtain this,
                 the first and fundamental of all your most holy works.[7]

             For, if thou (O God) be wonderful and incomprehensible in
        thine own substance, it must needs follow, that thy works are
        likewise incomprehensible[8].  But Lo, they shall now believe,
        because they see, which heretofore could scarcely believe.  Strong
        is the Influence of thy Super celestial power,[9] and mighty is the
        force of that army,[10] which overcometh all things.  Let all power
        therefore rest in thee:
                                   Amen.[11]
        Dee [12] - The Spiritual Creature seemed to eat fire, like balls of
        fire; having his face towards me, and his back towards Edward
        Kelly.[13]

        IL:[14]  Leave out the Bees[15] of the 7 names of the Seven Kings, and
iii     7 Princes: and place them in a table divided by 12 and 7 : the 7
        Spaces being Uppermost: and therein Write, in the Upper Line, the
        Letters of the King, with the Letters of his Prince following next
        after his name: and so of the six other, and their Princes:  And
        read them on the right hand from the Upper Part to the Lowest, and
        thou shalt find; then, the Composition of this Table.[16]
             Therein they are all Comprehended, Saving Certain Letters,
iv      Which are not to be put in[17] here:[18] By reason that the Kings and
        Princes do spring from God; and not God from the Kings and Princes.
        Which excellency is comprehended, and is also manifest, in that
        Third and Fourth member.[19]
             Round about the sides [of this Square] is every Letter of the
        14 names, of the seven Kings and Princes.
v            Hereafter shall you perceive that the Glory of this Table
        surmounteth the glory of the Sun.
             All things else appertaining unto it, are already prescribed
        by your former instruction.[20]
vi           I have no more to say, but God transpose your minds,[21]
        according to his Own Will[22] and pleasure.
             You talked of Transposition.

        1  Sunday April 28th 1583. 'CES I.i.,' Thelema Lodge (Berkeley CA:
          Feb. 1989)
        2  Ibidem, Aug.88. Feb.89.  This article is the second in a series
          extracted from SL.3188 "libri Qvinti Appendice" explaining the
          details of the "Tabvla Sancta".
        3  Dee's notation to IL as given in the Mystical Heptarchy  (vide
          notat. 5. infra):
             i. IL the first of the 7 Sons of Sons of light.
             ii. IL, the living and "semper" ('always' transl.) adherent to
          King Baligon, and his name is expressed in his character: vide
          Nov.  21 Anno 1582.
             iii. IL or E-L (a ligated E+L).
        4  This statement can only be clearly comprehended by understanding
          the relationship between the mysteries of both the Magikal Square
          here concluding and the central arrangement of the Tabula Sancta
          (ibid. notat. 3).  These kabbalistic formulae are expressed in
          the 1st place whereby the four primary elements are by a units
          increase formed of, the "prima materia" of the alchemists, the
          fundamental trinity (1+3=4).  Therewith by the additive operation
          of arithmetic (3+4) is derived the sum 7, which is the key to the
          arrangements of the planets as known to the ancients.  Further,
          from the multiplicative property of mathematics (3x4) cometh the
          sum 12, by which the constellations of the Zodiac are noted.
          This is elucidated, and should be studied in Dr. John Dee's "Monas
          Heiroglyphica" (op.cit. Thelema Lodge, Mar.89.) in particular
          aphorisms VIII & XVIII.
        5  Here begins a passage extracted by Dee for inclusion in his "De
          Heptarchia Mystica: Collectanarum Lib. primvs," the Grimoire he
          himself composed from the bulk of Angelic Conferences recorded in
          Mysteriorvm Libri Qvinti."
             The interested student is strongly recommended to read this
          document, as it  concerns specifics of this Holy Table, the
          Lamen, and the peculiarities of the various Angelic personages
          variously discussed; without which understanding comprehension of
          the seemingly, at times, contradictory aspects of this system
          will prove impossible.
             Vide: G. James, "The Enochian Evocation Of Dr John Dee"
          (Heptangle, Gillete NJ:1984) pp.33-34, and R. Turner, "The
          Heptarchia Mystica" of John Dee (Aquarian Wellingborough,
          Northamptonshire Eng.:1986) pp.44-45.
        6  SL.MS.3188 gives L.abbr.: " '  o "
                                      a. q






             SL.MS.3677 i.e. Ashmole renders this "'ac quo'".
        7 This passage poses difficult ambiguities of Latin and has been
          variously translated:
             Turner (transl. "...the number three and four, from which is
          beginning and all the foundation of this, your most holy work."
             James "...the third and fourth number; from the first and
          fundamental is of all your holy works."
        8  Almost but not quite. The editors.
        9  'super celestial' L.cognate "svpercoelestial", lit.: above, or
          beyond the heavens, or skies.  Vide Dee, "Propaedeumata
          Aphoristica" (op.cit. Thelema Lodge Feb.89. notat 10.), of which
          the modern interpretation would be astrophysical cosmogenesis.
        10 SL.3188 'arme' arch. Eng. for army (vide OED); here probab. as
          in 'the armies of the Lord' an aspect of Jehovah Zebaoth.
          Erroneously rendered though cognate with 'arm'(cf.OED).
        11 This ends the first passage herein cited in the "Heptarchia
           Mystica".
        12 This paragraph of description is lacking in Dee's "Heptarchia".
        13 'E.K.' SL.3188.
        14 Here begins the second passage cited in "The Heptarchia".
        15 Preferred rendering given in the OED for the pl. of the letter
          B.
        16 Vide Plate II. where these names are set out in comparison
          directionally, and in the Adamical Alphabet.

          which see prepositional usage OED.

          conception see H.P.Lovecraft's "The Thing on the Doorstep," 'The
          Best of H.P.Lovecraft', (Del Rey N.Y. NY:1982).  This entirety of
          this story covers this subject in some depth, but Chapter IV.
          paragraph 21. bears, in an arcanely peculiar manner, on note vide
          post.
        22 "Vide Pater Noster" Matt. VI:9-13 = Gk. Theta-eta-lambda-epsilon-

          Aug. & Sept. 89.)
        24 Reading from right to left and top to bottom cf. Plates I. & II.
        25 It is interesting to note here that by the use of the stone
          attributed to King Baligon (op.cit. notat 3.), optically applied
          to the Magick Squares herein referred to, this perplexing issue
          of transposition becomes somewhat more crystal clear.

     Center for Enochian Studies, Volume I, appendix iia

               Prefatio 

     This month The Center For Enochian Studies presents a compilation of the
various tables of magical squares that bear directly upon the construction of
the Holy Table and its relationship to the Sacred Lamen.  It is our hope that
by placing these varied diagrams in comparison to each other, that the reader
will find the explanations; both those that have preceded, and those several
remaining to follow, more lucid.  The Student may thereby find fewer
difficulties in unraveling the variety of complexities and controversies
involved.  These tables are presented, as far as is known, for the first time
anywhere as the angels instructed, id est,  in both the Angelic alphabet and
in Roman characters (true for the printed edition only --- unless you contact
Bill Heidrick for the graphic symbols and alphabet tables that are used to
print from XYWrite on IBM.  Dave Jones is the editor of the Enochiana section
of the TLC).

(In this electronic edition, the footnotes are marked by: [#]


                         "Aprilis 29."  Monday; "a meridie".[#1]

        Dee - As Edward Kelly[#2] and I were talking of my book Soyga;[#3]  or
 i      Aldaraia:  and I at length said that, (as far as I did remember)
 ii     Zadzaczadlin, was Adam by the Alphabet thereof, suddenly appeared
        the spiritual creature, which said yesterday that he would come
        again, this day, uncalled:  and at his first coming he said:  Then,
                                   "a' primo".
                                    Firstly.

        Dee:              "Qui primus est et novissimus,"
                        "Alpha et Omega, misereatur nostri."
                          Who is the first and the last,
                     The Alpha and the Omega, Our commiserator.
        Il:  Amen.  Glory be to thee, Which art one, and comprehending all.
        Marvelous is thy wisdom, in those, of whom, thou wilt be
        comprehended.
             A short prayer, but appliable to my purpose.
             Every praise with us is a prayer.

 iii    Dee - He taketh off his pied coat,[#4] and threw it upon the corner
        of my desk, and then he seemed clothed in an ancient doctorly
        apparel:  and on his head he had a wreath of white silk of three
        braids.

        Il:  Well, I will give you my Lesson, and so bid you farewell.
             First, I am to persuade you to put away wavering minds.
             Secondly, for your instruction in those necessary occasions,
        thus it is:
 iv           The Outside or Skin must be the Center.
              There is one foundation.
              The Flesh must be the Outside.
              The Center itself must be dissevered into 4 equal parts.
             There is your Lesson.
        Dee:  We understand not this dark Lesson.
        Il:  The heart must be the fourth part of the body; and yet the
        body perfect and sound.  The Skin must occupy the place of the
        heart and yet without deformity.
             God is the beginning of all things:  The farthest part of all
        things, is in the hands of God.
 v           The like shall be found amongst the number of his One most
        holy name.
             The Earth is a foundation to every thing:  and differeth but
        only in form.  In the form of his own application whereunto it is
        applied.
             God is the beginning of all things, but not after one sort,
        nor to everyone alike.
             But it is three manner of Works, with his name.
 vi           The One in respect of his Dignification:
              The Second in respect of Conciliation:
              The Third, in respect of an end and determined Operation.
             Now Sir, to what end, would you wear your Character?

        Dee:  At our two first dealings together,[#5] it was answered, by a
        Spiritual Creature (Whom we took to be Uriel.)
 vii               Plate I.
                                      "Sigillum hoc in auro sculpendum,"
                                      "ad defensionem corporis"
                                      "omni loco, tempore et occasione,"
         (this plate may be           "et in pectus gestandum."
          seen in the printed
          edition)
                                      This Seal is to be carved in gold.
                                      as a defense for the body in
                                      all places, times & circumstances,
                                      and is to be worn on the breast.

        Il:  But how do I teach?
             The Character is an Instrument, applicable only to
        Dignification.
 viii        But there is no Dignification (here) but that which doth
        proceed, and hath his perfect Composition, Centrally in the square
        Number of 3 and 4.
             The Center Whereof shall be equal to the greatest.

        Dee:  We understand not.

        Il:  Hereby you may gather, not only, to what end, the blessed
 ix     Character (wherewith thou shalt be dignified) is prepared, but also
        the nature of all other Characters.  To the second ----
        Dee:  Conciliation you mean.
 x      Il:  The Table is an Instrument of Conciliation.
             And so are the other 7 Characters:  which you call by the name
        of Tables, squared out into the form of Armies: which are
 xi     proper to every King and Prince according to their order:
             Now to the last:

        Dee:  As concerning the end and determined Operation.

        Il:  It only consisteth in the mercy of God, and the Character of
 xii    these books.
             For Behold, As there is nothing that cometh or springeth from
        God, but it is as God, and hath Secret Majestical; and inexplicable
 xiii   Operation in it:  So every Letter here bringeth forth the Names of
        God:  But (indeed), they are but One Name:  But according to the
        Local and former being, to (do) comprehend the universal
 xiv    generation, corruptible and incorruptible of every thing.[#6]  It
        followeth then, it must needs comprehend the end of all things.
 xv          This much hitherto.  The Character is false and devilish.  He
        that dwelleth in thee, hath told thee so, Long ago.  The former
        Devil, did not only insinuate himself, but these things.

        Dee:  I do marvel, that we had no warning hereof, ere now; and
        that I was often times called on, to prepare those things
        (Characters and Tables) and yet they were false.

 xvi    Il:  If it should have been gone about to be made, it should not
        have been suffered to pass under the form of Wickedness.
             The Truth is to be gathered upon the first Demonstration.
 xvii        (my Demonstration and* yours are not all one:  you will not be
        offended with me; Sir.)
             I gave thee a certain principle, Which in itself is a
        sufficient demonstration:  I told thee the placing of the Centre,
        the form of it, with a lineal placing and ordering of that
 xviii  which thou lookest* for.

        Dee:  But truly I understand not.
        Il:  I teach.
             Take clean Paper.  It must be made 4 Inches square:
             Pray.

        Dee - We prayed.

        Il:  These Letters, which I shall speak now, thou shalt afterword,
 xix    put them in their proper Characters.
             Write:  Never since the beginning of the World, was this
        Secret delivered; nor this holy mystery set open, before the
        Weaklings of this World.
             Write in the uppermost prick O, and b on the right hand, and g
        on the left, etc.
             The two extreme pricks; one on the right hand, a and the other
        on the left o etc.
             There is the whole.

        Dee - We prayed (unbidden) in respect of the mystery revealed.
        Edward Kelly was scarce able to abide or endure the Voice of the
        Spiritual Creature, when he spake of these things now:  the sound
        was so forcible to his head; that it made it ache vehemently.

          this Mysterious text see our notes vide 'Thelema Lodge', July
          1988ev footnotes 6 & 7 and the text.
        4  "Pied Coat" of mixed colours, sometimes patches as in the 'Pied
          Piper'.
        5  op.cit. Thelema Lodge 7/89ev.
        6  "But according to the Local and former being" would seem to be a
          direct reference to pre-christian Pagan god forms "to comprehend
          the Universal Generation, corruptible and incorruptible of
          everything" would support the essentially sexual and generative
          nature of nearly all pre-christian theology; compare Aleister
          Crowley 'De Natvra Deorvm' (Book 28) caps. I.-IV. where this
          mystery is set forth in a rather straightforward manner.
        7  The enigma of this lesson is related to two similar tables and
          their interrelation to one another; these being the Holy Table
          (vide 'Thelema Lodge' Aug. & Sept. 1988ev) and the Lamen
          (discussed herein).
             By placing a crystal ball as instructed on the previously
          mentioned Table of Practice the exact conditions described here
          in are met; i.e. "The outside or skin" is "the Center", and "the
          center itself" is "dissevered in to 4 equal parts".  Only visual
          experiment on the part of the reader can possibly demonstrate
          this fully, and those interested are recommended to use Casaubons
          'A True and Faithful Relation7, as it affords a size suitable for
          such tests.
             As there are a number of further mysteries herein given that
          this simple optical demonstration will resolve; including the
          erroneously set forth dilemmas of R. Turner, and details
          regarding the construction of the Lamen, both herein and still to
          be set forth in subsequent 'Actions', we shall now conclude this
          rather lengthy note.
        8  "The Seven Tables of Creation" are discussed in Dee's 'Liber
          Mysteriorum Tertius' and may be seen in previously mentioned
          representation of the Holy Table in Casaubon.
             "The Seven Kings & Princes" are taken from 'Liber Mysteriorum
          Tertius' and discussed at depth in our previously cited 'De
          Heptarchia Mystica'.
        9  'The Book of 49 Tables' is commonly referred to as 'Liber
          Logaeth'; it is a singularly peculiar book, and directly follows
          these Five Books of Mystery in sequence and preceding those texts
          presented in 'A True and Faithful Relation'.

             Dee: Belmagel his counterfeiting of our instruction received
        from God, and to Edward Kelly his hands as likely as could be.

             Herein I have followed the Character exactly; by which it
        appears, that the Book of Enoch[#2]. in Sir John Cotton's Library+,
        was written by Edward Kelly's hand.  The Characters in that, being
        made after the fashion of these. [#3]

             + Now "MS. Sloane 3189."  F.M. [#4]

                                   NOTE [#5]

             After that these things were finished, Edward Kelly rose up
        from the Table, and went to the west windows to read a Letter which
        was even then brought him, from his wife:  which being done, he
        took a little Prayer* Book (in english meter made by one William
        Hunnis which Mr. Adrian Gilbert[#6] had left[#7] here, and it lay on
        the Table by us all the while of this first action) and with this Book
        he went into his bed chamber intending to pray on it a certain
        Prayer which he liked; and as he opened the Book his eye espied
        Strange Writing in the spare white paper at the book's end.  And
        beholding it, judged it verily to be his own Letters, and the thing
        of his own doing; but being assured that he never saw the like of
        this Character [for Conciliation] and that other, notified by the
        Heart or Center Skin and Flesh[#8] before this present hour, he became
        astonished, and in great wrath; and behold suddenly  One appeared
        to him and said:
           "Lo this is as good as the other;" meaning that which we had
        received, and is here before set down on the former page.[#9]
           With this news came Edward Kelly to me, and I was writing down
        fair this last Action, and said:
          "I have strange matter to impart unto you."
           Then said I; "What is that?", and at the first (being yet tossed
        in his mind, with this great injury of this subtle supplanter of
        man, ambitiously intruding himself to rob God of his glory) he
        said:  "you shall know," and at length shewed me this little paper
        here by, being the one of the white leaves in the end of the
        foresaid little prayer book.
           And I, viewing it, found it to be meant to be the Counterfeit of
        ours; but with all imperfect diverse ways, after the order of our
        method; yea though the words, out of which it had sprung, had been
        good and sufficient: and there at laughed at, and derided the
        Wicked enemy for his envy, his ass-headed foolish ambition, and
        indeed mere blindness to do anything well.
            To Conclude, we found that with an incredible speed this
        Devilish figure was written down by some Wicked Spirit, to bring
        our perfect doings in doubt with us; to utter undue speeches of
        god's good Creatures, or to wavering minds of the worthiness and
        goodness of the same things received, and so either to leave off,
        or with faint hearted wavering to proceed.
           But I by God's grace, (contrary to such inconveniency) was armed
        with constancy, and confident good hope, that God would not suffer
        me (putting my trust in his goodness and mercy, to receive wisdom
        from him) to be so Unjustly dealt withal, or Unkindly or Unfatherly
        used at his hands etc., and intended after supper to make my
        earnest complaint to the divine Majesty against this Wicked
        intrusion and temptation of Illuding Devil, and so we went to
        Supper.

     *  The title of the Book was: 'Seven Sobs of an sorrowful Soul for sin.'

             1583.  "Aprilis" 29.   Monday, after supper:  "hora" 8a.[#1]
  i.         Dee -  I went into my Oratory[#2], and made a fervent prayer
        against the Spiritual enemy: specially meaning the wicked one who
        had so suddenly, so subtilty, and so lively counterfeited the hand
        and letters of Edward Kelly[#3] as is here before declared[#4]; and by
        the thing itself may appear here.  Likewise Edward Kelly on his
  ii.   knees (at the green chair standing before the chimney) did pray:
        after which prayers ended; [#5] yea, rather, before they were ended,
        on my behalf, Edward Kelly espied a spiritual creature; come to my
        Table:  Whom he took to be IL[#6]., and so, aloud, said.  "He is
        here."  and thereupon I came to my desk, to Write as occasion
        should serve:[#7]  And before I began to do anything I rehearsed part
        of my intent, uttered to god by prayer, and half turned my speech
        to God himself, as the cause did seem to require.  Thereupon that
        Spiritual Creature.  Who as yet had said nothing, suddenly used
        these words: _____ "I give place to my better."
             Edward Kelly: There seemeth to me Uriel[#8] to be come, and IL to

            :  Then began that new come Creature to say thus:
            : Uriel:
            :  Most abundant and plentiful are the great mercies of God
            :  unto them which truly and unfeignedly fear, honor and be-
            :  lieve him.  The Lord hath heard thy prayers and, I am

            :  Which shall from henceforth visit you.

             If I had not made this action perfect (saith the Lord) and
        wrought some perfection in you, to the end you might perform; yea,
        if I had not had mercies (saith the Lord) over the infinite number
  iv.   and multitude of Souls, which are yet to put on the vileness and
        corruption of the flesh.  Or if it were not time to look down, and
        behold the sorrow of my Temple.  Yet would I, for my promise sake,
        and the establishing of my kingdom, Verify my mercies upon the sons
  v.    of men.  Whereunto I have Chosen three of you, as the mouths and
        Instruments of my determined purpose[#9].  Therefore (sayeth the
  vi.   Lord), Be of stout and courageous mind in me, for me, and for my
        truth sake.  And Fear not the assaults of temptation, For I have
        said:  "I am with you."  But as mercy is necessary for those that
  vii.  repent, and faithfully forget their offenses.  So is Temptation
        requisite and must ordinarily follow those, whom it pleaseth him to
        illuminate with the beams of triumphant Sanctification.  If
        Temptations were not, how should the Sons of men (sayeth the Lord)
        know me to be merciful?  But I am honored in hell, and worshipped
        with the blasphemers:
                       "Pugna erit, vobis autem victoria"
             Even the victory was thine, of the Battle which was.
             Yet, albeit, (thus sayeth my message) I will defend you from
        the cruelty of these days to come and will make you perfect:
  viii. that perfectly you may begin in the works of my perfection:  But
        What?  and dost thou (Satan)[#10] think to triumph?  Behold (sayeth
        the God of Justice) I will banish thy servants from this place and
        region, and will set stumbling blocks before the feet of thy
        ministers.  Therefore, be it unto thee, as thou hast deserved.  And
        be it to this people, and holy place, (as it is, the Will of God;
  ix.   Which I do pronounce) light without darkness. Truth without
        falsehood, righteousness without the works of wickedness.  I have
        pronounced it, and it is done.
  x.         But thou, o youngling* (but old sinner), Why dost thou suffer
        thy blindness thus to increase; or why dost thou not yield thy
        Limbs[#11] to the service and fulfilling of an eternal verity?  Pluck
        up thy heart.  Let it not be hardened.  Follow the way that leadeth
        to the knowledge of the end; the open sight of god his word
        Verified, for his kingdoms sake.
             You began in Tables[#12], and that of small account.  But be
        faithful;  for you shall be written within Tables of perfect and
        everlasting remembrance.  Considering the truth; Which is the
        message of him Which is the fountain and Life of the true, perfect,
        and most glorious life to come:  Follow, Love, and diligently
        Contemplate the mysteries therein.
             He that hath done this evil, hath not only sinned against
        thee, but against God, and against his truth.  Judgment is not of
        me, and therefore I can not pronounce it:  But What his Judgment
        is, he knoweth in himself.  His name is
  xi.                            BELMAGEL[#13]
                                 legamleb
  xii.  and he is the firebrand[#14], which hath followed thy soul from the
        beginning:  yea seeking his destruction, who can better
        counterfeit, than he, that in thy wickedness is chief Lord and
        Master[#15] of thy Spirits; or who hath been acquainted with the
        secrets of man's fingers, so much as he that hath been a director?
  xiii. My sayings are no accusation, neither is it my property to be
        defiled with such profession[#16].  But I counsel you generally; and
        advertise you through the grace, and by the spirit of unspeakable
        mercy.
  xiv.       This night, if your prayers had not been; yea if they had not
        pierced into the seat of him which sitteth above:  Thou, yea (I
        say) thou hadst been carried, and taken away, this night, into a
        wilderness, so far distant hence Northward[#17], that thy destruction
        had followed.
             Therefore Lay away thy Works of youth; and fly from fleshly
        Vanities, if not upon Joy and pleasure of this presence, yet for
        the glory of him that hath chosen you.
               .-
               : I say, be strong.  Be Humble with Obedience:
  xv.          : For All the things, that have been spoken of,
               : shall come to pass. And there shall not a
               : letter of the book of this prophesy perish.
               .-
             Finally, God hath blessed you:  and will keep you from
  xvi.  temptation,Dee and will be merciful unto you, and perfect you;
        for
  xvii. the dignity of your profession*  sake.
             Which, World Without end, forever and ever; With us and all
  xviii.creatures, and in the light of his own countenance, be honored.

        Dee -  Hereupon I made most humble prayer with hearty thanks to
        our God, for his help, comfort, and judgment against our enemy, in
        this case (so greatly concerning his glory).  And at my standing
        up, I understood that Uriel was out of sight to Edward Kelly Yet I
        held on my purpose to thank him, and to praise god for Uriel that
        his so faithful. ministry unto his divine Majesty, executed to
        our needful comfort in so vehement a temptation.

          their ingenium discover in these pages the most sublime mystery
          that, A. Crowley puts forth in his "Confessions", is herein
          concealed.  Once unveiled the mage is able to locate and exploit the
          control vector connecting the so called `evil' daemonic with the
          'good' angelic systems; and resolve the paradoxical mystery
          concerning why legend has it that the Demons built Solomon's Temple,
          and that the Angelic Hosts have from Sodom to the "Apocalypse" been
          associated with one continuous chain of the most gruesomely
          destructive acts of violence that the mind of man has ever
          conceived.
            Enochian scholars will note the marked similarity to the

          ENGLISH LANGUAGE".
        [#14] The actual grammar; including the syllogisms derived from the
          use of its theorems are, in fact, upon close critical analysis,
          somewhat less than ambiguous and will yield, even through limited
          Socratic dialectic to the complicity of the spirits involved.
          Either "Belmagel" (and prob. "Lundrumguffa"* before him) are agents
          of "Uriel" (Chaldee > Heb. Angel of Light) masquerading as daemons
          to act as gods accuser and enforcer, Or "Lucifer" (IndoAryan >
          Latin:  The Agency of Lumination) and his fallen Angels are
          posing as Angels to instigate their coming insurrection against

          (cf. Pike & M.P. Hall et al) these grips and signals used by
          secret orders of Alchemists  etc. were used for recognition and

                  THE CALL OR KEY OF THE THIRTY AETHYRS

        O Ye Heavens which dwell in the first Aire3, ye are mighty in the
   parts of the Earth, and execute therein the Judgment of the Highest! Unto
   you it is said:  Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort,
   whose eyes ate the brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the
   Government of the Earth, and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with
   the power of understanding to dispose of all things according to the
   Foresight of Him that Sitteth on the Holy Throne4, and rose up in the
   Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be governed by her parts, and let
   there be Division in her, that the glory of her may be always ecstasy and
   imitation of orgasm.  Her course, let it run with the Heavens; and as an
   handmaid let her serve them.  One season, let it confound another, and let
   there be no creature upon or within her the same.  All her members, let
   them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one Creature equal
   with another.  The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them
   vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them forget
   their Names.  The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced.  His
   building, let it be a Cave for the Beast of the Field!  Confound her
   understanding with darkness!  For why?  It repenteth me concerning the



   Virgin and the Man.  One while let her be known, and another while a
   stranger:  because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of
   him that is fallen.
        O ye Heavens arise!  The lower heavens beneath you, let them serve
   you!  Govern those that govern!  Cast down such as fall.  Bring forth with
   those that increase, and destroy the rotten.  No place let it remain in
   one number.  Add an diminish until the stars be numbered. Arise!  Move!
   and appear before the Covenant of His mouth, which He hath sworn unto us
   in His Justice.  Open the Mysteries of your Creation, and make us
   partakers of THE UNDEFILED KNOWLEDGE.

                            Postscript

        As an epilogue to this first of two installments, our readers should
   know that the CES itself was heavily disrupted in the, by now infamous,
   Thelema Lodge raid.  The library facility which serves as our base was
   ransacked by police in a futile attempt to discover nonexistent evidence
   of felonious activities.  Valuable books, files, and manuscript copy was
   thrown in a great heap on the floor and even as I write this morass has
   yet to be fully sorted out.  Several members of our research staff were
   among those arrested and held on completely bogus charges.  I am reminded
   of the treatment received by both Dee and Kelly at various times in their
   lives, and the destruction and looting of a great portion of Dee's library
   at Mortlake for frighteningly similar reasons.
         These and other circumstances have led to the temporary suspension
   of our manuscript transcription.  The center itself is moving to a larger
   room which we hope will facilitate better research in the future, but will
   incur some temporary inconveniences and increased cost.  To help in this
   and other efforts at Thelema Lodge we are offering a limited issue
   facsimile (156 stamped and numbered copies) of the Barstow edition Vision
   and Voice.  These will sell for $30.00 each and be spiral bound as was the
   original.  Checks made out to CASH should be sent with your requests c/o
   Thelema Lodge at the Berkeley P.O. box number found elsewhere in this
   publication.  We thank all our supporters and hope to resume normal
   transmissions by the beginning of the new vulgar year.
