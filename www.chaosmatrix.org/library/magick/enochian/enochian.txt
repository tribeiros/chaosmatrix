                          ENOCHIAN NUMBERS
                       EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK
             "THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC"

Having associated myself with Israel Regardie's call for greater
openness with occult teaching material, I now wish to share with
readers of this book some of my results of my own research. The
quotation from John Dees spiritual diaries with which I headed up
this paper was written at the time the Angelic Keys were being
dictated. Closely read and taken in context, it suggests not only
that the keys may involve more than one numbering system, but also
that 'the letters' i.e., the characters of the Enochian alphabet,
may be 'in confusion' in the sense that the traditional order may
not be correct. Much more plainly in part three of 'The concourse
of the forces' MacGregor Mathers states: "The numbers such as 456
and 6739, etc. which occur in some of the calls contain mysteries
not here to be explained."
Following these and similiar hints throughout Dee's diaries, as
well as some of the manuscript books discussed above, I have been
able to establish three conclusions with a rather high degree of
rigour: first, that there are in fact two numbering systems in
Enochian, of which one is used for gematria and the other only for
translating numbers into single digits; second, that the correct
order of characters in the Enochian alphabet resembles that in
Greek and Coptic; and, third, that the Gematric code (as I propose
to call it) follows a pattern rather more like Hebrew. Since this
is not the place to recapitulate my reasoning, I will say only
that after checking it several times and having it checked for me
on an IBM 370 using a program written in LISP  I think it is
right. Here are my results.

CHARACTER              GEMATRIC CODE            DIGITAL CODE

   E                     5                             5

   K                     20                            2
   L                     30                            3

   X                     60                            6
   O                     70                            7
   P                     80                            8
   Q                     90                            9
   R                    100                            1
   S                    200                            2
   T                    300                            3
   U                    400                            4

The next step of course is to follow Mathers lead, enter the
Angelic Keys with the digital code, and translate the numbers into
their correct values. Here is the result.

The seven letters with asterisks are the only ones for which
correct values were given in the text and were presumably left
there to serve as clues of a sort. Very Helpful.
