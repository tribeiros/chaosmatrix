  The ritual does not give any intonations, and I suspect that none are 
required, since the first two deal with the Elemental Fire and Water, out
of their ordinary quarters. Here is a quick and dirty translate of the 
two that are used. I feel they refer to the male and female participants:

EAST:

     MYKMAH A-YAL PRG DE VAOAN, AR QUASB TYBYBF, DOALYM OD TELOKH

Behold, the fire of first glory of truth, that destroy sorrow, sin and death.


SOUTH:

     MIKMAH, VLS DE AGEOBOFAL Y DLUGA TOGLO PUGO A TALHO

Behold, end of -------- is given all unto the cup.
