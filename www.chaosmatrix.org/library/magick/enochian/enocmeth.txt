                   On Methods Vsed to Deriue Certayne Divers
                        Names from the Enochian Tablets


      In the Enochian 'system' there are four elemental tablets and another
   one corresponding to Spirit (called the Tablet of Union).
      The elemental tablets are 12 squares wide and 13 squares deep (156
   squares per tablet),  except for the Spirit Tablet, which is 5x4.  In
   each square is a letter that Dee and Kelley received by Actions or
   workings, with certain angels recorded elswhere.  By methods contained
   herein, names can be drawn out which consist of the Enochian Hierarchy.
      The Tablets being used are the April 20th, 1587 revision by Raphael,
   called the "Tabula Recensa."


   I.  Tablet of UNION

      1.  The Tablet of Union is a square composed of 20 squares, being 5
   squares wide, and 4 squares deep.  By reading the files (top to bottom)
   or lines (left to right) we derive certain names.
      2.  The whole tablet itself is attributed to Spirit while different
   files and lines are attributed to the elements as such:

                             Spirit   Air   Water  Earth  Fire
                                :      :      :      :      :
                                :      :      :      :      :
                                v      v      v      v      v

                    Air  --->   E      X      A      R      P

                  Water  --->   H      C      O      M      A

                  Earth  --->   N      A      N      T      A

                   Fire  --->   B      I      T      O      M

      3.  Using this method, we can see that the name EHNB consists of all
   the elements but is attributed to Spirit.  EXARP is also all the
   elements, but attributed to Air, etc.
      4.  What are generally referred to as the Spirit names are: EXARP,
   HCOMA, NANTA, and BITOM, read from the 1st - 4th line, left to right.
      5.  EXARP governs the Air Tablet; HCOMA the Water Tablet; NANTA the
   Earth Tablet; and BITOM the Fire Tablet.


   II.  The Elemental Tablets

      1.  As stated before, the four elemental tablets are ruled 12x13 each,
   156 squares per tablet total.  Each tablet is attributed to one of the
   four elements: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire.
      2.  Additionally, each tablet has four subquadrants.  They are 5x6
   squares each and positioned in each corner of the tablet in question.
   They are also attributed to the four elements in a like manner of the
   tablets.
      3.  For example, on the Air tablet, you will have an Air subquadrant
   corresponding to Air of Air; a water subquadrant corresponding to Water
   of Air; a earth subquadrant for Earth of Air; and a Fire subquandrant for
   Fire of Air.
      4.  Each subquadrant contains a Calvary Cross which is the 3rd Column
   and 2nd Line of the subquadrant.  It contains the God-Names of the
   subquadrant.  The squares af the Cross are referred to as the Sephirotic
   Squares.
      5.  The first line of a subquadrant (excepting the 3rd column) is
   called the Kerubic Squares.
      6.  Lines of a subquadrant 3-6 (excepting Col. 3) are called the
   Servient Squares.
      7.  With the subquadrant of the tablet ruled out, this leaves a cross
   in the center of the tablet.  The cross is attributed to the mystical
   element of Spirit and contains the names of the God-name of the Tablet,
   the King, and the 6 Seniors.
      8.  The 7th Line of the tablet is called the Line of the Holy Spirit
   or Linea Spiritus Sancti.
      9.  The 6th Column of the tablet is called the Line of the Father or
   Linea Patris.
      10.  The 7th Column of the tablet is called the Line of the Son or
   Linea Filii.
      11.  When the four tablets are placed together as the Watchtowers, the
      cross dividing the tablets is called the Black Cross and is attributed
      to Spirit (Tablet of Union).
      12.  The Four Great Watchtowers of the Universe

   III.  The Secret Holy Names of God

      1.  The God-name of the tablet is found on the Linea Spiritus Sancti.
      2.  The name is divided into three names.  One is 3 letters, one 4
   letters, and one 5 letters.  Hence this is also called the 3,4,5 Name.
      3.  Using the Air Tablet we get the name ORO,IBAH,AOZPI.  For the
   Water Tablet MPH,ARSL,GAIOL.  For Earth MOR,DIAL,HCTGA.  And for Fire
   OIP,TEAA,PDOCE.


   IV.  The Great Kings (or Whirls)

      1.  Next in the Hierarchy are the Kings of the Tablets.  Their names
   are gotten from the center of each elemental tablet and read in a spiral.
      2.  Example:  The King of Air is BATAIVAH

       Line 6 --->    f   m   o   n   d  /A---T\  d   i   a   r   i
                                        /       \
       Line 7 --->    o   r   o   i   B   A-->H   A   o   z   p   i
                                          :     /
       Line 8 --->    t   n   a   b   r   V---I/  x   g   a   s   d

      3.  The King of Water is RAAGIOSL, King of Earth is ICZHIHAL, and the
   King of Fire is EDLPRNAA.


   V.  The Seniors

      1.  There are Six Seniors per tablet and twenty-four in all.  They are
   all planetary in nature excepting the Sun, which is attributed to the
   King.
      2.  The Names are derived from the Linea Spiritus Sancti (Linea S.S.),
   the Linea Patris, and the Linea Filii.  These names are 7 letters long.
      3.  They are read outward from the center starting at:

      Col. 6, Line 7, left to right;       Col. 7, Line 7, right to left;
      Col. 7, Line 7, bottom to top;       Col. 6, line 7, bottom to top;
      Col. 7, line 7, top to bottom;       Col. 6, line 7, top to bottom.

      4.  Example:  Air Tablet Seniors -

                               Col. 6     Col. 7
                                     \   /

                                     R   A



   VI.  The Calvary Cross God-names

      1.  These God-names are derived from the Calvary Crosses in each
   elemental sub-quadrant of the elemental tablets.
      2.  The 6-lettered God-name (read top to bottom) on the vertical
   portion of the cross is used to call forth the Servient Angels.  The
   5-lettered God-name (read left to right) on the horizontal portion is
   used to  control them.
      3.  Example of the Calvary Cross God-names in the Air subquadrant of
   the Air Tablet (air/AIR):

                              r    z    I    l    a
                                         \
                              A    R    D :  Z    A
                               \----------:------>
                              c    z    O :  n    s
                                          :
                              t    o    I :  t    t
                                          :
                              s    i    G :  a    s
                                          v
                              f    m    O    n    d

      From this we derive the names:  IDOIGO and ARDZA.


   VII.  The Kerubic Angels

      1.  The Kerubic angels are obtained from the 1st line of a subquadrant
      (except the 3rd column, which is part of the Calvary Cross), from
      reading left to right.
      2.  This Kerub also has companions derived from its name by reading
      left to right, starting from the next letter to the right.
      3.  Example in air of Air:  RZLA with companions ZLAR, LARZ, and ARZL
      Example in fire of Air:  XGSD with companions GSDX, SDXG, and DXGS
      4.  In addition, a ruling Kerubic Archangel can be obtained by taking
      the appropriate Tablet of Union letter from the Black Cross and
      placing it before the name of the Kerubic angel.
      5.  Example in air of Air:  ERZLA rules RZLA, ZLAR, LARZ, and ARZL.
      Example in fire of Air:  HXGSD rules XGSD, GSDX, SDXG, and DXGS.


   VIII.  The Servient Angels

      1.  The Servient Angels are found in the 3rd through 6th lines of a
      subquadrant by reading left to right; again, except for the 3rd
      column.
      2.  They are called forth by the vertical Calvary Cross God-name, and
      controlled by the horizontal Calvary Cross God-name.
      3.  As the Kerubic Angels, they too have companions which are obtained
      from their names by reading left to right, starting from the next
      letter to the right.  This makes a total of sixteen Servient Angels
      per  subquadrant.
      4.  Example in air of Air:
                 CZNS with companions ZNSC, NSCZ, and SCZN
                 TOTT with companions OTTT, TTTO, and TTOT
                 SIAS with companions IASS, ASSI, and SSIA
                 FMND with companions MNDF, NDFM, and DFMN


   IX.  The Cacodaemons

      1.  The Cacodaemons (elementals) or 'evil' influences are obtained by
      adding the appropriate letter from the Black Cross and putting it
      before the first two letters of the Servient Squares.
      2.  Example in air of Air:  XCZ, ATO, RSI, and PFM
      3.  These are ruled by the reversed Calvary Cross God-names.  The
      reversed 6-lettered name calls them forth, and the reversed 5-lettered
      name controls them.
      4.  Example in earth of AIR:  IAOAIA calls forth CAB, ONA, MOC and ASH
                                    TIIIO controls them.

  NOTE:  I used Dee's methods to obtain the names of the Enochian Hierarchy
  present in the Tabula Recensa (1587 reformed tablets).  The Golden Dawn
  methods that are used seemed to have been pulled out of a hat so to speak.
