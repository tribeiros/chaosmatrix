For a hundred years students of esoteric lore
have struggled to fathom the writings of Arthur
Edward Waite. Many have given up all hope of
understanding these "Waitey Tomes" because
they can't figure out what he is trying to say or
even why he is trying to say it. I recall a similar
feeling after reading four pages on Knorr von
Rosenroth in Waite's THE HOLY KABBALAH
which contained absolutely no information on
von Rosenroth or his writings!<P>

      However, there is a simple explanation for
all this confusion: Arthur Edward Waite was NOT
writing in English! The language he used appears
to be English to the untrained eye but actually it
is an obscure dialect known to philologists and
antiquarians as "West Anglican Curmudegon"
(W.A.C.). This patois uses a modified English
vocabulary restricted to words of no less than five
sylables and follows a rigid rule that no statement
can be made without a descriptive clause added to
qualify and further define each noun and verb employed
in ALL its possible ramifications. Punctuatuion is
expanded to accomodate this requirement. This
grammatical structure is difficult to follow until one
realizes that Ciceroian Latin construction is being
used in place of English sentance structure. (Latin
students will recall that Cicero was the inventor of
the run-on sentance.)<P>

       As a useful illustration I will translate a simple
English sentance into West Anglican Curmudgeon.
Note how each noun and each verb in the English
sentance is expanded and qualified in W.A.C. Once
understood this is an easy sub-language to master,
enabling you to expand short articles in English into
500 page books in W.A.C. once you get the hang
of it.<P>

      English:  "The BOY WALKED to the STORE and
                     BOUGHT a LOAF of BREAD."<P>

      W.A.C.:   "At some unspecified time and at an equally
indeterminate location, it has been alleged by sources we
may presume to credit -- at least within the parameters of
this discussion -- that a male, suppossedly well under the
term of his majority, did (and being so described, we can
assume funded for the purpose), make his way via peram-
bulation to a commercial establishment where we are to
suppose provisions were to be obtained, and having so
arrived, is further said to have purchased for an undisclosed
sum a standard measure of baked goods; most probably
bread as the term loaf has been suggested in this context
but not confirmed -- yet we can, for all practical purposes,
concede the probability that the quantity of victuals may
not have exceeded this single increment in light of the
routine nature of the errand, the lack of auxiliary conveyance
implied in the means of transit described, and the restricted
pecuniary allotments most commonly assigned to those
of such tender years, but to reach any more specific
conclusions based on the few facts available would perhaps
be imprudent."<P>

       I hope this makes Waite easier to understand and
appreciate.<P>

       Good Magick! (If one may presume to attribute or
assign a  beneficial quality to such a multiferious and
obscure. . . Oh, to hell with it!)<P>
