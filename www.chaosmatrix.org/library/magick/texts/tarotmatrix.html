<BR><HR><BR>

I went to a tarot reading workshop today
and learned something! This was new to me
so maybe it will be new to someone else ...<BR><BR>

I've always found the major arcana pretty
much self explanatory but you know (YES!
ok damnit I admit it!) I have always had to
resort to notes to read the minor arcana.
Well ... either that or just make it all up
which has some validity too ...<BR><BR>

But<BR><BR>

I learned there is a system behind the numbers.<BR>
The suits are fairly obvious:<BR><BR>

swords = communication, air<BR>
pentacles = materiality, earth<BR>
wands = action, fire<BR>
cups = emotion, water<BR><BR>

I actually knew that but it might be new to
someone else.<BR><BR>

Here's what was new for me:<BR><BR>

The numbers are based on traditional
numerology associations<BR><BR>

A  = beginning power<BR>
2  = partnership duality<BR>
3  = synthesis joy<BR>
4  = stabilize construct <BR>
5  = chaos versatility<BR>
6  = decision challenge<BR>
7  = wisdom mystery<BR>
8  = judgement confrontation<BR>
9  = attainment<BR>
10 = perfection wholeness<BR>
P  = child<BR>
Kn = teenager<BR>
K  = outer competence<BR>
Q  = inner competence<BR><BR>

So how does it work?<BR><BR>

Use the number key words with the suit's domain.
Let's say you get the dreaded 8 of swords (heh heh)<BR><BR>

Well ... swords are communication<BR>
8 means confrontation.<BR>
Taken together it means the person
may need to speak up abut something.
Or maybe they are afraid to or something
like that.<BR><BR>

Here's how the shortcut works for the 'people'
cards:<BR><BR>

page of cups ... think of how children handle emotion<BR>
knight of cups ... think of a teenager's response<BR>
king of cups ... a guy's stereotypically approach <BR>
queen of cups ... a woman's stereotypical approach<BR><BR>

If the suit is wands ... how do those people act?<BR>
If the suit is swords ... how do those people communicate?<BR>
If the suit is pentacles ... how do those people<BR>
handle the practical and sensual worlds?<BR><BR>

Well there you go!<BR>
Hope this helps someone.<BR><BR>

the trinity of jane ... aka ... synthesis and joy ;)<BR><BR>
