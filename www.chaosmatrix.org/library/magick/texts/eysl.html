<H3>Sources & Notes</H3>

I've supplied, in parentheses, the Greek word for each lifestage (male/female
when they differ), as given by Philo (De Op. Mun. 36).  The first seven
lifestages, transitions and nominal ages are given by Iamblichus (Theol. Arith.)
quoting Hippocrates (Hebd. 5), Philo (35-36), who quotes Hippocrates and Solon,
Isidore of Seville (De Num. 188c-d), Macrobius (Somn. Scip. VI), Martianus
Capella (De Nupt. VII), Ptolemy (Tetrab. IV.10); Westcott (Numbers 73, 76) was
also considered.  The ages used here are the same as in Iamblichus/Hippocrates
and Philo; the others agree with minor exceptions.  The eighth lifestage is
implied by Macrobius.  I take it to be the stage between death and rebirth,
which is sometimes seen before death in the numinous state of an Ancient Sage.<P>

The transition ages between lifestages shown above are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
hebdomads (7s).  From Platonic theory we might expect 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, which
are all the multiples of 2 and 3 (the primal even/female and odd/male numbers)
in the decad (1 is neither odd nor even, but the source of both, according to
the Pythagoreans).  Adopting this theory drops the V-VI transition age from 49
to 42 (which seems too low).<P>

In any case, the transition ages should not be taken too seriously; obviously
they are heavily influenced by Pythagorean theory.  See
<a href="lom.html">Opsopaus (Lib. de Oct.  Mut.) </a>
for the universal eightfold structure of cycles.

<H3>Notes</H3>

<B>Qualities & elements:</B>
The four qualities (corresponding to the quarters, the
solstices and equinoxes) and the four elements (cross-quarters) constitute the
eight radii of the wheel of the year.  As explained by Aristotle (De Cael. 268-
96, De Gen. & Cor. 329-31), each pair of qualities constitutes the element
between them (fire = hot + dry, water = cold + wet, etc.), and two adjacent
elements share the included quality (e.g. both air and fire are hot).  Each
quality and each element "rules" a quarter (so that their "domains" overlap);
that is, the four qualities exhaust the wheel of the year, as do the four
elements.  Thus (1) air rules I-II, (2) hot rules II-III, (3) fire rules III-IV,
etc.<P>

The hot quality is maximized at the summer solstice, and the cold quality at the
winter solstice.  The wet and dry qualities are at the two points of equilibrium
between hot and cold, and so correspond to the equinoxes (where light/dark =
hot/cold are equalized).  Cold promotes moisture, which fuels heat, which dries
things out.  Birth takes place when fluidity (0 = wet) is maximized, and the
discriminating force of heat (2) maximizes structure (3 = dry); thereafter the
chaotic (4 = cold) processes lead to its dissolution (0 = wet).  The resulting
correspondence between the elements and the four seasons is confirmed by
Aristides (De Mus. III.19), Isidore Sev. (De Nat. Rer. 1472), Peyligk (Phil.
Nat. Comp. 1499), Hippocrates (Nat. Man VII, Reg. I.33) and others.<P>

<B>Celestial sphere:</B>
Ptolemy (Tetrab. IV.10) associates the seven planetary
spheres with the first seven lifestages.  It seems natural, then, to associate
the eighth, astral sphere with the eighth, immaterial lifestage.  (This also
agrees with Gnostic ideas of the ascent of the soul.)<P>

<B>Sabbats and seasons:</B>
Varro (De Agri. I.28-36) describes eight seasons of the
agricultural year.  Their boundaries are the quarters (solstices and equinoxes)
and cross-quarters that are approximately midway between them.  Varro's dates
for the cross-quarters were determined by astronomical events (e.g. the rising
and setting of Sirius and the Pleiades), which have shifted over the intervening
millennia.  Therefore I have normalized them to Feb. 1, May 1, Aug. 1, Nov. 1.
Here are some modern markers with approximate dates (computed from a circular
astronomy-sliderule):

<pre>
transi-  nom.  astronomical event                                  approx.
tion     date                                                        date
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1         5/1  Vega on Eastern horizon at Sunset (cosmical rising)   4/29
               (Varro uses the heliacal rising of the Pleiades       5/15)
3         8/1  Sirius on Eastern horizon at Sunrise (heliacal rising) 8/4
5        11/1  Vega on Eastern horizon at Sunrise (heliacal rising)  11/5
               (Varro uses the cosmical rising of the Pleiades      11/15)
7         2/1  Altair on Western horizon at Sunset (heliacal setting) 2/6
</pre>

<P>

<B>Greek seasons:</B>
The Greeks originally had three seasons, then four, and later
seven.  Based on dates and agricultural activities, I have decided that the
Greek Ear (Spring) corresponds to the first two Roman seasons and to the first
two lifestages, though this is not certain.  By looking at their etymology we
can understand the meaning of the Greek seasons (LSJ s.vv. hora and the names of
the seasons):

<pre>
 I-II  Ear = prime flowering (spring)
 III   Theros = summer harvest (summer)
 IV    Opora = youthful ripeness, fruit (late summer)
 V     Phthinoporon = waning of Opora (autumn)
 VI    Sporetos = seed time (corn sowing)
 VII   Kheimon = winter cold & storms
 VIII  Phutalia = planting time (latter part of winter)
</pre>

<P>

<B>Form of the soul:</B>
The bodily loci of the "forms of the soul" (ta eide psukhes),
which correspond approximately to the chakras.  The "eighth chakra," the
"supercrown," is the divine force, located above the head, from which depends
the embodied soul (Timaeus 90a-b); the Stoics (Aetius, Dox. Gr. 4.21.1-4) also
recognized an eighth, transcendant "commanding-faculty" (hegemonikon) that
united and sustained the other seven parts of the soul.  For more detail and
sources, see
<a href="jo-tep.html">Opsopaus (Ta Eide Psuches)</a>.
Ideally, the lifestages correspond to
a shift of emphasis to the higher chakras (without neglecting the lower ones, of
course).

</pre>

<H3>Notes</H3>

Diogenes Laertius (VIII.10) says Pythagoras allotted 20 years to each stage.
Comparing with the nominal ages from the first chart shows only a rough
correspondence:

<pre>
 I-II      1-14   1-20
 III-IV    15-28  21-40
 V-VI      29-56  41-60
 VII-VIII  57-    61-80
</pre>

The four stages are ideally an ascent of emphasis through the four mental
faculties enumerated by Plutarch (Opin. Phil. I.3), Theon of Smyrna (Math. Plat.
38) and others:

<pre>
   lifestage     faculty                      characteristics       (qualities)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I-II      child  sensus (sensation)           fluid, discriminating (wet, hot)
III-IV    youth  opinio (opinion)             discriminating, rigid (hot, dry)
V-VI      adult  scientia (knowledge, skill)  rigid, unifying       (dry, cold)
VII-VIII  elder  mens (understanding)         unifying, fluid       (cold, wet)
</pre>

This is, in effect, an alchemical rotation through the elements air, fire,
earth, water (also known as Plato's Cycle).
