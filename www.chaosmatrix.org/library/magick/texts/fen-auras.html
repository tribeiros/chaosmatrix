I'm quite fond of the "soft eyes" technique.  This works best if you can
practice with a target wearing either white or black against a solid
background color, but this isn't necessary---I learned by just trying it in
everyday circumstances, but it takes a bit longer this way.<BR><BR>

Look at the person and scan the area around their head and shoulders.  Try
to "blur" your eyes some, either looking just past or just short of where
they actually are.  If you've ever looked at one of those stare-e-o-grams
with all the dots that converge to form a 3d image, then this is the same
type of eye-blurring effect you're doing, looking at a different distance
in space from your actually target.<BR><BR>

Keep moving the eyes around the area of the head and shoulders.  Sooner or
later you'll start to pick up auras and be able to discern color.  But when
I've looked at auras, I find that "color" is the closest english word to
describe what I see, because I'm actually getting some sort of an
impression of color instead of actually seeing color.  I've heard some
people actually see the colors; my guess is that it's their brain co-opting
that portion of their visible field to overlay the color information to
interpret it easier.<BR><BR>

Doing circular breathing helped me to learn this as well; taking long
breaths that round off at the top and bottom gently, instead of ending
sharply between inhale and exhale.<BR><BR>

Beware of spotting afterimages and confusing them for auras with this
technique.  If you see an aura and look away to a different place and you
can still see it, all you've gotten is an afterimage.  So don't stare for
too long at any given time.  Moving your eyes around the persons body while
scanning for the aura will also help prevent you burn an afterimage into
your eyes.<BR><BR>
