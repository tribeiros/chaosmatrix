<H1>The Declaration of Individual Autonomy</H1>
<H2>by Philip H. Farber</H2>

<HR>

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them
with others, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the
separate and equal station to which they may choose to aspire, a
decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We
hold that no truths are self-evident, but must have their
usefulness demonstrated. That all people are created with equal
freedom from tyranny, but frequently accept domination or
obedience to a legal code, to a greater or lesser degree from
person to person. That people are endowed with only what rights
they have chosen to be endowed with, through wisdom or common
folly, for wealth or ilth. That people can secure for themselves,
with understanding of their own unique situations, those rights
which best allow them to live in fruitful harmony with other
people. That whenever any person, Government, or other entity,
not fully recognizing the unique situation of each individual,
becomes in any way oppressive or destructive, people may choose
to ignore, alter or abolish such an institution, and to live in
whatever manner they decide, with understanding of the situation,
will allow them whatever conflict or harmony they so require for
their happiness and survival. That man can choose to resolve any
conflict through intelligence, with, adequate communication and a
full understanding of each and every point of view involved, by
each and every person involved. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that Governments long established should not be changed for light
and transient causes, but only after calm consideration of the
True Will and mutual goals of all those individuals involved. All
experience has shown that people are more disposed to suffer,
while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a
long train of abuses and usurpations evinces a design to reduce
them under absolute Despotism or Dogma not chosen by the
individual concerned, it is their right, it can be their choice,
to throw off such a Government and to accept responsibility, each
for their own future security.
<P>
The most apparent difficulty herein lies in the general inability
of people to understand the specific direction of their unique
organism, or, understanding it, to make the firm resolve
necessary to shake free the shackles of cultural conditioning and
Dogma accepted through poorly considered indoctrination.
Therefore, those of us who now declare their individual autonomy
(and this document speaks only for those who freely choose to do
so) are faced with a potentially arduous task of self-
examination, compounded by the resistance encountered from those
who do not comprehend the changes engendered by this individual
declaration. But the rewards of this liberation are enormous,
being the very fulfillment of each individual's own nature, and
therefore the nature of the human race as a whole. Those of us
who choose to accept this self-responsibility do so, we believe,
for the advantage of all.
<P>
The crimes against individuals by those who blindly group
together under the flags of Governments, religions, and other
institutions are too numerous to fully discuss, but can be
categorized in the following way: Actual legislation which limits
the freedom of individuals in speech, worship, thought, and any
actions which do not, themselves, infringe upon the freedoms of
others; Cultural norms, taboos, peer pressures, moral codes and
any other influences which likewise limit the freedoms of
individuals.
<P>
It should be strongly emphasized that we recognize that various
dogmas, models and systems are necessary for the harmonious
growth of humanity, but, in all things, these can be the choice
of the individual. If one person and another believe that it is
their will to band together for a specific purpose, under
delineated restrictions, then they are free to do so, given that
their purpose still respects and allows the differing beliefs and
actions of those who stay apart from their group. If one person
believes that it is his will to stand apart from all others, then
he is free to do so, given that he does not interfere with the
free behavior of any other. In the same manner, the dogma or
meta-dogma of this Declaration is intended to apply only to those
who freely choose to accept it as being beneficial or useful in
the attainment of their own True Will.
<P>
We, therefore, the people of the planet Earth who choose to
accept responsibility for our own lives, do publish and declare
that we can be FREE AND INDEPENDENT PEOPLE, that we are absolved
from all allegiance to any dogma, system or code that we have not
chosen for ourselves, that we as individuals have full power to
levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce
and to do all other Acts and Things which individual People may
of right do.<BR><BR>
