As my e-mail address indicates, I am a biologist.  People sometimes
ask me why.  After much serious thought, I came up with this
explanation:  (Yes, it is original -- mine, completely mine.)<P>

When I first started out, I was going to be a mathematician.  So I
took algebra, but I found that was highly variable.<P>

So, I tried geometry.  And that's where I learned all the angles.<P>

Then I took calculus.  That was truly an integrating experience, but
it definitely had its limits.<P>

After a great deal of consideration, I decided to turn away from math
and give some serious thought to science.<P>

I tried geology, but found that was kind of hard.<P>

Next I tried physics but I knew that would never work.<P>

And even though I'd heard chemists had all the solutions, I finally
opted for biology because, after all, it's a living.<P>
