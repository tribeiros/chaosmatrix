<H1>Is Hell Exothermic Or Endothermic?</H1>

<P><HR><P>


A true story:  A thermodynamics professor had written a take home
exam for his graduate students.
It had one question:<P>

<I>Is hell exothermic or endothermic?<BR>
Support your answer with a proof.</I><P>

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's
Law or some variant.<P>

One student, however wrote the following:<P>

<HR><P>

First, we postulate that if souls exist, they must have
some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass.
So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are
souls leaving?<P>

I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it
will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving.
As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different religions
that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state
that if you are not a member of their
religion, you will go to hell.  Since there are more
than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than
one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to
hell.<P>

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of
souls in hell to increase exponentially.<P>

Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell.
Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure
in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and
volume needs to stay constant.<P>

1) So, if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which
souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will
increase until all hell breaks loose.<P>

2) Of course, if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the
increase
of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until
hell freezes over.<P>

<HR><P>

The student got the only A.
