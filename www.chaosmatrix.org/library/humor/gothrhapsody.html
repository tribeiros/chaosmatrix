   Is this the goth life -<BR>

   Eyeline your eyes<BR>
   Get rid of your thighs and frooooown  -<BR>
   I'm just a goth boy, I need your Ennui -<BR>
   Because I bleakly come, bleakly go,<BR>
   Sometimes high, Always low,<BR>
   Anyway my hair blows, doesn't really matter to me, -<BR>
   to me -,</P>

   Mama, I used to look so nice,<BR>
   But now I've gone and thrown it all away -<BR>
   Mama, ooo,<BR>

   Goodbye everybody -<BR>
    I've got to go -<BR>
   Gotta leave you all behind and dye my hair -<BR>
   Mama, ooo -<BR>
   I don't want to die,<BR>
   I know it looks that way given the coffin -<BR>
   and the bats and the skull<BR>
   but it really doesn't matter.....</P>

<P>
   I  drew a little stiletto sticking in a man,<BR>
   Nephilim Nephilim now I'm listening to the Sisters<BR>
   Thunderbolt and lightning really are exciting me -<BR>
