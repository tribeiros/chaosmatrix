A Christian, a Wiccan, and a Sorceror were taking a whizz in a public
restroom.  The Christian finished first, and proceeded to scrub his hands
thoroughly, to the elbow, saying, "We Christians have learned to be clean."
The Wiccan finished next, and barely wet his fingertips, saying, "We Wiccans
have learned to respect Mother Earth and preserve her resources."  The
Sorceror zipped up and headed for the door, saying, "We Sorcerors have learned
not to piss on our hands."<P>
