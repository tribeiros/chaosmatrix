<H1>EVIL MONOPOLY</H1>

<P>A game for those aged from the cradle to beyond the grave.
Players can choose to be either Satan (upturned crucifix), Baron Samedi
(top hat), Cthulhu (tentacled mass), or Christopher Lee (pair of fangs)</P>

<P>The object of the game is to move around the board committing random
atrocities until the other players are either dead or just cant stand your
company anymore.</P>

<P>Players must bid for the purchase of city streets as they make their way
across the board, when a player has acquired a complete set of three
streets he can then build an extermination camp on one of them. If a player
manages to build four extermination camps on a single street, he will then
be allowed to open up an experimentation pen.</P>

<P>If another player lands on a street which you have already purchased,
then you must subject them to an hour of torture. This should primarily be
a physical torture such as the unforgiving administration of a 'Sunny
Delight' enema, but it could also involve elements of
emotional/psychological torture such as exposure to the films of Chris
Tucker. </P>

<P>If another player lands on a street upon which you have built an
extermination camp, then you must immediately gas them and round up their
known family and friends.</P>

<P>If another player lands on a street upon which you have built an
experimentation pen, then you must surgically modify your opponent until
they are effectively dragged in to another species or sub species of
humanity. Extra points may be awarded for detail, for example the
introduction of exotic bacteriological agents to the central nervous system
or the grafting of amphibian or reptilian aspects to the subjects torso
such as gills, scales or tentacles would be most auspicious.</P>

<P>The square in the top right hand corner of the board is the Immanentize
the Eschaton square, every time you pass this square you may collect 200
innocent souls. </P>

<P>Landing on a square marked 'Chance' will automatically result in a game
of russian roulette.  If the player is still intact after this s/he may
then select a card from the top of the pile.  chance cards include commands
such as...</P>

 <P><UL>
  <LI>'Fuck a baby seal in the eye socket, move forward one space'</LI>
  <LI>'Fuck a baby seal in the eye socket then wipe off on the skin of a
panda, move forward three spaces'</LI>
  <LI>'Get out of R'lyeh free'</LI>
 </UL></P>

<P>Landing on a square marked 'Community Chest' will automatically result
in the player prostituting his or her body out to the other players to do
with as they will.  If the player is still intact after this s/he may then
select a card from the top of the pile.  Community Chest cards include
commands such as:</P>

 <P><UL>
  <LI>'You have won a tall, dark and gruesome contest, move forward one
space'</LI>
  <LI>'Smoke crack with a christian fundamentalist group but forget to
horrifically violate them afterwards, miss a turn'</LI>
  <LI>'Go directly to R'lyeh, do not Immanentize the Eschaton, do not
collect 200 innocent souls'</LI>
 </UL></P>

<P>Whoever is left standing at the end of the game will become the star of
a series of films made by the hammer house of horror during the
sixties.</P>
