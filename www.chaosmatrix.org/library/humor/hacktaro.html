<B>1. The MAGICIAN:</B><BR>
a hacker with a Mac, a Pentium box, a Sparc, and a Cray on the table
in front of him --- all running the same program with the same GUI. An

An old hacker, white-bearded, burns the midnight oil; its
Star-of-David flame illuminates his keyboard.<P>

<B>10. The WHEEL OF FORTUNE:</B><BR>
A rotating wheel. Cray is on the side going down, despite its good

A cold-faced woman holds a calculator in one hand and a delete- key in
the other.<P>

<B>12. The HANGED MAN:</B><BR>

circumstances.<P>

<B>13. DEATH:</B><BR>

moment of peace.<P>

pool, offering suggestions that may ultimately prove deadly. The moon
shines through a window.<P>

<B>19. The SUN:</B><BR>
A naked child riding a winged rocking horse programs clever
applications on a high-quality workstation.<P>

<B>20. JUDGEMENT:</B><BR>
An angel blows a trumpet; all over the net, web pages arise, to be
rated Cool or not.<P>

<B>21. The WORLD:</B><BR>

clouds, a 3-d mouse in each hand. The four winged beings from the
Wheel of Fortune surround her.<P>
