<H1>Butt Prints in the Sand</H1>

<HR><BR>

One night I had a wondrous dream,<BR>
One set of footprints there was seen,<BR>
The footprints of the Goddess they were,<BR>
But mine were not along the shore.<BR><BR>

But then some stranger prints appeared,<BR>
and I asked Her, "What have we here?<BR>
These prints are large and round and neat,<BR>
But much too big to be from feet."<BR><BR>

"My child," She said in somber tones,<BR>
"For miles I carried you alone.<BR>
I challenged you to walk in faith,<BR>
But you refused and made me wait."<BR><BR>

"You would not learn, you would not grow,<BR>
The walk of faith, you would not know,<BR>
So I got tired, I got fed up,<BR>
And there I dropped you on your butt.<BR><BR>

"Because in life, there comes a time<BR>
When one must fight, and one must climb,<BR>
When one must rise and take a stand,<BR>
Or leave their butt prints in the sand."<BR><BR>
