Hello, welcome to the MID Call Center/Psychiatric Hotline.<P>

If you are obsessive-compulsive, please press 1 repeatedly.<P>

If you are co-dependent, please ask someone to press 2.<P>

If you have multiple personalities, please press 3, 4, 5 and 6.<P>

If you are paranoid-delusional, we know who you are and what you want.
Just stay on the line so we can trace the call.<P>

If you are schizophrenic, listen carefully and a little voice will tell
you which number to press.<P>

If you are manic-depressive, it doesn't matter which number you press.
No one will answer.<P>

If you think you are possessed by a demon, press 6 three times.<P>
