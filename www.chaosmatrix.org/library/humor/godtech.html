<H1>Things overheard at God's Tech Support.</H1>

<P><HR><P>

"There is an upgrade path from the Old to the New Testament,
but it's difficult and unsupported."<P>

"We were only able to get the first seven Commandments
on the stone tablets.  The last three will be in
Commandments '98."<P>

"You can't get your bush to burn?  Have you tried sacrifice?"<P>

"The 'virgin birth' is not a bug, it's a documented feature."<P>

"You'll need more RAM to run all four horseman concurrently."<P>

"The first semaphore is being dropped, the second is returning
an olive branch."<P>

"I.S. says it will rain for exactly 20 days."<P>

"Kai's Revelations Tools produce some really cool
effects but they're difficult to understand and use."<P>

"We killed the process, but three days later it came back."<P>

"The walls of Jericho won't fall without a 100% fully compatible
Soundblaster Card."<P>

"The voice of God is a standardized protocol, but each prophet
implements it differently."<P>

"My wife looked at K&R and now she's a pillar of salt."<P>

"Each loaf and fish comes with an AOL disk!"<P>

"Yes, the documentation is poorly organized, contradictory
and written by committee.  It's still better than UNIX man pages."<P>

"Adam & Eve would still be in the garden if they'd eaten the Windows."<P>

"Who told you that?  Lucifer?  Of COURSE he'd say heaven has heating
problems."<P>

"Ah, no sir.  No, I'm afraid not.  We stopped honoring indulgences
hundreds of years ago."<P>

"No.  I'm afraid not.  That's NOT what the Rapture is all about.  In
fact,
that's still classified as a sin".<P>

"No, no, no.  That's NOT what was meant by 'Love thy neighbor as
thyself'."<P>

"The Apocrypha?  I'm sorry sir.  We don't support third party
additions."<P>

"Yes we do offer a lifetime guarantee.  As long as you registered
yourself with us via baptism, you're covered.  Yes, even then.  Yes, we
know
it's quite a good deal.  Why thank you, we like to think it's the best
deal
around."<P>

"Did you read the release notes for Godly service?  No?  Well, it
clearly
states that 'Celibate' was a typo.  It should have been 'Celebrate'...
Sir?  Sir?"<P>

"Yes, there's an SDK and we have done some limited partnerships in the
past.
In fact, some developers had access to the Miracles SDK for awhile.
However,
we ran into some problems with legal, so it was pulled."<P>

"I'm sorry.  There currently no way to extend the beta period for an
individual human."<P>

"The office of God has no official comment on the use or existence of
other 'companies', past, present or future."<P>

"We simply provide a tool called 'life'.  It's neither good nor bad.
What
you do with it is up to you.  However, you may want to get in touch
with our marketing department so we can use you as an endorsement or
case
study if things go particularly well."<P>

"Satan called in again, pretending to be a customer."<P>

"Man, I hate taking those walking on water calls, especially when
they've already fallen in a few times."<P>

"I'm sorry sir, but we do not support life on Mars."<P>

"You killed your son to prove your faith?  Didn't you see the addendum
to the readme.txt?"<P>

"We have seen problems with receiving the Holy Spirit, so we need to
re-initialize your COM port."<P>

"I'm very sure that if it's got serial number 666, it's not our
product."<P>

"You're feeling lustful for your neighbor's wife?  We have a technote
for that."<P>

"Worshipping a false idol certainly is in violation of the support
agreement."<P>

"Ma'am, yelling at me isn't going to make Him fix the problem
any sooner."<P>
