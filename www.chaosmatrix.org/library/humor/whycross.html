<B>Subject:</B> [z-list] Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road?<P>

Found on usenet.

<P><HR><P>


Alexandrian/Gardnerian: To reveal this would be to
break my oath of secrecy. I can say, though, that it
*really* is an ancient rite, dating far back in time,
back even before 1951, and I have learned it from an
unbroken lineage. As Gerald said, it takes a chicken
to make an egg.<P>

Asatru: First, we don't believe in a "One Chicken" or
a "Hen and Rooster." We believe in many chickens.
Second, "crossing the road" is part of the three
levels, or worlds, and the chicken simply crossed from
one level to another. Hail to the Chickens!<P>

British Traditional: The word "chicken" comes from a
very specific Old English word ("gechekken"), and it
only properly applies to certain fowl of East Anglia
or those descended therefrom. As for the rest, I
suppose they are doing something remotely similar to crossing
the road, but you must remember that traditional roads
are not to be confused with the modern roads....<P>

Celtic: In County Feedbeygohn on Midsummer's day,
there is still practiced St. Henny's Dance, which is a
survival of the old pagan Chicken Crossing fertility
rite. Today, modern pagans are reviving the practice,
dedicated to the Hen and the Green Rooster.<P>

Ceremonial: "Crossing the road" is a phrase that
summarizes many magical structures erected and timed
by the chicken to produce the energy necessary for the
intention of the travel across the road. For example,
the astrological correspondences had to be correct,
the moon had to be waxing (if the chicken intended to
come to the other side of the road) or waning (if the
chicken intended to flee to the other side of the
road), and the chicken had to prepare herself through
fasting and proper incantations. Note: certain forms
of invocation (summoning an egg *inside* your chicken
self) can produce abnormal or even dangerous eggs
and should only be conducted inside a properly erected
barnyard....<P>

Chaos: Thinking in terms of "roads" and "crossings" is
simply looking at the formal, typically perceived
structure of chicken crossing space-time. We, instead,
focus on the possibility of chicken crossing itself;
what appears to be a random act is thus actually the
norm ---- it is the **road** which is the freak of
chance. Indeed, quantum mechanics now demonstrates
what we knew all along: two roads can simultaneously
exist in the same place at the same time. Thus, by attuning
ourselves to the dynamic energy (called "crossing"),
we can manifest the road. Of course, to the
knowledgeable, this appears as a chicken crossing the
road.<P>

Dianic: The chykyn ("chicken" is term of patriarchal
oppression) sought to reclaim for herself the right to
be on the other side of the road, after it had been
denied to her for centuries. By doing so, she
reawakened the power of the Hen within herself.<P>

Discordian: cock-a-doodle-doo!<P>

Druid: To get to the sacred grove, of course! Keep in
mind that 99% of everything written about
chickens-crossing-the-road is pure hogwash,
based on biased sources. Yes, there were a few
unfortunate chicken sacrifices in the past, but that
is over now...<P>

Eclectic: Because it seemed right to her at the time.
She used some Egyptian style corn and a Celtic
sounding word for the road and incorporated some
Native American elements into her Corn-name,
Chicken-Who-Dances-and-Runs-with-the-Wolves.<P>

Faery: In twilight times and under sparkling stars,
those properly trained can still see the chickens
crossing the roads. Reconnecting with these "fey-fowl"
as they cross is crucial to restoring the balance
between the energies of modern development and living
with the earth.<P>

Family Traditional: Growing up, we didn't think much
about "crossing the road." A chicken was a chicken. It
crossed the road because that was what worked to get
her to the other side. We focused on what worked, and
we worked more with the elders of the barnyard and
less with all this "guardians of the chickencoop"
business. We didn't get our concepts of "chickens" or
"the other side" from Gardner, either.  You can choose
not to believe us since we did not "scratch down" on paper
what was clucked to us orally (which, at certain times
in history, was the only way to avoid becoming Easter
chicken soup!), but that doesn't change the facts:
there *were* real chickens, and they *really did*
cross the road!<P>

Kitchen Witch: The chicken crossed the road to get
food, to get a rooster or to get away from me after I
decided to have chicken for supper!<P>

Left Hand Path: White, fluffy chickens prancing across
the road! Do you think that is *all* there is to
crossing the road? Do you *dare* to know the dark side
of crossing the road and the *other* path to
self-development?<P>

New Age: The chicken crossed the road because she
chose this as one her lessons to learn in this life.
Besides, there was so much incense and bright, white
corn to explore on the Other Side.<P>

Newbie: well, 'cause I read in this really kewl book
that said, like, chickens are supposed to cross the
road, right?<P>

Posting on an Online Discussion Group: What do you
mean <I>why did the chicken cross the road?</I>???!!!???
Haven't you read **any** of the previous posts? We've
been [expletive deleted] debating every word of that
question, painstakingly trying to come to some kind of
answer. I know you wrote <I>all i wnted to know was why
chickens cross the road, i'm not looking for any
chicken spells</I> but I'm fed up with newbies who
can't even bother to REEEEEEEEAAADDD the posts on that
very topic! No, this is *not* a flame. But, I and
several others here have the *maturity* to properly
explore and respond to this question, and we were
properly trained; we *didn't* just read a book and
think we were full-fledged chickens. <I>whew, feeling
much better after ranting</I><P>

"Sethian"/Jane Roberts: Session 666; Wednesday, Dec.
2, 1969; 9:00 p.m.: Now, you create your own chicken,
each of you individually and en masse. Your physical
senses fool you into believing you are seeing a
chicken crossing the road, when instead, the chicken has
already crossed the road, and hasn't even begun to
cross the road. There is a probable chicken that never
crossed the road as well. Further, because you each
perceive a chicken, there is not only one chicken but,
in fact, many different chickens. As I have said
before, time is simultaneous. All probable versions of
the chicken--past, present and future--exist at once
in the spacious present. It is only because you
*believe* [emphatically] that time is linear, with
each moment followed by another in one-line kind of
fashion, that you perceive the chicken taking chicken
steps to get to the other side of the road.  It does no good to
ask "Which came first, the chicken or the egg,"
either, for they both exist at once in simultaneous
time. [9:10 p.m.] Now, there are families of chicken
consciousness. All life seeks value fulfillment, for
consciousness is consciousness. What you perceive as a chicken may be
something far different in another reality. The
chicken may, for example, be a fragment personality of
your entity. The chicken is no less than you are,
however, simply because it is a chicken. Now, the chicken has
its reality, and you have your reality. But the
chicken is more than a chicken [emphatically], and
*you are more than you think that you are!* [Pause one
minute]: The chicken crosses the road because it
*believes* it can, and it does. It knows that it is
sacred and that it will not die. You (underline 'you')
also are sacred and you will not die. But as long as
you believe that it is unsafe to cross the road, you
must take chicken steps and obey the laws that you
have agreed upon to get to to the other side safely.
[End at 9:30 p.m. Jane came out of trance easily. She
didn't remember a word she had spoken as Seth.]<P>

Solitaire: The chicken didn't want to be part of a
coven or an oven.<P>

Shaman: Crossing the road is a way to reconnect with
the healing, visionary lifeways of the past. Chickens
have long known this, but increasingly the Rooster's
Movement is adding more roosters to the crossings too.<P>

Snert: Hey, are you guys really chickens? Can you
giveme a spellthat will make a chicken cross the road?<P>

Wiccan: The chicken crossed the road because she felt
like she was finally "coming home." She could do it
alone or with others, but she had to call to the
Guardians of the Watchtowers of the Barnyard first ...
uhm, after casting the circle.<P>

<H3>How Some Pagan Authors Might Respond:</H3>

Margot Adler: The recent chicken resurgence, it can be
argued, is directly based on a response to the
suburban middle class experience. While I found that
chickens-who-cross-roads who responded to my survey
are of a wide range of ages and backgrounds, I
discovered some trends in the "why" of crossing the
road. For some it is was freedom. For some it
is chickenism. Many chickens told me they crossed the
road for intellectual satisfaction. One thing is
clear: the growth of road  crossing by chickens is
expanding in the numbers of chickens and in the ways
they cross the road, including at chicken festivals
and for political blocking of roads.<P>

P.E.I. Bonewits: Real crossing-the-road, we have seen,
is a very interwoven and complicated subject. Our
conclusion could be that real crossing-the-road is the
build up of chicken emotion in conjunction with
chicken concepts to vary the modulation of chicken
energy so as to effect the modulation of the road's
energy. That's all! Perhaps it is unfortunate, though,
to use the word "chicken" in relation to it, since
the "C" word is being used now in a way it was never
used before in the English language and is an utterly
meaningless term without a qualifying adjective. And
this, of course, is the fault of the medieval
Christian Church, through the Gothic Chickens it invented and
used as the basis of persecuting men, women and
chickens. The word "chicken" itself comes from
an Indo-European root, "cheeka/e" meaning "one who
lays eggs," and it has no relation to the later
Anglo-Saxon word for "wise spirit of flight," as so
often stated by certain contemporary "Chics."
An'Chk'Rrhod ("Our Own Chickens on Our Own Roads"), an
authentic Neo-Chicken Rooster tradition, offers the best
of paleo-, meso- and neo- Chickenism ...<P>

Carlos Castenada 4/10/1964 I spent 14 hours, without
food or water, sitting on the dirt and under the sun
in front of Don Juan's house, grinding chicken feed. I
asked Don Juan if I could have a drink of water,
and he told me that it was always this way, that a man
who wanted to cross the road with the chicken cannot
have any food or water till the chicken feed is
ground. I asked Don Juan if the chicken is an ally,
like the little smoke. Don Juan seemed to get angry and
stayed silent. After I completed grinding the corn, I
hallucinated from heat exhaustion, and Don Juan said I
was ready. As I collapsed to my side, I spilled the
chicken feed around me. A chicken appeared to be
eating the feed around me, and I became strangely
absorbed in the vision. I heard Don Juan's voice tell
me, "You must let the chicken cross the road into you.
It is very painful, but for a man of knowledge it is easy."<P>

Scott Cunningham: A chicken passes between the
grasses, clucking. The wind blows, and the chicken
knows, *knows*, that this is the time. She puts her
energy into taking the steps, in harmony with the
gravel and the stones of the road. She is across; it
is over, and the chicken stands in the field on the
other side of the road. ... Natural chicken crossing
is unique among most other branches of the art of
chicken road crossing. It doesn't require years of
collecting or fashioning coops, feeders or hen houses.
Indeed, the most important tools of natural chicken
crossing are free: the road, the chicken and you,
your personal chicken power. You're already familiar
with it. You've felt it. You *are* a chicken. Crossing
the road is you, with your chicken need. And, you can
do it on your own.
After all, who initiated the first chicken?<P>

Janet and Stewart Farrar: Since so many editions of
Gardner's Chicken Book of Crossings have appeared in
print (some accurate, some not), we think it won't
"lay an egg" too much if we clearly present "The
Chicken Crossing Rite," especially if we do so after two and
half pages of well researched introduction set in
six-point type. In version A of the Chicken Crossing
Rite, we find many pseudo-archaisms (e.g.,"Yea, Ye
Anciente Rite of Ye Chiks and Ye Rodes is a moste
powerful Crafting,taking thy athame..."); however,
Doreen Valiente notes (in version C, which is what we
present), and we agree, that underlying it all is a
basic ritual for summoning the astral road through the
spirit of the Chicken (drawn down in the person of the
High Priestess, holding the black handled feed bin; of
course, a second degree may assist or perform the rite
when....<P>

Llewellyn's Practical Chicken Magick Series: To some
people, the idea that "chickens crossing the road" is
practical comes as a surprise. It shouldn't. The whole
idea of Crossing the Road is practical for chickens.
While Crossing the Road is also, and properly so,
concerned with spiritual growth and psychological
transformation --the "why" of crossing the road--
every chicken's life must rest firmly on material
roads.
Crossing the Road is the flowering of chicken
potential. And the profits from publishing all those
books on how to do so? Well, that ain't chicken
feed...<P>

Starhawk: The chicken crossed the road to reclaim the
crossing experience, the experience of being fully
alive, with streams and earth and rocks and road, in
the fullness of her chickenhood after thousands of
years of roosterarchy. The chicken crossing the road
--not a chicken laying eggs, not a chicken being
roasted and eaten-- a chicken strong and free,
crossing the road, this is something I can believe in.
We chickens, as chickens, can reclaim this in harmony
with the Earth who gives life to all chickens and Who
has been terribly scratched by roosters. Exercises:
Dance the Spiral Chicken.<P>

Doreen Valiente: Old Chicken really did exist, and she
really did cross the road. Gerald talked about her
often, but she didn't cross the road till before I
began studying with Gerald. Still there are records of
Old Chicken which confirm her reality. As for all the
comments that Gerald had a "thing" for chickens, that
is simply not true. The reason we worked with chickens
is really quite simple: it worked!<P>

Silver Raven Wolf: Although many times people have
asked me why exactly the chicken crossed the road, I
often wonder myself. My point is that every chicken
comes to the road in a different way, and there is no
one correct way for the chicken to get to the road to
be crossed. The study of crossing the road is hard
work if the chicken is going to develop any degree of
proficiency. It is not something where you can just
cluck yourself across the road. The first time my
chicken crossed the road was for my chicken's friend,
whose rooster was being abusive. The chicken worked
the steps for crossing the road after carefully
considering all the reasons for crossing the road and
all the steps she would have to take. Finally, my
chicken just started clucking and flapping her wings
and started across the road. When she reached the
other side, her friend's rooster was respectful!
Afterwards, the chicken ate some corn to ground herself.<P>
