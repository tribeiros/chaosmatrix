<p>The mighty river flows, and nothing will stop it, ever. No dam can be conceived
that will hold this most anomalous of rivers. Sitting on its banks - if you
are lucky or unlucky enough to find them - you can see the flotsam and
jetsam of mysterious otherworldly places go by. The composition of the
river's passengers varies from time to time and from place to place, but
there is one constant: corpses.
</p>

<p>Over the time I have been following the river, I have seen many terrible
things. Some of them were so decomposed as to be unrecognizable, but some
of them were merely impossible creatures I cannot describe. None of them
prepared me for what I saw that fateful day. The corpse I saw was my own.
</p>

<p>I chased it downstream for quite a while, desperately searching for some
way to get it to shore, for some way to prove it wasn't my dead face that
was staring at me. Even with the eyes gone, even from across the river,
even while running and scrambling to catch it, I knew it was mine.
</p>

<p>I came very close to snaring it, but I simply didn't have the stamina to
keep up the chase. As I gave up, exhausted, a rapture owl settled into the
tree beside me. I watched it, and it watched me, and a disturbing feeling
came over me as we watched each other. I felt that it knew some terrible
secret that I really ought to know, but would not discover until it was far
too late. Or perhaps that's just my imagination embellishing the incident.
I have nightmares about it every night, now. And here's a curious thing:
in the first nightmare, my corpse spoke to me a single word: "Don't."
