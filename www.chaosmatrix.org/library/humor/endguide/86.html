<title>Get Off Your Ass and Do Something (86)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, you may remember, if you dare, the sad excuse for a
man I once was. I'm here to tell you how I changed all that. I was a pig in
a blanket, a dog in a manger, a fruitcake in a bungalow, and I decided that
what I needed to do to fix myself up was to just get off my ass and do
something. So I asked my neighbor (he calls himself Kapoopoo, or something,
but I think his real name is Emily) to watch the house while I was gone.
</p>

<p>I went down to the marketplace to the tent where they read your DNA and
turn it into a song, and I paid them my fifty cents, and inserted the tape
into my compact abdominal player that I got for free for stabbing myself in
the eye with a fork in a swanky restaurant, and I was sailing down the
street in the throes of ecstasy, thumbscrews and silly noodles in my wake,
when I came to a dead stop at a manhole.
</p>

<p>I asked the man, who seemed embarrassed by the way I was staring at him,
how he had come by his hole. He smacked me so hard I had to start my life
over from the bottom up. But this time around, I made a single simple
change. Instead of fornicating with evildoers, I elected to fornicate with
everybody, regardless of their personal value system.
</p>

<p>And that's why I'm here today, a changed man. Because if it hadn't been for
the dirty napkins, I'd have starved to death long ago, and I feel that this
group has done more to help me through my lives than any other random
collection of losers I have had the misfortune to have to deal with. Thank
you and good night.
