<title>The Volcano (97)</title>

<p>As we descended warily into the volcano, the tensions among the members of
the expedition grew. A gloom hung over the place, but it was more than
that. There was a sense, shared by all, that we were walking into the maw
of a monster - a sense of foreboding that was to be borne out by events.
Only Alex, the organizer of the expedition, seemed relatively immune, but
even he could be seen nervously fidgeting with the mysterious agate pendant
he wore about his neck.
</p>

<p>We found Hellmouth, just as Alex had said we would. One wonders where he
obtains such knowledge, the better to avoid those places. The walls of the
labyrinth were coated with a shimmering lichen. Its reddish sheen was
interrupted at intervals by what looked like baleful, squinting eyes. What
we took at first to be rocks were soon discovered to be ornate carvings of
hideous beings engaged in a grotesque variety of unseemly acts. There were
numerous small caves off the main arteries that we could not enter, and I
think it is better that we did not.
</p>

<p>When we found the portal, the men refused to open it. I cannot blame them.
But it did no good, for the portal opened by itself, and then - O gods! -
they came. Ants, or what once must have been ants. They were huge, and
fast, and before we could move to defend ourselves they had carried off
several of us. I am lucky to have escaped the first onslaught. I can still
hear the screams of the men being dragged down into the Pit. I pray that I
can survive until I can find my way out. The world must be warned of the
horrors being bred here!
