<title>Just Pants (84)</title>

<body>
<p>My pants deny my existence. I struggle with them daily, yet they insist
that they are the master. Who is to settle this dispute? Lying, wheezing,
in my bed of potato and vinegar, I call for the princes of the boudoir, but
they heed me not. I fret, and in fretting, I sprain a whim. Damn. I must
go, and leave my pants behind. I spit on them as I leave, but they are not
ashamed.
</p>

<p>I stroll down the avenue, aware that in my pantslessness I am the focus of
attention. I am secretly elated, but at the same time, I am worried. I do
not have a spaniel, either, yet I do not experience the joy of being
without one. I collapse in the street, crying bitter tears at the emotions
I can only deduce, for I am too numb to experience them. I am wracked by
despair as I realize I have been feeling the rapture of kazoolessness my
entire life, and yet it has not moved me.
</p>

<p>As I lie sprawled in the street, passersby stop to taunt me and throw me
gnarled twigs. I catch and eat them, for I deserve no better. And as I
crunch on my gritty repast, I feel a prod in a part of my body that only
one creature dares to touch. Could it be - it is! My pants! They have come
to rescue me! No, it is only a squirrel.
</p>

<p>When, at last, I return home, I find that my pants have locked me out and
have taken my wives for their own, and are redecorating the palace. I have
only myself to blame.
