<title>An Itch in Time Saves Nine (95)</title>

<p>I eventually found a small shop with a simple sign reading "Hair". I
entered, hoping that they would be able to help with the itching, which was
really getting unbearable. I entered, and found the proprietor busily
rearranging his balms and ointments. There were no other customers, and it
didn't seem that there had been for some time. "Excuse me," I asked, "do
you perhaps have something that might stop my hairpiece from itching?"
</p>

<p>The man looked at me, as if startled by my question. "A hairpiece? Not a
Hair piece?" he asked. "Um, yes, a hairpiece. Can you help me? Please, it's
getting quite bad. May I sit down for a moment?" He gestured broadly at the
chair, smiling. "I thought you were the one, you know, but then you started
talking all funny. I guess you can't be too careful." He deftly removed my
hairpiece. "Wait!" I protested. "I just want something to control the
itching!" I tried to get up, but I was held fast in the chair by an
invisible force.
</p>

<p>The owner bent over, breathing warmly into my ear. "It's Their Way or the
Hair Way. Which do you choose? Whose side are you on? You came here for a
reason. You might not even have known it. But you came nonetheless." I
tried to speak, but I could not. He began massaging something into my
scalp. The itching stopped immediately, and it felt like my brain was
warming up. "When the Hair comes, you will understand. You have been chosen
both for what you are, and what you will be." He placed a mask over my
face, and I lost consciousness.
