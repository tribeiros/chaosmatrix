<p>Adventurous to the last, I finally dared to open the trapdoor in the
bathroom last night. A ladder decorated with tiny styrofoam butterflies led
down to a dimly lit chamber. On the wall was a panel with three buttons
like elevator call buttons. A tiny gargoyle was to the left of each button.
</p>

<p>I pressed the first button, which was labelled "Death", and its gargoyle
was a chicken on its way to slaughter. A doorway appeared in the wall, and
beyond it was another chamber. I could not enter, but I saw a bespectacled
professor lecturing to row upon row of furiously scribbling moles. "The
world," he said, "is like a condom. You come into it, and, er, well, the
analogy breaks down a bit at that point." I saw what the moles were
writing: "Security of the team is paramount," over and over, every letter
slanted differently.
</p>

<p>The second button was labelled "Verity", and its gargoyle was an earthworm
dried in the sun. Another doorway which I could not enter appeared. Here
there was a great pool, where radishes were being electroplated. On a 
platform above the pool, a judge was ordering beautiful models to leap 
into the pool, whereupon they became radishes. A bear with mirrored shades 
was acting as court stenographer.
</p>

<p>The third button was labelled "Optimism", and its gargoyle was Pee-Wee
Herman. I pressed it, and I achieved enlightenment.
