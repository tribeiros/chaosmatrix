<title>Auntie Biotic (68)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>When you're not feeling well, why not pick up the phone and call your good
old Auntie Biotic? She'll whisk right over in that zesty red Ferrari of
hers, trailing goo from the manifold (why won't she fix that?) and bubbling
good cheer until her hair froths up and you have to pen her up for an hour
before she stops dripping.
</p>

<p>She's got appetizers of all descriptions, dainty little tidbits and
sweetmeats and otherwise unpalatable organs, decoratively arranged on a
platter of cheese so you don't have to worry about whether to unpack that
cheese log that's been growling at you from the closet for lo these many
years. She'll sprint around your happy home, leaving tiny spots of
effervescent, luminescent, sparkling grease for you and yours to enjoy from
afar while you recline in the comfort of her bucket seats.
</p>

<p>Pull up a chair and listen to her stories, like the one about the girl who
got herself knocked up by sitting on a plank, and had to give the baby to
Satan because she picked her nose while pregnant, and then he (the baby)
was nominated for Antichrist at three, but lost to some Norwegian kid who
could shoot fire from his nose. Or don't. It's all the same to Auntie
Biotic. She's happy to crochet your hair into a warm afghan without even
removing it from your head, if you like.
</p>

<p>Just don't mention beets to her and you'll be fine.
