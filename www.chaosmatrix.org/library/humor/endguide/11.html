<title>Tiny Dalmatians</title>

<p>You think you've got problems? My house is infested with tiny Dalmatians.
They're all over the place. My wife's afraid to come out of her box, and
she even wakes up screaming in the middle of the night because while we
were asleep they set up little factories in the closet. I try to sweep them
out, but they keep rebuilding. I don't know what the *hell* they're making,
but it can't be legal. I mean, they could apply for a permit and make the
stuff on their own property, couldn't they?
</p>

<p>The other day there was a whole pack of them making fun of the cat. The
poor thing was just standing there and taking it, she wouldn't even hiss at
them. By the time it was over there must have been fifty of 'em, hollering
wise-ass comments at her, and making gruesome scatological remarks. She
won't stop licking herself now, I had to have the vet give me some huge red
pills so it wouldn't bother me.
</p>

<p>We tried spraying once. We left a great big stack of fashion magazines out
as bait in the spare bedroom, and once there were a couple hundred of them
in there, we let 'em have it with some of the canisters of carpet cleaner
we had lying around. Those bastards must have known something was up,
because they let loose with a barrage of Molotov cocktails and tear gas and
nearly torched the whole house.
</p>

<p>So don't come whining to me about your tiny schnauzers.
