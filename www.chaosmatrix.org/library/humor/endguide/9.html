<title>The Power of Love (9)</title>

<p>It wasn't by chance that they met that first night. Fate had ordained that
their lives be intertwined, and from that point forward, there was no
escape. He found her irresistible, despite her immense height and large,
dangling ears; she likewise was drawn like a moth to a taxi to his charming
yet incomprehensible banter and the solemn way he would gaze at her when he
recovered from his fits of manic belching.
</p>

<p>Their passion quickly ignited. They spent many sleepless nights together,
and the quilts they made those evenings are renowned for their mystical
healing powers and ghastly patterns. And despite the horrible mutations
they both began to suffer during these weeks, their love remained
unblemished.
</p>

<p>For their love did more than keep them warm at night - it bathed the area
for miles around in mysterious reality-warping radiation. For their every
kiss, a nearby dog grew a new limb; for their every hug, a debilitating
disease appeared. Some of the more interesting things they did turned frogs
into peanuts at a distance of thirty miles, and made quite a bit of noise
as well.
</p>

<p>A crater stands now where they once lived. They say that if you stand
there, the wind blowing over its glassy surface sounds like a lonely guinea
pig. Which is rather odd, if you think about it.
