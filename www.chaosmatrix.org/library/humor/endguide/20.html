<p>The battlefield is covered with silence. If you even consider speaking,
there on that scarred plain, the air around you will seem to gather itself
together oppressively, threatening you, daring you to disturb the peace of
those who have died here.

<p>The battle was many years ago, though, and the corpses have long since come
home to roost. The place remains deserted, except for one curious denizen.

momentarily disoriented, something grabs your left arm. Was that a needle?
In the ensuing delirium, you take in the inventory as if in a dream. You
feel strangely compelled to purchase. You approach the register, bearing a
heavy load of mysterious cardboard boxes. Leon leers at you as he takes
your credit card and slides it through the reader. When he returns it to
you, it seems to have faint streaks of blood on it, but on closer
inspection, they are gone.
</p>

<p>You return home to discover that all the boxes are empty save one. It
contains a small photograph of Leon, grinning and waving a flag. He seems to
be watching you. You discard it and stumble to bed. But in the trashcan,
the picture of Leon is no longer grinning, but looking quite miffed...
