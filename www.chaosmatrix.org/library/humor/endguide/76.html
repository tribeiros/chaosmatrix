<title>Remembrance of Children Not to Be (76)</title>

<p>Step lightly, for without warning you may slide on the detritus of the
nomads. Are they not swarming around us even now? Their tents sparkle like
sparkly things. Let us journey thither, and upset their canisters, and
topple their mighty piles, and steal their onions, which they prize.
</p>

<p>Out of the onion of their chieftain I shall fashion me a wainscoting, of
silk and superconducting ceramic, and I shall place it, oh, about
waist-high for reflective luxury. I will summon my thousands of children
around me, and we will play "Prod the Mountain King" until the police come.
</p>

<p>Ah, those will have been merry days. If only I had not sold all my sperm to
that juggler. I can hear the bells on his shoes still, taunting me, as if
to say, "Come! Catch me if you can! I have your sperm! I shall waste it in
the casinos!" But it is not to be, for I know he is not in Vegas; many
scouts have I sent to track him, and he seems to be living in an eggplant
in the forest under the name of Mabel. All eggplants look alike to me, I
fear, and I shall never see my sperm again.
</p>

<p>But this is not the time for such complaints. This is the time for lashing
your head to a goat and scaring the neighbors, who will pelt you with gobs
of you know not what and dare not guess, and galumphing around the town
square with only one knee left visible. Rejoice! and do not issue favors to
the stinky ones, lest they return with their oils and coat you like a
butterfly, testing its wings for the first time as it flies into the bug
zapper of desire.
