<p>The Entropyneur paced around the empty club. His ghost listened to him
patiently. "You should have seen the looks on the Committee's faces when I
told them what I was going to do. They weren't happy. They tried to erase
me - I think they used almost all of their stockpile of time roaches going
after Havarti like that. It's a good thing they don't know where I was
really born. Stop looking at me like that. You know what I mean. No, I
don't think they're going to be much trouble for a while, and if they are,
hell, most of them are tankies anyway, and I know where their tanks are.
Sissy-boy has the Orrery, though, and that's tough. It's too difficult to
get back to Arcanas and make another one, so I'll have to find some way to
get it from him; it's a damn good thing he doesn't really know how to use
it."
</p>

<p>"The nice thing about all this is I know that even if I fail, I succeed,
and it doesn't matter anyway. It's time for a new way of doing business.
Out with the old, in with the new. Tabula rasa. I know, I'm starting to
babble."
</p>

<p>The Entropyneur's ghost interrupted him. "Sometimes I wish you'd just die,
you know?" he said, glaring. "I'm tired of only being halfway here. Why not
give up this immortality thing?" The Entropyneur slugged him, which was no
mean feat, considering his ghost's ethereal state.
</p>

<p>They spent the rest of the night beating each other silly.
