<title>The Way of the Hair</title>

<body>
<p>Meditate on the Way of the Hair, for a moment. The Hair toils not, neither
does it spin. It is placid even in the face of the wind. Although it may be
tormented with sprays and gels and mousses and juices, it abides. The Hair
does not fight, it does not surrender. If you cut it, it remains. If you
burn out its home with electrolysis, it returns in double measure in the
hereafter. It is always the silent victor, but it never boasts.
</p>

<p>You must be at one with the Hair, for the Hair will surely conquer, and is
it not better to be exalted with the glorious Hair than to be cast down and
trodden upon? Flatten your mind, tune your senses, unfold your personality
until the whispering Hair's tiny voice is like a deafening blast of
command. Relax until your muscles burst. Do not fear: your Hair will guide
you.
</p>

<p>The Hair will show you great mysteries. You will understand the mystic
structures embedded in the town hall in the village of Hairy Corners, and
you will know why you must, in the end, go there. But not now. The Hair has
other plans for you. Straighten up, look sharp, you've got an interview
with destiny. You're the perfect man for the job of a lifetime, and ooh,
look at that Hair. Who's your stylist? You're hired.
</p>

<p>Now try to be inconspicuous until your next set of orders come.
