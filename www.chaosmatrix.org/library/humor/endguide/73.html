<title>Action at a Distance (73)</title>

<p>The stone sat grimly in his office, stamping wicked red tongues on some
documents and smiling blue buttocks on others, as each deserved, but inside
it felt that something was dreadfully wrong. It knew it had made a wrong
turn somewhere, but it couldn't really figure out where. But that wasn't
the worst part - it had a persistent scratching in the back of its mind
that told it, in a quiet but firm voice, that none of this will have
happened, eventually.
</p>

<p>Outside, in the village, today's enactment was taking place. Hedgehogs and
other vermin dressed in strange uniforms never seen in this world were
herding imaginary people into imaginary gas chambers, pretending that they
were pretending that they were showers. The stone was particularly puzzled
by this enactment, one of the most frequent. It had asked the Committee Man
about it, and the Committee Man had said cryptically, "For some omelets,
you need a large number of eggs," and laughed in a way that disturbed the
stone greatly.
</p>

<p>The stone, however, didn't see any harm in the enactments, nor did it see
any point, really. And the Committee Man was keeping it well fed with all
kinds of exotic scones, and nobody seemed to be getting hurt. So it sat
grimly in its office, stamping documents and minding its own business, having
of course realized long ago that it could never open a tattooing parlor in
Amsterdam and just once in its life be really hip, that was just a childish
fantasy it was better off without.
