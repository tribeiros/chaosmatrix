<title>The Cricket's Tale (74)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>When I was born, which was a long time ago, but not all that long ago, I
was small, much smaller than I am now. I was also naked. I am naked now,
underneath my clothes, but when the doorbell rings, and the packages
arrive, I am also naked, and they just ask me to sign for them, they don't
even notice. I'm standing there with the claw marks of destiny on a scaly
patch of somebody else's distended abdomen just hanging from my teeth, and
they just ask me to sign for the package. So I don't think they actually
get paid very much because of that.
</p>

<p>And then in the wind that threatens to break my legs if I don't pay up the
money I owe it, I step out into the yard (still naked, but this time fully
clothed) and the crickets jump before me, thousands of them, leaping out of
my way before I crush them, leaping all over the grass.
</p>

<p>And one of them speaks, it says to me, "Did you know crickets and
cockroaches are close relatives? At least, that's what I've been led to
believe. Try squinting at them in the dark. But we're really completely
different. The roaches, they do the dirty work, they walk in the places we
dare not go. Some of them are pretty good at that. They can tear your
destiny in two before you're even born.
</p>

<p>"But we crickets, we've got the power of justice behind us. Ever read
Pinocchio? No, not the movie, the book. Yeah, we can tell you what a
bastard you are and you can kill us and we'll come straight back from the
dead to give you what for. So you had better just watch out, buddy."
