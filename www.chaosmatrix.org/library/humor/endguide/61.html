<title>Our Unkind Fate (61)</title>

<p>From frosty pinnacles of delight they come, wending down to our lowly
places where they begin their devious plan. In real estate they deploy
their minions, slurping up our desirables with nary a qualm. At first we
will enjoy it, sleeping our revelation away, but later, once the biting
begins and our veins lie open to the wind, we will laugh no more.
</p>

<p>Amid vaporous fears we try to rally against them, our legions no match for
their unity. We will retreat into the places in the earth that are of no
value, awaiting the crushing heel of the tyrant's snazzy shoes. All that
remains is an artist's rendition of the tread pattern, wavy lines and knobs
blotting out the sky and eating the sun. Our inflated bodies cry out for
puncture, an end to this dreadful pressure.
</p>

<p>As our future archeologist selves reconstruct the era, they will find the
needle in the haystack in our many-formed clientele. The shavings of our
naked souls, accreted into layers of dense fibrous tangles, will be
displayed in their museums, with inane commentaries posted on the walls.
The true nature of this horror will become obvious, however, to the
initiated among them. They will chortle in their temples, and donations will
rise substantially - for who does not wish to give money to merry folk?
</p>

<p>And in that last gleaming of ours, they will have their victory, and
through the miracle of compound interest, they will deny redemption to the
scruffy mountain whores.
