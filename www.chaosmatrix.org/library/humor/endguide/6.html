<p>Ladies and gentlemen, as we descend into the pit of unpleasant reflexes, let
me remind you that the cabin crew is ill-prepared to respond to any of your
whiny little demands, so if you would kindly refrain from dying in your
seats we shall all have a happier trip.
</p>

<p>Off to your left you will find the widely disputed "Arcade of the Drama of
Cheese". And on the - oh, sir, you'll have to stop that or I'll smite you
into oblivion. What? No, the "Yam-o-Rama" tour was the eight fifteen, this is
"Playful Jellied Preserves Of The World". No, I don't think you can have
that removed without severe trauma. Why don't you just put your
hypno-goggles back on and settle down.
</p>

<p>Ahem. And on the right, you will find a striking tableau involving Connie
Chung and one rather startled weasel! Ho-ho! I'll bet he's sorry he tried
that! We now present to you the fabled fromage of story and song, none other
than the holy preserved body of Saint Cheddar himself. Holy relics on
toothpicks will be served shortly.
</p>

<p>Thank you, I hope you've had an enjoyable tour. Any part of your body
remaining on the train after the doors close will be sold at auction.
