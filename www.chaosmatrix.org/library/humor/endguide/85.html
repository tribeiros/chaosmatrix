<title>Saving Face (85)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Study the face. It may look familiar. Does it? That could be your face, if
you had a face like that. Ah, of course; it goes without saying. Follow it,
then, if you dare. The face may lead you astray, or it may lead you to
salvation, or it may go into a place for which it has tickets and you do
not, and the only way to know is to keep up with it.
</p>

<p>What's that stuff trailing behind it? It's stringy, it's gooey, it's a load
of hooey. Gather some up, put it in your pocket, you never know when you'll
need it and pockets are made for moments like this. Feel how warm it is
against your thigh. Now, breathe deeply, fix your Hair, and slide into
town. Leave the face behind; you don't need it, after all. You're a
cruisin' dude, looking for trouble with your name on it. There's some, in
that alley, under the hobo with the godawful body odor. Roll him over and
take a look. Hey, that stench, it's not the hobo, it's the portal to the
underworld of which he is merely the gatekeeper. Hand over your load of
hooey, grease up your pants and hop on in, you're the next contestant.
</p>

<p>When you reach the bottom, you suddenly have a vision in your shoes. Their
laces reach into your mind and stir up your viscous memories, jostling
repressed names and faces and... hey, you know that face. You remember now.
It came in a box of cereal when your were a wee lad. You had many good
times together, but at last, your mother found out and she took it away
from you. All these years, she must have saved it, waiting for the day you
would be ready...
