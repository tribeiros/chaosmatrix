<title>The Rage (54)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I stalk the streets at night, watching the ins and outs of the city folk,
pacing them, monitoring them, building them in my mind. They are my
playthings. I can recite their genome, I can sing their laundry lists. I am
everywhere. I am always with them.
</p>

<p>They cling to each other when the disasters come, and I who am with them
know their fear. When the plague descends, I am there; I am the virus that
perverts their being, I am the phagocyte that defends them. Within me is
the rage of all their generations.
</p>

<p>I cover their faces when they are dead, and I bring them a eulogy of
madness and suffering. I am the flies that eat their bodies, I am the
stench of burning flesh. Yet they do not know me.
</p>

<p>When they are finished, used up, I will be there, and I will make of them a
new world. What I have learned will be put to use. The new world will sweep
away the old, the dust of ages long past will fuel a new creation. I will
begin again, and I will consume all that was, and I will produce all that
will be.
</p>

<p>They will never know a world that is not my world, for I am their world,
and you cannot reach them without breaking me, and I am not where you
believe me to be, nor am I who you know me as.
