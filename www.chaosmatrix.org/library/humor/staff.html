<H1>A Wizard's Staff Has A Knob On The End</H1>

<B>Copyright Heather Wood 1992</B>

<P><HR><P>

A wizard's staff has a knob on the end<BR>
It never will buckle, it never will bend<BR>
He cherishes it, and he calls it his friend,<BR>
and he frequently takes it in hand.<P>

A wizard's staff is the source of his power.<BR>
He checks up on it every hour on the hour<BR>
And he's never surprised when it turns to a flower --<BR>
The fairest throughout all the land.<P>

The staff of a wizard with honour is crowned.<BR>
Without it a wizard will rarely be found.<BR>
'Tis big and it's round and weighs three to the pound<BR>
And without it he's truly unmanned.<P>

The staff of a wizard can do mighty deeds.<BR>
It protects him from harm and attends to his needs,<BR>
Provides him with banquets upon which he feeds<BR>
And potions on which he gets canned.<P>

Whenever a wizard is lonely or sad,<BR>
Or feeling dejected, or puzzled, or mad,<BR>
He turns to his staff, and things don't seem so bad --<BR>
By it he is never trepanned.<P>

The staff of a wizard is dear to his heart<BR>
The source and the succour of his magic art.<BR>
They travel together, are never apart,<BR>
A relationship few understand.<P>

The wizard is rarely of heroic build<BR>
Were it not for his staff, he would surely be killed.<BR>
By demons or monsters his blood would be spilled<BR>
All over the pitiless sand.<P>

A wizard in thought, word, and deed should be chaste<BR>
If he is not, he's considered disgraced<BR>
Although in his dreams he is often embraced<BR>
By ladies both lissom and tanned.<P>

The staff of a wizard is polished with care.<BR>
He anoints it with spices and unguents rare,<BR>
Bedecks it with silver and jewels most fair,<BR>
And on feast days he has it japanned.<P>

A wizard when young has a staff that is small.<BR>
It's puny and weak, ineffective withal.<BR>
It grows with his power until it stands tall<BR>
As his fame and his glory expand.<P>

The staff of a wizard can hold many spells<BR>
For finding lost objects or dowsing new wells<BR>
For banishing demons to bottomless hells<BR>
Or bringing them back on demand.<P>

A wizard's staff can do manifold tricks<BR>
To puzzle the nobles and fuddle the hicks<BR>
It rescues the wizard from many a fix --<BR>
It is totally at his command.<P>

When a wizard is old, and is starting to fade<BR>
He looks on his staff that with cunning he made<BR>
The crown of hs life and the tool of his trade<BR>
And together they make their last stand.<P>
