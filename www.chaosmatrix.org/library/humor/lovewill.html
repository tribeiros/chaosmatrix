As everyone knows:
"Possession is nine tenths of the law."
and
"Love is the law, love under will."

ThereforE, love in terms of will and possession can be shown as follows:

1.
                            9 x Law           Will
               Possession = -------     &     ---- = Law
                              10              Love
Solve for love as follows:

2.
             10 x Possession = 9 x Law  &   Will = Law x Love
3.
                     10 x Possession                 Will
               Law = ---------------    &     Love = ----
                            9                        Law
4.    Therefore,
                                      Will
                        Love = -------------------
                                 10 x Possession
                                 ---------------
                                        9
5.    Which can be simplified to:

                                    9 x Will
                          Love = ---------------
                                 10 x Possession

Here we succinctly see what many have suspected: the more stuff you have,
the less love you have.  Even if Will increases at a rate equal to
that of Possession, Love will still gradually erode.  One will note,
however, that if all Possession is discarded, Love becomes an undefined,
unbounded and perfectly mysterious value which aproaches infinity,
as many a mystic has thought.

Therefore,

Send your possessions to:
