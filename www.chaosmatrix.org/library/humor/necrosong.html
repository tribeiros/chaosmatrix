<H1>There Ain't No Necronomicon!</H1>

Every few years you will see<BR>
An ad as well writ as can be!<BR>
Offering for sale a book. . .<BR>
Whose title is the selling hook.<P>

It's called the Necronomicon<BR>
To summon horrors from beyond. . .<BR>
Or so 'twas claimed by H.P.L.. . .<BR>
Writ by an Arab 'mad as hell!<P>

The author, poor Abdul Alhazred,<BR>
Was 'et by demons in Damascus --<BR>
And how his book survived,<BR>
Don't ask us!<P>

Lovecraft's fans both far and near<BR>
Have searched for many a fruitless year<BR>
To find this book of evil spells<BR>
But the truth is sad to tell. . .<P>

THERE AIN'T NO NECRONOMICON !<P>

There is a Key of Solomon<BR>
And a Lesser Key, Lemegeton.<BR>
There's a Grimorie of Honorius<BR>
And other works notorious. . .<P>

Heptameron, Enchiradon,<BR>
Complete with Tetragrammaton. . .<BR>
But there ain't no Necronomicon --<BR>
Of that we have no doubt!<P>

There's Aramadel and Arbatel<BR>
And other catalogs of hell. . .<BR>
There's Picatrix (not pick up sticks!)<BR>
And other books of dirty tricks!<P>

There's manuscripts quite Faus-tee-on<BR>
And Tablets in Eno-kee-on<BR>
But there ain't no Necronomicon,<BR>
And that's a simple fact!<P>
