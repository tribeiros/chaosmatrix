<HR><P>

I bet you were afraid I'd actually do it, weren't you?<P>

----------<P>

Keep ravin', ravin', ravin',<BR>
There's drugs that I am cravin',<BR>
Keep them dancers ravin', ravehide!<BR>
I'm rollin' and I'm trippin',<BR>
They call it candy-flippin',<BR>
It's something that I hadn't ever tried.<BR>
With E and speed and acid,<BR>
I'm anything but placid,<BR>
And now I couldn't sit still if I tried.<P>

Shoot it up, suck it down,<BR>
Breathe it in, spit it out,<BR>
Bring it on, pump it up, ravehide!<BR>
smoke it up, drink it down,<BR>
snort it in, chew it up,<BR>
shoot it up, break it down, ravehiiiiiiiiiide!<P>

Keep dancin', dancin', dancin',<BR>
With eyes like Charlie Manson,<BR>
Keep them ravers dancin', ravehide!<BR>
I smell like Marlon Brando<BR>
Doin' the fandango,<BR>
But I don't care because my brain is fried.<BR>
My face has turned to Jell-o,<BR>
The lobster's feeling mellow,<BR>
And this glowstick that I found will be my bride.<P>

Freakin' out, pick it up,<BR>
Put it down, bark it on,<BR>
Move ahead, scrim it back, ravehide!<BR>
Cut it up, beep it low,<BR>
Hide the cow, shoot the cop,<BR>
Freakin' out, lick the moon, ravehiiiiiiiiiide!<P>

RAVEHIDE!<P>
