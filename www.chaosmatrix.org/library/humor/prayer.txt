An excellent post! For further evidence of the power of humor, read "The
Book; On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are", by Alan Watts

I recited this prayer at a friend's funeral a few years ago:
Great God of Comedy,
You who fling custard pies in the Demon's face,
You who set whoopee cushion upon the Throne of Heaven,
To You I pray;
Grant that I may see the humor
And find the joke
Where others see only sadness and sorrow.
Grant that I may never take myself
Or my situation seriously.
And let me laugh the Laugh
That will crack the sky
And shake Heaven and Earth.
This we ask in the name of all that is funny.

...at that point, the deceased's Catholic family members all spontaneously
responded "Amen".

The only dangerous idea is the idea that there are such things as
dangerous ideas.
