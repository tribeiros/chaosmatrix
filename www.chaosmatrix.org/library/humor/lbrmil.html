<H1>The Lesser* Banishing Ritual<BR>
of Thee Mother-Inlaw</H1>
<B>[The Greater ritual being to terrible even for the worst of inlaws]</B>
<H3>by James Lin</H3>

In the double current of Maat/Horus,the dis-banding of Nirvana and the
age of the new Goddess, Alanis Morrissett, do I type these words, 'tis
true, without a word of lie, 'tis very true. That which is on the
z-list is online, and that which is online, is on the z-list, to work
boredom from. And just as all things have been, and are come from,
Shub internet, so are all e-mails born of this one thing. And so it
goes.....<P>

 As I lay in my chamber, exausted from another day, my Ladywife and
child beside me, I did hear a stirring coming from yonder."Hark", I
said, I usually don't say Hark, but it makes for a better story, "Hark",
I said, "What is that noise from kitchen yonder?"<P>

I crawled from the safety of my warm nest and reached for my weapon. I
spoke the secret words as taught to me by my mentor, Mr. Rogers.<P>

"Oh mighty Mjollnir, basher of burglars, at any other time thy name be
golfclub, defend me now in your grandest "hole in one" style. I invoke
thee Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicholas, and Lee Trevino. Lee, your not that
great of a golfer, but you were struck by lightning." I felt the
powerglow of Mjollnir creep through my body, or it might have just
been heartburn from to much pizza before bed, I'm not sure. Feeling
bold,I took four antacid tablets with extra calcium and crept down the
stairs to the cavern we call the kitchen. There before me hunched over
a pot of some incongruent mass, was, to my horror, Thee Mother in Law!<P>

I quickly said my silent invocation to the God  "Nike Adidas" and the
silent incantation "Feets don't fail me now"  but she turned and saw
me before I could run away. The stench of too much Opium and Morning
Dew perfume assaulted my senses, I almost passed out from the smell. I
shook my head to clear my throbbing brain, and saw her moving toward
me, a spoon in one hand and the pot in the other.<P>

Thinking as quickly as I could I shouted "Get thee behind me mother in
law. Oh yea, forcer of unwanted food, pincher of my young son's
cheeks. Take your pots of alcohol chicken and your silly folk
superstitions and begone."<P>

And she that moved spake,  "We are the Mother in Laws and we are many,
we move into your home in the well meaning guise of nutritional needs,
but in reality we come to cause strife. Our famous curse "support the
babies head" will ring in your ears till the day you die."<P>

The odor of garlic and Polident was almost too much to bear. I was frozen
in place, forced to listen to her complaining diatribe.<P>

She continued " I hurl upon ye, parents that love your children and
would keep them. We the Mother in laws manifest in many forms, one of
those forms being "The well meaning friend."<P>

I had had enough, I knew if I didn't stop this horror now, it would be
too late. I rose up and spoke the revered names of Gods an Goddesses
most hated by Thee Mother in Law.<P>

"I invoke thee Led Zeppelin, fall upon this Legion and take it from my
site. In through the out door, if you will. And also the curse called
"The well meaning friend." Those vile childless beings that somehow
know EVERYTHING about how to rear MY child. Jimi Hendricks wail upon
your guitar with extra feedback and distortion, Janis Joplin rip one
out and sonically banish this blot on human kind.<P>

Then I spoke my best and most sacred barbarous name incantation, that
of Cheech and Chong " Oh Feely me bony belly e probiscus e Billy selly
all of his dominoes."<P>

And with that Thee Mother in Law packed her bags and left my dwelling,
vowing never to return.<P>

Somehow, I doubted it.<P>
