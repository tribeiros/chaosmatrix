4.01.1 - i'm back!

Well, it has been a long time. many changes have occured in my
existence since thee last time i edited a TRANSMISSION.
when TRANSMISSION 0.75 came out in November of 1990, i had no idea
what changes and growth were in store, both for me and thee Temple.
i am pleased that TOPY has been there for me during this time. i hope
i can always be around in the future when thee Temple needs my help.

i'd also like to thank C131 for keeping TRANSMISSIONS alive, thru
my periods of net drought and other times. i hope i can help
return the favor, and keep the output up to the same standard.

there are other changes that would have been out of the realm of
possibilty just a few months ago:

        * TOPY will have its own Internet site by next months TRANSMISSION.
        * TOPY will open more Action Points in 1994 than ever before.
        * more TOPY material will be available online.
        * TOPY will begin to take a more public role in sharing it tenets.

Many of these changes are directly possible because of the evolution
that TOPY has had to undergo after the decision to seperate our activities
from the activities of Psychic TV. In retrospect, thee Network can see
that that decision, however hard it was, was the right one!
1994 is the year that TOPY "comes of age". Psychick Youth, all grown up!
stay tuned....

From 'Thee Definitions ov Psychick Youth'
Published in BROADCAST issue 4/5, 1993

* Manifestation of an enhanced and focused perception developed by creating
a state of mind where the intuitive/creative faculties of the subconscious
mind can interrelate with the ordinary state of consciousness, thus
normally suppressed and/or ignored data can be analyzed or used in a
constructive manner to assist in one's personal evolutionary path. Psychick
is to psychic what magick is to magic. Lack of the 'k' usually implies
sleight-of-hand 'hocus-pocus' tricks.
* PSY- 23rd letter of the Greek alphabet CHI- daoism - great breath, the
soul, life.
* The deliberate modification of the Self by internal means, influencing
one's behavior through thought, meditation, analysis. In the equation 'as
above, so below', psychick magick would be affecting 'below', the
microcosm.
* The term itself can be taken to imply paranormally talented young people,

4.01.3 - COYOTE DANCING IN A NEW Y-ERA

As thee focus ov thee recent Event hosted by TOPY TERRA, there was a
Ball-Dance...in which E actively participated...E was thee first to
finish stringing my tangellos and bells [six ov each]...and carrying them to
thee piercing area...i was greated by thee master piercer..."Are all ov
those for you?", he asked smiling devilishly...E said, "Yes.", to which
he repied that we should begin with me...thee actual piercing did not
feel as painful as E thought it would, but thee weight upon these fresh
"wounds" was much more painful than E expected...finally after waiting
for fourteen others to be pierced by thee three piercers present...WE
moved out into thee underground tunnel in which we had gathered, formed a
circle and chanted...thee drumming began...moving was painful at first...
but quickly thee Endorphines kicked in...thee weights upon my back tugged
in such a way that it felt as if E had wings...flying is an accurate
descriptor ov my Experience...E did not notice thee first couple ov balls
to fall off...but when thee final ball flew off...E was englufed in a
tidal wave ov Pure Pleasure...that filled me with such JOY that E felt
far too big for that bunker...or for this world...at that moment E
Empowered my Sigil which consisted ov verbal and somatic parts...
each ov us dance together...but each for our own goals...after each ov us
had finished dancing...we gathered in a circle...holding hands...allowing
thee Energy to flow through sweating blood streaked bodies...chanting...
or just breathing...allowing our"selves" to get used to this world again...

Rainbow Queers, thee Family...in a rather impromptu way, based on some
loose ideas, TOPY LUNA led a KALI Rite, in which some 50 allies
particpated...WE explained that we were wanting to Evoke KALI, so as to
shed from our lives whatever we had been carrying around for thee last
y-era that was no longer useful like a snake sheds its old skin...we called
thee quarters, Evoking Elementals while focusing upon thee coresponding
regions ov thee Body...a Magickal Ally read a passage about thee GODDESS
[in thee first person]...E described HER powers ov destruction/creation
while my brothers c236 & c25 distributed pieces ov a 15' snake shed for
people to focus upon that object what they desired to shed from their lives
and while c236 danced within and shed a red tube ov clothe as a visual
example ov thee Emotional process in which we were engaged...we chanted
"SHE IS DARKNESS COMING INTO LIGHT!"...c236 led us out beneatth thee
Night Sky and we gathered around thee bon fire...at which time/place E
instructed those gathered to fling into thee Fire thee snake shed along
with that which we wished to shed from our lives, but only when they were
really ready to let it go...i blew a horn thrice and asked those who
participated to sometime that night look up into HER Darkness ov thee
Night Sky and say thanks for a freshly plowed field upon which new seeds
may be flung...

4.01.5 - The Naming Of An Age
By: al677@cleveland.Freenet.Edu
USA, 1992

Here we are, all in this together, plummeting helter-skelter toward a new
century, a new millennium, a new Age, and it's not too early to begin
thinking about what we shall call it. The naming of an Age is not something
to be taken lightly, after all, and if we wait too long we will eventually
lose the right to name our new Age ourselves, leaving the task to some
post-historic nerd who has no real feel for just what it is that makes us
tick. It is important that we name our Age now, while it is fresh and clear
in our minds.

We give names to Ages in history on the basis of some characteristic which,
from our point of view, is a significant and central aspect of a culture.
The name should be short and convenient, and should evoke an immediate
image of what the times were like, while carrying a specific and unique
flavor that distinguishes this Age from all others. It is also important to
note that Ages have been coming closer and closer together lately -- the
Industrial Age, the Atomic Age, the Space Age, the Electronic Age, the
Computer Age, the Information Age, all rushing down on us in a hailstorm of
historical importance until they overlap and blur together like the pages
of a cartoon flipbook. Our new Age should have a name that is truly
distinctive, that sets it apart from mere technological labels and touches
the core of our place in cultural history. A name that immediately
identifies the essence of who and what we are.

Bearing all of this in mind, I suggest that we christen our new Age 'The
T-Shirt Age.'

Before you scoff and sneer, consider the evidence. What specific aspect of
our culture could better represent who we are as a people, our tastes, our
art, our politics, our world view, our philosophy? You may think that the
T-Shirt is a trite and banal image, undignified and unfit for the grand
purpose of identifying an entire Age of history. And perhaps it is trite.
But do not dismiss it out of hand solely for that reason.

Think of the symbolism here. The very nature of the T-shirt illustrates our
place in history with eloquence. It represents our penchant for
off-the-rack, mass-produced, interchangeable personalities, slipped on
easily and worn with smug arrogance. Who we are is encapsulated in our
T-shirts, whether plain and bland or adorned with caricatures, aphorisms,
profanity or meaningless patterns. We have no need to develop complexities
of soul and mind; our views on any subject can be stated in a cartoon and a
caption, emblazoned on our proud, out-thrust chests. Our politics and ways
of life are slogans and jingoisms of twelve words or less: if it can't be
read on a T-shirt from across the room, it's too complex to bother with.
The ever popular 'Shit Happens' T-shirt is a poetically concise, eloquent
expression of our apathetic indifference to the constant slings and arrows
of our outrageous world, and our firm belief that there's nothing we can do
about it anyway.

Our infatuation with amusing ourselves and our adoration of entertainers --
actors, rock groups, sports figures, religious and political leaders -- are
epitomized by the T-shirt. We strut our likes and dislikes publicly and
uninvited, advising all who cross our paths that we love Hulk Hogan and
Freddy Kreuger, Axel Rose or Vanna White, Jimmy Swaggart, Ronald McDonald,
or Hot Babes With Bodacious Hooters.

The T-shirt crosses all social lines. Everyone wears them, from factory
worker to clergyman to teenager to executive. The one-sizefits-all
mentality is the perfect representation of our homogeneity, our distaste
for individuality, our distrust of anything different, and our passion for
imposing equality at the expense of excellence. T-shirts know no
boundaries. Age, occupation, economic status, race, gender, physical
condition: T-shirts are the same for everyone.

T-shirts are fashionably informal, and we are a culture obsessed with
fashion and disdainful of formality. We wear them to work, to play, to
church and to socialize, to make an impression and to make love. They're
universally accepted, and acceptance is of paramount importance to us.

We are a wash-n-wear culture, a society on the go, in love with
convenience. You can change from your work T-shirt to your tennis T-shirt
to your going-out-to-dinner T-shirt without losing more than a moment of
your valuable time. The T-shirt requires virtually no care or attention.
They do wear out periodically, but then, so do our ideals, and you can pick
up new ones at any drug store or corner gas mart. They're cheap, easy,
disposable; simply toss them aside and don another. It'll stretch to fit
anything, giving it some resemblance to our belief in political speeches
and the national debt.

So despite the misgivings you may have had, you can surely see that the
T-shirt is a remarkably appropriate emblem for our Age. One might even say
it suits us to a T.
