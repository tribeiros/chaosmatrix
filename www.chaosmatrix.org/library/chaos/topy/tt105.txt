2)A poem by CHRISTUS 777

it is time
to start a fire
it is time
to pull taut
the wire
a purge for hire

let's walk
the tightrope higher
into the clouly skies
of desire

3)  Chaos by Hakim Bey  

Chapter One:  CHAOS

Chaos never died.

Primordial uncarved block, sole worshipful monster, inert & spontaneous,
more ultraviolet than any mythology (like the shadows before Babylon),
the originall undifferentiated oneness-of-being still radiates serene as
the balck pennants of Assassins, random & perpetually intoxicated.

Chaos comes before all principles of order & entropy, it's neither a god
nor a maggot, its idiotic desires encompass & define every possible 
choreography, all meaningless aethers & phlogicstons:  its masks are 
crystallizations of its own facelessness, like clouds.

Everything in nature is perfectly real including consciousness, there' 
absolutely nothing to worry about.  Not only have the chains of the Law
been broken, they never existed; demons never guarded the stars, the
Empire never got started, Eros never grew a beard.

No listen, what happened was this:  they lied to you, sold you ideas of
good & evil, gave you distrust of your body & shame for your prophethood
of chaos, invented words of disgust for your molecular love, mesmerized
you with inattention, bored you with civilization & all its usurious emotions.

There is no becoming, no revolution, no struggle, no path; already
you're the monarch of your own skin -your inviolable freedom waits to 
be completed only by the love of other monarchs:  a politics of dream,
urgent as the blueness of sky. 

To shed all the illusory rights & hesitations of history demands the
ecoonomy of some legendary Stone Age -shamans not priests, bards not
lords, hunters not police, gatheres of paleolithic laziness, gentle as
blood, going naked for a sign or painted as birds, pised on the wave 
of explicit presence, the clockless nowever.

Agents of chaos cast burning glances at anything or anyone capable of
bearing witness to their condition, their fever of lux et voluptas.  I
am awake only in what I love & desire to the pint of terror -everything
else is just shrouded furniture, quotidian anaesthesia, shit-for-brains, 
sub-reptilian ennui of totalitarian regimes, banal censorship & useless pain.

Avatars of chaos act as spies, saboteurs, criminals of amour fou,
neither selfless nor selfish, accessible as children, mannered as
barbarians, chafed with obsessions, unemployed, sensually deranged, 
wolfangels, mirrors for contemplation, eyes like flowers, pirated of 
all signs & meanings.

Here we are crawling the cracks betweeen walls of church state school 
& factory, all the paranoid monoliths.  Cut off from the tribe by 
feral nostalgia we tunnel after lost words, imaginary bombs.

The last possible DEED is that wich defines perception itself, an
invisible folden cord that connects us:  illegal dancing in the
courthouse corridors.  If I were to kiss you here they'd call it an act
of terrorism -so let's take our pistols to bed & wake up the city at
midnight like drunken bandits celebrating with a fusillade, the message
of the taste of chaos.

4)"from someone about their experiences with scentologists..."

IN MY NOTSO HUMBLE OPINION: Scientology is the biggest bunch of bullshit
mind-bending brainwashing anyone has ever encountered!  Now People: THIS IS MY
PERSONAL OPINION! So don't bother to flame because I won't respond.

I used to go to a film production college in Boston Mass. back in 1972-1974.
My ride home to Lowell, Mass. was late that day so I stopped in for grins and
giggles to the local Scientology POW camp.  They brought me in and gave me the
standard rap about how we are all "mentally unhealthy" until we go through
a "cleansing" process. They then told me to grab onto these two tin cans
and they would ask me bot "ugly" and "beautiful" questions like:

How do you feel about a nuclear explosion?
How do you feel about a sunny peaceful day in the country side?
etc ad nauseum.........

The tin cans were soldered to wires that were connected to a meter. Before he
could ask me these questions, he was called out for 5 minutes.  I used to
be a technician: electronics that is.  I checked out the meter and what it 
was .... was a shunted ammeter.  An ammeter (or amp meter) registers the amount
of current going through an electronic circuit.  A "shunted ammeter" has a few
resistors added to it so that it will be able to measure amps in the "micro amp"
range.  When you tense your muscle structure, you will usually produce a very 
tiny current of electricity n the palms of your hands.  AND, the cans were
Campbell soup cans!!!!! I tensed my hands and made the meter moved. When I 
relaxed them, the meter went back to 0.  

The yoyo came back and started to ask me these loaded questions. To every "ugly"
question I would be relaxed and show no emotion on the meter...which meant that
I enjoyed the thought of say a nuclear explosion.  To the beautiful questions
I would tense out to the max.....eventually he thought that I was Charly Manson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had fun!!!!!!!!

I then proceeded to stand up on the desk and started
to explain what they were doing to their minds!!!! 6 people believed me ... 
laughed and left. Then two guys, about 6'5" at 250lbs. got me, one on each arm
...brought me to the front door.....and literally threw me 20 feet before I 
landed on the pavement! I haven't had that much fun since!!!!!!!!

5)  An Excerpt from thee GREY BOOK

Established orthodoxies and dogmas, conditioned interpretations of
living, regard the material world as reality whilst pretending to deal
with the spirit or existence.  They conceive and propagate evolution 
and thinking as purely physical, their control of our visions as
sacrosanct.  Religion has privately altered to work from a position 
that accepts itself as totally discredited by science.  All
establishment modes of control and affiliation both religious and
political, rely upon and revolve around unquestioning faith and dogma, 
unquestioning acceptance of their inalienable right to assume
professional responsibility for our actions upon their shoulders.  We
are told we are weak, incapable of grasping scale, afraid of ourselves
and desperate to push responsibility for all events in our lives onto
them.  We are insistently trained to accept  our corporeal existence 
as hopeless in itself, to becoum subservient to the greater good.  We
are perpetually conditioned, encouraged, and blackmailed into 
self-restriction into narrower and narrower perceptions of ourselves,
our own importance, our own potential and our own experience.  We are 
trained to ignore the evidence of our senses and experiences and to 
feel guilt when we glempse sense derived visions of ourselves as 
free spirits. 

The voluntary relinquishing of responsibility for our lives and actions
is one of the greatest enemies of our times.

6)  What does 666 mean to YOU?

Vale- "What does 666 mean to you?"

Genesis P-Orridge-  "Actually, we've done some research into that with
Z'ev, who's much better at cabalistic and numerological matters than I
am.  He broke down the Mark of the Beast cabalistically; he took 666 
and discovered it means SOMA or somatic:  the body, but also the 
magic mushrooms which were psychedelic; the mark identifying which
mushrooms a shaman could use for further progression.  In other words,
it's KNOWLEDGE again, like the apple in the Garden of Eden.  Which makes
a lot more sense to me..."

What does 666 mean to YOU?
