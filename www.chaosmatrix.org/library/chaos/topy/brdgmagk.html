<H1>Bridge Magick</H1>

<P>
<HR><P><HR>

Even before I became consciously involved in Magick the
underside of bridges always produced very unusual mental
states. These were interesting but I wanted to see if I
could come up with something more systematic/useful
involving bridges.<P>

The bridge is a structure which can seem abandoned although
still in use by traffic. Under a bridge there are columns
and slopes and whatever else the terrain consists of,
perhaps a river. The point is to redefine the use of the
bridge, take over psychick structures. This lack of use
parallels the role magickal information is placed in todays
society- the unused parts of our brain. Under certain
bridges there is a feeling of stepping past the usual
confines of the social/historical model daily life is
crippled under.<P>

The Scandinavians had trolls, magickal beings who lived in
tunnels and under bridges. You don't actually have to live
under a bridge or inside a subway tunnel to make use of them
in a ritual. Why should the magician have any resemblance to
robed figures carrying wands and tracing pentagrams,
especially since so many have covered this area before?
Finding something that works for you is the most important
part, the figuring out can come later. Everyone has
something unique to themselves and their situation that can
be used in a ritual. Redefining and personalizing found junk
is another suggested technique along these lines (scrap
metal, abandoned electronics, used packaging, dead animals).<P>

When I started becoming obsessed with bridges one of the
things I did was to paint graffitti on supporting columns.
These were highly charged, very personal images which came
spontaneously at the site. I did all sorts of strange things
after that, the images seemed to unleash all sorts of wild
energy. Later I heard about the function of totems in
certain tribes and how it related to growing up in a tribal
society - rites involving the transference of the youth's
soul to his totem. This accomplishes the "death" of the
youth. With infusion of life from the totem the youth's
system gradually recovers. Each time I returned to my
graffitti/totems it seemed I was tapping into some powerful
timeless energy. It was as if I was drawing information
through the drawing itself from the perceptions of the
bridge. The bridge was a reservoir. Perhaps the whole valley
system in which I found these bridges, carved and shaped
unconsciously by city planners and developers, is a
contemporary equivalent of the totems of aboriginal tribes.
The "information society" contains an intelligence most of
its "cells" are unaware of. Ritual use of the outdoors seems
natural in North America. For me, growing up in Canada, the
outside has always held a strong magnetism. In Europe it's
probably quite difficult to find areas to conduct private
rituals outside, practically impossible in cities. Most
North American cities, on the other hand, have generous
tracts of land allocated for parks, etc.<P>

Taking the plunge. Jumping off bridges has always been a
popular way to commit suicide, reinforcing the image of the
bridge as a gateway between different worlds. In Carlos
Casteneda's books on Yaqui Indian magic jumping off a cliff
was a major initiation - you either assembled yourself at a
different location or you died (or if you were a very
advanced seer you would disappear into another dimension).<P>

Of course there is a reason why most "normal" people would
rather jump off a bridge than conduct a ritual under one.
The Roman word pontifex, from which Pontif originates, means
"buider of bridges". A pope was meant to be a bridge between
two worlds. On the other side of the good/evil coin devils
were reputed to particularly enjoy taking part in the
construction of bridges back in the Middle Ages (for payment
in cats). The Israelites made the bridge into a sign of the
Covenant between god and his people, and in China it was the
sign denoting the union of heavan and earth.<P>

Can a figurehead really be YOUR bridge? T.O.P.Y Canada is
not a substitute religion, it is a receptive place for
experiences and ideas which would otherwise have no place,
no place in modern society and no place in a culture which
exalts itself above organic processes. Here we can reclaim
ourselves and reject the fossilized totems of power, money
and fear inherited from the past.<P>

565. This 19th century popular print represents a bishop by
the name of Saint Cado offering a cat to the devil as a
means of thanking him for the building of a bridge. The
reward is modest, even ridiculous but ordinary people like
to let the devil whistle for his money: popular morality
insists that we should have the right to destroy 'outlaws'.<P>

563-564. It was also said that devils particularly enjoyed
taking part in the building of bridges. Psychologists of
today will not fail to note that in the scientific
interpretation of dreams the symbolic significance of the
bridge theme is that of surmounting a difficulty. The
picture above (563) shows the Valentre Bridge at Cahors
which, according to legend, was the work of the devil. The
Bridge of Saint-Cloud (564) near Paris is also supposed to
owe its existence to Satan.<P>
