1)Editors' statement..
 Well, for those that have not heard, change is afoot in thee Net-work. In
this issue we have a letter from Tom Hallewell, formerly Coyote 12, a
guiding force in TOPY NA over thee past five years.

He has decided to give up thee responsibility ov heading thee North American
Station in order to concentrate on his Ratio One work.

We applaud his courage and his commitment to inner growth. It often coums
to many 'magickal' organizations that thee leadership becoums so wrapped
up in thee process ov running the GROUP that they lose track ov their OWN
growth, and end up living and teaching a lie. Tom has shown that in TOPY,
this too is different.

We hope that those called to take up thee Work that Tom left behind will
take his example and will not allow the apparent 'power' [ha ha] that they
may get to obscure or even deaden their own Ratio One work. 

We dedicate this issue, with L-ov-E, to Tom. Your work will not be
forgotten.

l-ov-e: Coyote 129 & Coyote 131  

ps: next moonth - thee return ov CHAOS!

2)  NOTICE OV TERMINATION OV TOPY STATION DENVER
After five yeras ov running thee North America Station, E (Coyote 12) have
made thee difficult decision to decrease my level ov involvement in thee
Network. After much thought, E have coumcluded that for my own growth, it
is necessary to do more Ratio One work, and less Broadcasting. Thee causes
for this decision are multiple, let it suffice for me merely to say that E do
not see this as an end to my involvement or work within TOPY; it is simply a
lowering ov Network-related workload, in order for me to have thee time
and money to pursue other interests and long term goals.

TOPY SOL have agreed to take over thee Station; this will be effective
immediately. All litters sent to this Station will be automatically
forwarded to thee SOL address.

E apologize to all ov you for not replying to any mail for thee last several
months; E have had many personal issues to deal with, and thee time and
inclination just have not been there for me to put thee effort E feel that
your litters deserve.

This will be thee beginning ov a new era within TOPY NA; please be patient
with TOPY SOL, they really have no idea what they have gotten themselves
into!

TOPY TEXAS will, at coum point in thee near future, be taking over thee
merchandising section ov TOPY. Any orders that have already been made
through Denver will be honored and taken care ov by DENVER. Please wait
until TEXAS gives the green light before flooding them with orders and
inquires; again, thee transition will take time. Bear with us all.

We still aren't sure what to do with thee World Domination Club; butter for
thee time being, it will remain here in Denver, and ought to have a new
mailer out in a relatively short time.

E thank all ov you for your support, enthusiasm and patience over thee last
five yeras, our association  will be a memory that E will always cherish. E
feel that thee changes will be very positive for thee Network; thee de-
centralization that many ov you clamored for is upon us.

As for myself, E am relinquishing thee Temple Name Coyote 12, and
destroying all sigils performed under that name. E desire to begin a new
phase in my involvement with TOPY, and that will be under a new Temple
Name, assigned by thee new Station.

Anyone wishing to maintain contact with me can feel free to do so, in care
ov thee WDC, whose address is in thee last few CCTs. Be forewarned that E
will not discuss thee affairs ov thee former Station, or my reasons for
terminating it.

with deep L-ov-E, Tom Hallewell, formerly Coyote 12.

[ note: the address ov TOPY SOL is : Box 33540, San Diego, CA 92163 USA ]

DEATH POEM OF A SAMURAI

Toshimoto took out of his robe a scroll of paper and, after wiping his
neck with it, spread it out and wrote his death poem:

   From ancient times the saying comes, 
   "There is no death; there is no life."
   Indeed, the skies are cloudless
   And the river waters clear.

Toshimoto then laid down his brush and smoothed his hair with his hand. 
At that very moment, the blade of the sword flashed behind him;  his
head fell forward and his body followed, covering the head.

I just finished reading Mishima's SUN & STEEL a lengthy essay on the 
inadequacy of words...Tzara, Gysin and Burroughs also are disgruntled with
the inadequacy of words, all four are writers by profession...and all four
are trying different ways of communicating there experience to 
others via words...Burroughs pointed out the problem with words...which is 
that to read a little voice must read the words...this little voice is inside
our head...and thus the agents of control infiltrate our minds by us
reading there propaganda...by reading a sign or headline, etc. my own
inner voice speaks those written words...thus i may believe them as 
true because my own little voice spoke to me...there is a scholarly 
book which Burroughs often quotes from on this subject...the title and
author escapes me at the time...but such verbalizing of writing leads 
to discursive thought...the noisy, unattractive thoughts of us/them, 
here/there, subject/object, mine/other...Burroughs suggested stopping
this "voice of authority" by using language based on pictures
...ideally hieroglyphics...but chinese and japanese charachters
are based on pictures also..."sunset" is written by juxtaposing the
symbol for "sun" which looks like the sun with that of "tree" which
looks like a tree...thus the word "sunset" looks like a sunset...the 
sun just on the horizon behind a tree...and Mishima (who writes in
japanese) still found this inadequate to communicate properly...for 
him action was the only pure communication...action as symbol? 
a single perfect note from a bamboo flute which induces enlightenment....
holding a single flower aloft...cutting an apple in two to actualize 
its center...Mishima denies that action is a symbol for anything else...
an action undifiled by discursive thought...that is an action as it
really is...pure action=pure consciousness...so what did Mishima
communicate by his seppuku (ritual suicide)?  i am skeptickal as to any
real comunication...i fall back on the Zen saying that there is 
"Nothing to do, nothing to say, nothing to know."
 
Any thoughts on this subject would be appreciated...
 
   somewhere suspended
between the sky & the sea
   nowhere else to be

 We will pitch our tents in the campfire of the Lord and offer up sacrifices 
of live scientists.  It will be a happy time. Embossers will live off the 
fat of the land.  The lion and the cow and the hippy chick will lie down 
in a field of poppies; their little machetes will do them no good.

 You and i will breathe helium and go to wake them up before too long.

 La, mister lion!  Wake up!  La, mistress hippy chick! We will lead them, 
in their drowsy state, to the zeppelin hangar.  We will induce them to don 
the special gutta-percha flight suits that will protect them from the 
terrible high-altitude phlogiston winds.

 At this height, geography is not so cumbersome.  It becomes apparent that 
office building lights are pixels in fatbits mode illuminating the whorls and 
arches peculiar to fingerprints. Our little mammalian brains are racing very 
quickly now, threatening an unsettling revelation.  The helium-enhanced voices
 on the intercom do not soothe any longer.  The pulse of blood in our ears 
slams against our eardrums.  The last thing we remember is Mister Lion holding 
the test instruments in the phlogiston wind.  He is leaning far out of the 
gondola.  Fat blue phlogiston sparks are creeping up the handle towards him. 
Suddenly we can see valves and relays inside the instruments; it seems that 
their titanium panels have developed transparent splotches where they face 
the wind.

 The moth-baby shook violently and woke up one of the guards. This one rolled 
across the wide lawn toward her, pushing her back in the cage.  She cried.  
She got sick.  It was very quiet, and the moth-baby imagined that the whole 
world could hear her vomit.

 Then she stopped vomiting and began dry-retching.  She did not find this much
 more pleasant.  Her abdomen was very tired, and she wanted very much to sleep.
  Sometimes she dozed off, but she always awoke in convulsions, trying to 
throw up the contents of her empty moth-belly.

 Just before dawn, she coughed up a piece of track from a main battle tank.  
That was the first.  Every few minutes she retched, and sometimes something 
would come up.  The first day there was the tank track, a napkin dispenser, 
some rebar and a stapler. 
 The next day, things seemed to come out even faster. She worried that her 
cage might fill up, and she would be forced out, which would attract the 
guards.  By the third day, she had a poinsettia, a volleyball net, a 
translucent plastic glove, a tennis trophy, christmas tree lights, lumps of 
paraffin, a sled, a pinecone, a Miami transit map, brushed aluminum drawer 
handles, an eyeglass repair kit, ceramic insulators, a Kawasaki clutch cable, 
an empty Ramones CD jewel box, a pair of safety scissors, a wasabi root, 
saxophone reeds, a Barbie-sized oxygen mask, sand, worry beads, a scarab 
beetle, a circular saw blade, semaphore flags, a bakelite scotty dog, 
fishing sinkers, cheese seals, a portable phonograph, a dowsing rod, 
sugarcane, a bottle rocket, a lawn chair and a stuffed giraffe.

 She tried and tried to cough up a curved metal box inscribed 
"front towards enemy", but could not control her talent.

 Our tormentors are always the most sympathetic.  Especially the Etruscans, 
with their moist pink snouts and cleverly woven hair extensions.  I remember 
them floating face-down in the fountain by my favorite restaurant.  I was 
fifteen, and i was trying out my new electronic stud finder.  I remember 
them taking me to an all-night recycling center.  Someone was whistling 
Bridge Over the River Kwai.  I remember them having spongy hands, with 
fingers that came off when you bit them.

 They wanted me to tell them about disaster models, they had all kinds of 
pictures of flood, hurricane, accident victims.  I don't think they believed 
that I couldn't get them calendars and t-shirts; it was hard to tell what 
they meant or what they wanted
.  They videotaped me, asking me if I had ever been in a fire, a flood, 
anything.  Then they insisted I make something up, talk about how my home was 
destroyed by earthquakes.

 They kept saying oh, how terrible when the camera was on; like I said, 
sympathetic.  They put dirt on me, then helped me brush it off, saying oh, 
how terrible.

 An old man with one of those plastic necks drove up to drop off some 
aluminum cans.  He got back in his car and didn't start it for a long time.

 She watched ungulates washing up on the shore.  They had their sleeves pushed
 up to their elbows and were chattering about the latest Rae Tracy, virtual 
girl detective, video.

 She watched ungulates wash up on the beach.  She was sure now that the ocean 
was mostly ground glass; the waves were too hard and sparkly for it to be 
otherwise.  And the paint was already wearing off of
 the sand dunes.  Green fiberglas was showing through the most weathered spots.

 Hundreds of ungulates had washed up with the last tide, clogging drains and 
decorating the beach.  She decided to take casts of the decaying beasts.
  She put on hip boots and the gas mask. She loaded the foam gun.

[ Intermisson ]

I am the incarnation of evil.
 I will lick your face when you get out of your car and you will
 know fear.
 I will keep your parents in a bottle at the bottom of my purse
 where they will be forever pushed about by the sunglasses, kohl
 pencil and kleenex.
 I will steal your socks.
 When you are dead, i will give you a passing or failing grade. I
 will weigh your heart against a dried bat.  I will look you up
 in the phone book and enumerate your sins on network television.
 I will judge you on the Richter scale.
 I will chain myself to your coffin.

 But you haven't suffered enough!  I will lick your face and
 bring you back to life.  The terror of the situation will slowly
 become apparent to you.
 In the summer, i will kiss your ears.  In the winter, i will
 kiss your eyes.  In the spring, i will kiss your nose.  In the
 fall, i will kiss your mouth.  You will die again, and i will
 kiss the rest of you on your funeral pyre.  We will be consumed
 by a hideous orange pillar of flame that screams, deafening, to
 the sky.
 I will put your ashes into my purse, where your parents in their
 bottle will now have to dust constantly wherever the ashes
 settle.  You will become friends with whatever lint and crumbs
 you can find.

 But still you haven't suffered enough!  I will lick your face
 and you will return to life.  Your eyes will be wide with panic
 as you realize your position.
 I will make you so happy.
 I will tease you, and call you names, and lick your face, and
 you will be so terrified that your heart will stop but i will
 keep licking your face; i will not let you die.
 I promise you will always be my favorite zombie.
 I will hold you, forever, closest to my heart.
 I will let you enter a contest.  It is a contest to see who can
 drive, blindfolded, closest to the gap in the Bay Bridge without
 falling in.
 After your car is pulled from the bay, i will supervise the
 embalming of your body.  I will replace your internal organs
 with meatloaf and your blood with honey.
 But your new eyes of tourmaline set in quartz will make me
 reconsider; i will sit up for years staring at your corpse and
 wondering: "Have you suffered enough, my greatest love?  Could
 i cause you any more suffering?"

 And although you will be desiccated and crispy, i will lick your
 face once again.  And as you awake to this horror your rictus
 will soften slowly away and your body will be restored again to
 caressable flesh.
 You will think you are dreaming.
 I will let you dream only of me.
 And when we go out, people will stare at your quartz and
 tourmaline eyes.  They will be scarred by the invisible needles
 of the lasers stimulated by the electrical storm in your brain.
 And when we go out, you will open your veins to sweeten my tea
 with your blood.
 I will take you to visit your old friends, who will wonder at
 your appearance, and be amazed at the complicated hieroglyphic
 tattoos that appear on their bodies as your eyes wander over
 them.
 Everyone will ask how a man this dead could be this beautiful.
 But i will explain to them that you are not dead, you cannot be
 dead as long as i exist.  It is my love that makes you live.
 It is my love for your suffering and terror.

 Nobody takes me seriously.

 No one will rescue you.  There will be no one to take you from
 me.  Even if you were to escape me, no one could remove the
 lingering horror from your mind.
 With me, you will understand incomprehensible things.  You will
 believe incredible things.
 I will polish you to an impossible brightness.  Only the smoke
 of my breath will hide you from view.
 I will heat you to a white heat.  I will mark your incandescent
 skin with my fingernails.

 Even i cannot believe how happy i will make you.

 And yet, you will wish you were not His Endlessness at all, but
 unfeeling, inert and cold beneath the earth.  You will seek
 Death in ever more clever and subtle ways and, at length, find
 him in spite of my attentiveness.
 You will have learned how to hurt me, my ancient and powerful
 love.
 And i will leave you at last as all mortals truly desire to be--
 undisturbed by thought, feeling or experience.
 And i will go on through the aeons alone, troubled by your
 absence, always wondering, "Is it really possible that you have
 suffered enough?  Was my love somehow imperfect?  Can i never
 reawaken your fear, your desire?"
