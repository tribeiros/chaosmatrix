<H1>Chaos</H1>
<H2>by James Gleick</H2>

<HR>

Can a butterfly stirring the air in Beijing today transform
storms in New York next month?

    Watch two bits of foam flowing side by side at the bottom of
a waterfall. What can you guess about how close they were at the
top? Nothing. As far as theoretical physics is concerned, God
might just as well have taken all those water molecules under the
table and shuffled them personally. Traditionally, when
physicists saw complex results, they looked for complex causes<P>

    Now all that has changed. In the last 20 years, scientists
have created an alternative set of ideas: Simple systems give
rise to complex behavior. Complex systems give rise to simple
behavior. More important, the laws of complexity hold
universally, caring not at all for the details of a system's
constituent atoms. And "chaos"--the obstinate element of disorder
within order, of variation where predictability was expected--has
become a shorthand name for a fast-growing movement that is
reshaping the fabric of the scientific establishment in the
United States, Europe, and Japan.<P>

    Where chaos begins, classical science stops. For as long as
the world has had physicists inquiring into the laws of nature,
it has suffered a special ignorance about disorder: in the
atmosphere, in the turbulent sea, in the fluctuations of wildlife
populations, in the oscillations of the heart and brain. The
irregular side of nature, the discontinuous and erratic
side--these have been puzzles to science, or worse,
monstrosities.<P>

    But just over a decade ago, a few scientists in the United
States and Europe began to find a way through disorder. They were
mathematicians, physicists, biologists, chemists--all seeking
connections between different kinds of irregularity.
Physiologists found a surprising order in the chaos that develops
in the human heart. Ecologists explored the rise and fall of
gypsy moth populations. Economists dug out old stock price data
and tried a new kind of analysis. The insights that emerged led
them to parallels in the natural world--the shapes of clouds, the
paths of lightning, the microscopic intertwining of blood
vessels, the galactic clustering of stars.<P>

    Such puzzles and monstrosities are the domain of the
revolution in chaos--a revolution not of technology, like the
laser revolution or the computer revolution, but a revolution of
ideas. This revolution began with a set of ideas having to do
with disorder in nature: from turbulence in fluids, to the
erratic flows of epidemics, to the arrhythmic writhing of a human
heart in the moments before death. It has continued with an even
broader set of ideas that might be better classified under the
rubric of complexity.<P>

    It is a revolution in every sense that that word can be
applied to science. It has been sudden. It has radically
transformed the way scientists think about their universe, the
way they perceive the complexity that always exists in their
slices of nature. It has brought a good deal of turbulence in the
bureaucracy of science--from hurt feelings and rejected papers in
the early days, to new, expensive, interdisciplinary institutes
in these days of trendy success.<P>

    Those concerned about education argue that chaos should
be--and can be--part of the earliest education of scientists and
nonscientists. One prominent biologist, Robert May of Oxford
University, has called on educators to give every student a
pocket calculator and show them how to play with a simple chaotic
equation. He contends that it would change the way they think
about everything from the theory of business cycles to the
propagation of rumors.<P>

    Where does complexity come from: complex behavior or complex
organization? This has been an odd question, in a way. Scientists
were not used to thinking about complexity as a thing with a life
of its own. But the question of how complexity is born and how it
evolves is one that this new science of chaos is beginning to
crack. Those who care about the behavior of groups of people--the
behavior that drives the stock market, and the behavior that
shapes the organization of large corporations--are beginning to
pay attention to chaos.<P>

    As recently as two decades ago, most practicing scientists
shared a few unspoken beliefs. For example, simple systems behave
in simple ways. A mechanical contraption like a pendulum, a small
electrical circuit, an idealized population of fish in a pond--as
long as these systems could be reduced to a few perfectly
understood, perfectly deterministic laws, their long-term
behavior would be stable and predictable. Another belief: Complex
behavior seemed to imply complex causes. A mechanical device, an
electrical circuit, a wildlife population, a fluid flow, a
biological organ, a particle beam, an atmospheric storm, a
national economy--systems that were visibly unstable,
unpredictable, or out of control must, scientists believed,
either be governed by a multitude of independent components or
subject to random external influences.<P>

    The first chaos theorists, the scientists who set the
discipline in motion, shared certain sensibilities. They had an
eye for pattern, especially pattern that appeared on different
scales at the same time. They had a taste for randomness and
complexity, for jagged edges and sudden leaps. Believers in
chaos--and they sometimes call themselves believers, or converts,
or evangelists--speculate about determinism and free will, about
evolution, about the nature of conscious intelligence. They feel
that they are turning back a trend in science toward
reductionism, the analysis of systems in terms of their
constituent parts: quarks, chromosomes, or neurons. They believe
that they are looking for the whole.<P>

    The most passionate advocates of the new science go so far as
to say that 20th-century science will be remembered for just
three things: relativity, quantum mechanics, and chaos. Chaos,
they contend, has become the century's third great revolution in
the physical sciences. Like those revolutions before it, chaos
cuts away at the tenets of Newton's physics. As one physicist
puts it: "Relativity eliminated the Newtonian illusion of
absolute space and time; quantum theory eliminated the Newtonian
dream of a controllable measurement process; and chaos eliminates
the Laplacian fantasy of deterministic predictability."<P>

    Of the three, the revolution in chaos applies to the universe
we see and touch, to objects at human scale. Everyday experience
and real pictures of the world have become legitimate targets for
inquiry. There has long been a feeling, not always expressed
openly, that theoretical physics has strayed far from human
intuition about the world. Whether this will prove to be fruitful
heresy or just plain heresy, no one knows. But some of those who
thought physics might be working its way into a corner now look
to chaos as a way out.<P>

    The modern study of chaos began with the creeping realization
in the 1960's that quite simple mathematical equations could
model systems every bit as violent as a waterfall. Tiny
differences in input could quickly become overwhelming
differences in output--a phenomenon given the name "sensitive
dependence on initial conditions." In weather, for example, this
translates into what is known as the Butterfly Effect--the notion
that a butterfly stirring the air today in Beijing can transform
storm systems next month in New York.<P>

    In 1961, Edward Lorenz, a theoretical meteorologist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a simulated
weather model in his new electronic computer, based on 12
numerical rules--equations that expressed the relationships
between temperature and pressure, pressure and wind speed, and so
forth. Lorenz understood that he was putting into practice the
laws of Newton. Thanks to the determinism of physical law,
further intervention would then be unnecessary. Those who made
such models took for granted that, from present to future, the
laws of motion provide a bridge of mathematical certainty.
Understand the laws and you understand the universe. But there
was always one small compromise, so small that working scientists
usually forgot it was there, lurking in a corner of their
philosophies like an unpaid bill: Measurement could never be
perfect. Scientists marching under Newton's banner actually waved
another flag that said something like this: Given an approximate
knowledge of a system's initial conditions and an understanding
of natural law, one can calculate the approximate behavior of the
system. This assumption lay at the heart of science. As one
theoretician liked to tell his students: "There's a convergence
in the way things work, and arbitrarily small influences don't
blow up to have arbitrarily large effects."<P>

    At first, Lorenz's printouts seemed to behave in those
recognizable ways. They matched his cherished intuition about the
weather, his sense that it repeated itself, displaying familiar
patterns over time, pressure rising and falling, the air stream
swinging north and south. But the repetitions were never exact.
There were patterns, with disturbances. An orderly disorder.<P>

    One day in the winter of 1961, wanting to examine one
sequence at greater length, Lorenz took a shortcut. Instead of
starting the whole run over, he started midway through. To give
the machine its initial conditions, he typed the numbers straight
from the earlier printout. Then he walked down the hall to get
away from the noise and drink a cup of coffee.<P>

    The new run should have exactly duplicated the old. Yet as he
stared at the new printout, Lorenz saw his weather diverging so
rapidly from the pattern of the last run that, within just a few
simulated "months," all resemblance had disappeared. At first he
suspected a malfunction. But suddenly he realized the truth. In
the computer's memory, six decimal places were stored. On the
printout, to save space, just three appeared. Lorenz had entered
the shorter, rounded-off numbers, assuming that the
difference--one part in a thousand--was inconsequential.<P>

    A small numerical error was like a small puff of wind--surely
the small puffs faded or canceled each other out before they
could change important, large-scale features of the weather. Yet
in Lorenz's system of equations, small error proved catastrophic.
For reasons of mathematical intuition that his colleagues would
understand only later, Lorenz felt a jolt. The practical import
could be staggering. The Butterfly Effect meant that long-term
weather forecasting would be impossible.<P>

    But Lorenz saw beyond the randomness embedded in his weather
model. He saw a fine geometric structure, order masquerading as
randomness. He turned his attention more and more to the
mathematics of systems that never found a steady state, that
almost repeated themselves but never quite succeeded, trying to
find simple equations that would produce the aperiodicity he was
seeking. At first his computer tended to lock into repetitive
cycles. But he finally succeeded when he put in an equation that
varied the amount of heating from east to west, corresponding to
the real-world variation between the way the sun warms the
western coast of Europe and the way it warms the Atlantic Ocean.
The repetition disappeared.<P>

    He continued to seek simpler and simpler models and to
examine other dynamic fluid systems. His models turned out to
have exact analogues in real systems. For example, his equations
precisely described an old-fashioned electrical dynamo, where
current flows through a disc that rotates through a magnetic
field. Under certain conditions, the dynamo can reverse itself.
Such behavior, scientists later suggested, might provide an
explanation for another peculiar reversing phenomenon: the
earthly magnetic field, or "geodynamo," that is known to have
flopped many times during the earth's history, at intervals that
seem erratic and inexplicable. Another system precisely described
by Lorenz's equations is a simple-looking water wheel--simple,
yet capable of stunningly chaotic reversals of direction.<P>

    As Lorenz's ideas spread and others arrived at similar kinds
of conclusions, many scientists felt an intellectual excitement
that comes with the truly new. To the Nobel Prize-winning
physicist Freeman Dyson at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, the news of chaos came "like an electric shock" in the
1970's. Physicists began to face what many believed was a
deficiency in their education about even such simple systems as
the pendulum.<P>

    The pendulum was the classical model of measurable
regularity. Galileo believed that a pendulum of a given length
not only keeps precise time but keeps the same time no matter how
wide or narrow the angle of its swing. He made his claim in terms
of experimentation, but the theory made it convincing--so much so
that it is still taught as gospel in most high school physics
classes. But it is wrong. The regularity Galileo saw is only an
approximation. The changing angle of the bob's motion creates a
slight nonlinearity in the equations.<P>

    Consider a playground swing. It accelerates on its way down,
decelerates on its way up, all the while losing a bit of speed to
friction. It gets a regular push--say, from some clockwork
machine. All our intuition tells us that, no matter where the
swing might start, the motion will eventually settle down to a
regular back-and forth pattern, with the swing coming to the same
height each time. That can happen. Yet odd as it seems, the
motion can also turn erratic, first high, then low, never
settling down to a steady state and never exactly repeating a
pattern of swings that came before. The surprising behavior comes
from a nonlinear twist in the flow of energy in and out of this
simple oscillator. The swing is damped and it is driven: damped
because friction is trying to bring it to a halt; driven because
it is getting periodic pushes. Even when a damped, driven system
is at equilibrium, it is not at equilibrium--and the world is
full of such systems, beginning with the weather: damped by the
friction of moving air and water, and by the dissipation of heat
to outer space; and driven by the constant push of the sun's
energy.<P>

    As chaos began to unite the study of different systems,
pendulum dynamics broadened to cover high technologies from
lasers to superconductors. Some chemical reactions displayed
pendulum-like behavior, as did the beating heart. In all these
phenomena, nature forms patterns. Some are orderly in space but
disorderly in time, others orderly in time but disorderly in
space. Some patterns are fractal, highly irregular and
fragmented, exhibiting structures self-similar in scale. Self-
similarity is symmetry across scale. It implies recursion,
pattern inside of pattern, like an aerial picture of a coastline
or a snowflake shape. Others give rise to steady states or
oscillating ones. Pattern formation has now become a branch of
physics and of materials science, allowing scientists to model
the aggregation of particles into clusters, the fractured spread
of electrical discharges, and the growth of crystals in ice and
metal alloys.<P>

    The dynamics seem so basic--shapes changing in space and
time-yet only now are the tools available to understand them. It
is a fair question now to ask a physicist, "Why are all
snowflakes different?"<P>

    Ice crystals form in the turbulent air with a famous blending
of symmetry and chance, the special beauty of six-fold
indeterminacy, obeying mathematical laws of surprising subtlety,
making it formerly impossible to predict how fast a flake tip
would grow, how narrow it would be, or how often it would branch.
When a crystal solidifies outward from an initial seed--as a
snowflake does, grabbing water molecules as it falls--the process
becomes unstable.<P>

    The physics of heat diffusion cannot completely explain the
patterns. But recently scientists worked out a way to incorporate
another process--surface tension. The heart of the new snowflake
model is the essence of chaos: a delicate balance between forces
of stability and forces of instability, a powerful interplay of
forces on atomic scales and forces on everyday scales.<P>

    Because the laws of growth are purely deterministic,
snowflakes maintain a near-perfect symmetry. But the nature of
the turbulent air is such that any pair of snowflakes will travel
very different paths. The final flake records the history of all
the changing weather conditions it has experienced, and the
combinations may as well be infinite.<P>

    Classical physics could complete its mission without
answering some of the most fundamental questions about nature.
How does life begin? What is turbulence? And above all, in a
universe ruled by entropy, drawing inexorably toward greater and
greater disorder, how does order arise? Only a new kind of
science could begin to address those questions, to cross the vast
gulf between knowledge of what one thing does--one water
molecule, one neuron--and what millions of them do.<P>

    "God plays dice with the universe," says one chaos
specialist, the physicist Joseph Ford, in answer to Einstein's
famous question. "But they're loaded dice. And the main object of
physics now is to find out by what rules were they loaded and how
we can use them for our own ends.<P>
