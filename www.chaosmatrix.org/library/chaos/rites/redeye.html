<H1>Blinding the Red Eye</H1>
<H3>by Grizzuel <!--grizzuel@orisis.net--></H3>

<HR><BR>

This working is to conceal the subject specifically from the attention
and perception of those who would bring harm to them.  This is distinguished
from a general concealment working in that this selectively excludes only
those with hostile intent.<BR><BR>

Materials Needed:
<UL>
<LI>1 piece of regular white paper (for the eye)
<LI>1 piece of paper cut to about half the size (for the sigil)
<LI>Magic markers
<LI>Lighter
<LI>Glue
</UL>

<OL START=0>
<LI>Opening by preferred means

<LI>   Statement of intent:  I will to conceal <subject> from the eye of
       malice.
       -Sigilize the above statement by omitting repeat letters and
       combining the remainder.  Make a mantra out of the remainder as well.

<LI>   Draw a picture of an eye, bloodshot, with a red iris.
       -Apply a very thin (to dry quickly) coat of glue to the back of the
       sigil
       -apply sigil over the drawn eye, fully covering the iris at least.

<LI>   Meditate on the image of the fawn; scentless to predators, until
       gnosis is reached.  Let this imagery fade out and be replaced by the
       sigil.

<LI>   Crumple paper and burn sigil, repeating the mantra while doing so.

<LI>   Banishing by preferred means.
</OL>
