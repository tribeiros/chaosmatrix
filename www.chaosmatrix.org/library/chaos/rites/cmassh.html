<H1>Mass of Chaos "H"</H1>
<H3>by Phil Hine</H3>
<HR>

This short 'rite' can be used as an 'earthing' sequence to close
off a 'heavy' group session. It's aim is to promote laughter by
exposing the perils of self-importance.<P>

Discordians have long identified Harpo Marx as a contemporary
avatar of Harpocrates, the God of Silence. Harpo is Lord of Silence,
trickster and sacred clown.<P>

<H3>Preparation</H3>

Priest to take on manifestation of HARPO may be adorned with woolly
wig, top hat, and horn. Any other props for the use of the god
may be placed on the altar, such as a feather duster or tickling
stick.<P>

<H3>Statement of Intent</H3>

<I>It is our will to invoke HARPO, Sacred Fool and Lord of Silent
Mockery, that the glamours of magic be dispersed, and Laughing
Anarchy enter our hearts.</I><P>

Priest: "Let the pomposity begin.<P>

Celebrants then proceed to strut about the room, making self-important
proclamations about the 'serious' and 'holy' paths of magic, and
attest loudly that, as magi, they should be admired and respected
by all.<P>

As the celebrants do this, the Priest, in the center of the room,
begins to prance and whirl about, making appropriate gestures
and faces (visualizing himself as Harpo) until the avatar, drawn
to a space where so much pomposity and self-importance is evident,
chooses to manifest.<P>

As the Priest feels the avatar come upon him, he brandishes the
horn and gives the litany:<P>

<I>Honk, Honk, Honk, Honk, Honk (ad infinitum)</I><P>

Upon hearing the sound of the horn, all celebrants must 'freeze'
into statues of pomposity and self-importance. HARPO then has
free reign to play whatever tricks and capers he will, his aim
being to reduce the assembly to laughter. An effective way of
doing this is, when Harpo's ministrations has forced one person
to 'crack up' into laughter, they assist him in teasing and mocking
the celebrants, until the whole assembly is laughing.<P>

The rite may end here, or alternatively, Harpo may choose to deliver
a sacrament in some fashion. If a Banishing is required, the Priest
should be divested of his props, and coaxed from silence into
speech.<P>
