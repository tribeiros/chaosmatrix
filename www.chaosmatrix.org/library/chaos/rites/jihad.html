<H1>The Jihad of Chaos</H1>
<H2>An exercise of the Sword,<BR>
to complement the work of the Wand in Chaos Monasticism.</H2>

<HR>

    Candidates may elect to perform the Jihad (Holy War)
for any period of their own choosing and to adopt the title
"Aeonic Warrior" for the duration of their Jihad.  Jihad is
performed for several purposes:<P>

<OL>
<LI>To test, expand, and sharpen personal magical skills.
<LI>As an experiment in controlled fanaticism.
<LI>To Immanentize the Eschaton, the bringing-forth of the
   Pandaemonaeon.
<LI>To attack regressive or anti-aeonic targets.
</OL>

    Candidates may elect to perform Jihad in three modes;
the Lesser, Greater, or the Extreme.  At all times when on
Jihad an Aeonic Warrior bears a magical dagger.  This weapon
may be carried in a concealed fashion, and the warrior
should also sleep with it.  The dagger functions as a
constant reminder of the work in hand and may also find
application in magical combat.  The word "dagger" may be
loosely interpreted to include instruments which would
usually be classed as swords if desired, but the instrument
should at least be of a size to be useful in physical
combat.  Complete celibacy is to be maintained throughout
Jihad.  All sexual activities and thoughts should be
vigorously suppressed and the resulting tensions and
energies directed towards the martial gnosis of the
Warrior.  Candidates may choose to supplement the formal
duties of their Jihad with such pleasures and privations as
sleeping on a hard surface, eating a limited diet of high
protein foods and taking vigorous exercise daily.<P>

<HR>

<H3>Lesser Jihad Duties</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Carry a Magical Dagger at all times.
<LI>Complete celibacy.
<LI>Perform the Vortex Rite upon awakening and upon
   retiring.  One performance should be preceded by the
   recitation of a Chaoist Catechism and be performed for
   the Immanentization of the Eschaton.  The other should
   be used to Chaobolt a suitable target.
</OL>

<H3>Greater Jihad Duties</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Perform the Lesser Jihad Duties.
<LI>Perform a third Vortex Rite to Chaobolt a second target.
</OL>

<H3>Extreme Jihad Duties</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Perform the Greater Jihad Duties (to include the
   Lesser).
<LI>Break sleep midway through to perform a full Entropy or
   Combat Magic Ritual against a selected target.
</OL>

<HR>
<H3>Notes</H3>


    Jihad begins with an oath taken over the dagger which
specifies the mode of Jihad, its duration and target(s) to
be attacked.  The dagger may afterwards be engraved with
numbers denoting mode and duration as with the wand in
Monasticism or else destroyed in the case of failure.<P>

    Targets may be Chaobolted at the climax of the Vortex
Rite either by the usual Barbaric Incantation procedure or
by the visualization of an astral Chaobolt hurled into the
Vortex.<P>

    A Chaobolt consists of a long sharp triangular pyramid
with a sigil on the triangular base which is visualized as
diminishing in size as it recedes away from the thrower,
point first.<P>

<HR>

    There is no fixed form to the Chaoist Catechism.  The
following example may be used, modified, or ignored at
will.<P>
