<H1>The Ouranos Rite</H1>

<HR>
<H3>
                        Introduction
</H3>
    The seven classical planetary bodies can be used to
represent the spectrum of psychology, according to the
principle implicit in pagan thought that a cosmology must
embody a psychology.  Ouranos/Uranus, the eighth body,
orbits outside the sphere of the classical planets and the
god forms or thought form attributed to them.  Thus it
forms an ideal symbol for that which encompasses all the
gods within its orbit: the magical personality.  It
represents not the power of the magic itself, which is
attributed to Pluto; but rather the desire to be a
magician, and the personality required to live as one.
Astronomically, this equates with the curious orbit of
Ouranos which, with its polar axis tilted at an eccentric
angle, almost on the plane of the ecliptic, symbolizes the
antinomian character of the magician, ever delving into
that which is weird, occult and perverse, to unlock its
secrets.  Ouranos can also be thought of as the dark side
of the Sun.  Whereas the classical bodies orbit the sun,
the bright center of the human personality; Ouranos
represents something more dark, and perhaps devious,
creeping round in the darkness outside of the normal.<P>

    The magician emblem of Ouranos is the serpent; and the
god form may be invoked or visualized, bearing a serpent-
shaped wand crowned with an Uraeus-style serpent in
Egyptian style, and garbed in raiment bearing the serpent
motif.<P>

    Ouranos has a characteristic color, which is
idiosyncratic to the person invoking it, called Octarine;
meaning the eighth color of the spectrum, which is the
color of magic and may be any color that represents magic
to the individual.  For most magicians, Octarine is simply
the color in which visualizations occur, if they are not
deliberately made into any particular color.  The
background Ouranian color is dark green.  Invoke for
Knowledge and Manipulation of things magical--that is, for
works of pure rather than applied magic--and for the
discovery of magical knowledge and techniques and magical
self-development, rather than to create direct effects.
Ouranos may be invoked for the creation or discovery of
magical languages, symbols and theories, and also for works
of psychiatry.<P>
