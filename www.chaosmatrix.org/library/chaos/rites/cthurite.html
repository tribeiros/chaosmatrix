<H1>The Rite of the Communion of Cthulu</H1>
<H2>by Tenebrous</H2>

<HR>

There are four participants in this Rite of Communion with Cthluhu,  The
High Priest of the Great Old Ones.  These  are:  the host of Cthulhu, the
Priest or Priestess, and the two worshippers.<P>

The Temple of Cthulhu is to be sparsely lit,  and  incense of Neptune is
burned to infuse the air  with  an  undersea  atmosphere  (evoking sunken
R'lyeh).  No  images  or  icons  of  the God should be present within the
Temple,  for  manifestation  is  to  take place  only  through  the Host.
No amulets or decorated robes are to be worn.<P>

 The following magickal weapons are utilised:<P>

 The Dagger,  to  trace  the  Elder  Sign;  the  Chalice,  to recieve the
Communion from the Host of Cthulhu, and to convey it to the Celebrants of
the Rite  (prior to the commencement of the ritual, the chalice is filled
with  salt  water,  the  medium  of  transmission  of the Communion, also
symbolising Great Cthulhu's watery grave);  two  ritual  drums  are  also
employed, one by each worshipper.<P>

The symmetrical  Trapezoid  of  Invocation  is drawn out in white or blue
chalk,  its  shortest  edge to the West (R'lyeh). The Celebrant who is to
manifest the Host sits within the Trapezoid at this side,  facing inward.
The Priest or Priestess  sits  within  the Eastern side, facing the Host.
The Worshippers take their positions to the  North and South,  within the
points of the Trapezoid. Once silence has fallen the rite is begun.<P>

 Standing,  the  Priest  or  Priestess  of  Cthulhu  performs the primary
banishment by tracing the Elder Sign (upright pentagram) towards the four
cardinal  points,  beginning  to  the  West  and  proceeding  in an anti-
clockwise rotation (the tracing of the Elder Sign begins upwards from the
bottom left-hand point).  The  following  God-names of the Great Old Ones
are  pronounced  with  the  completion  of  each pentagram:  to the West,
CTHULHU;  to the South,  YOG-SOTHOTH;  to the East,  HASTUR;  and  to the
North, SHUB-NIGGURATH.<P>

 The Priest or Priestess now resumes the seated position before the Host,
and makes the Call to Cthulhu:<P>

<CENTER>

              "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtan"<BR>

              (In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu lies dreaming.)<P>

 The Host and the Worshippers answer this call:<P>

                           "Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn"<BR>

                          (Yes! Yes! Cthulhu dreams!)<P>

 The Priest or Priestess now begins to chant the  Call to  Cthulhu in its
shortened form, as a Mantra of Invocation:<P>

                            "Cthulhu R'lyeh fhtagn"<BR>

                          (Cthulhu dreams in R'lyeh)<P>
</CENTER>

 The two worshippers join with this Mantra, using their drums to counter-
point the chanting,  thus  forming  a  net  of rhthymic sound to draw the
Presence of the Deity into the Trapezoid.  The Host,  however, is silent,
for he or she is to remain open to possession  by  the invoked God-force.
In order to encourage this  possession,  the  Host should concentrate all
mental and physic  energy  into  a visualisation of the image of Cthulhu,
and attempt to  identify  this  image  with  their own body and mind. The
physical position to be adopted by  the  Host  should  therefore  be that
traditionally associated with Cthulhu - that  is,  crouching  or sitting,
legs apart,  with hands resting on knees.  The  other  celebrants  should
likewise project their own visualisations of  Cthulhu  onto the figure of
the Host.<P>

 Once the presence of the Deity is felt within the Trapezoid (this may be
noted by a marked drop in temperature),  the  Priest/Priestess will begin
to direct its  energies  towards the Host,  via magickal passes performed
with the left hand. This is to be undertaken in sympathy with the rythyms
of the Mantra - a powerful focal point is thus induced within the body of
the Host,  forming  both  a  strong  attraction  to the God-force invoked
within the Trapezoid, and a physical gateway for its manifestation.<P>

 At the moment of possession,  the  power  and  identity of the Great God
Cthulhu  will  be  drawn into the body of the Host.  At the last instance
before total possession,  the  Host  calls forth the name of the God, and
the  Temple  falls  silent.  His  power  is radiated forth by the Priest/
Priestess,  who holds out the Chalice to collect these negatively-charged
emanations (Dreams from R'lyeh).<P>

 When the Dreams of Cthulhu have passed from the Host (often leaving them
mentally  and  physically  exhausted),  the  Priest/Priestess  offers the
collected emanations for consumption  (via the medium of the salt water),
firstly to the Host,  then to the two Worshippers, and lastly partakes of
the Communion him/herself.<P>

 Following  the  giving  of  Communion,  the Priest/Priestess repeats the
Banishment,  retracting  the  Elder  Sign  at  the  cardinal points,  and
repeating  the  respective  God-names.  Facing the West once more, he/she
declares the  Rite  of  Communion  of  Cthulhu completed,  and the Temple
closed.  The  participants may now leave the Trapezoid,  infused with the
trans-Yuggothian energies of the Great God Cthulhu.<P>
