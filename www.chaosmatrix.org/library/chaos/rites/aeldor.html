       Being the ritual conjuration of the Egregore named Aeldor

----------------------------------------------------------------------
<B>Attribution:</B> Black/Red/Yellow (Entropy, combat, self)

<B>Application: Primary:</B> the conjuration of the egregore known as Aeldor
Dulabrin, so he may strike back on your behalf.

<B>The power sources:</B> The Entity Aeldor, and your own hate/grief/frustration.

<B>History:</B>
Aeldor is an egregore created by magickal contamination, he used to be a
part of yours truly as a very, VERY evil AD&D character...(scoff all you
want) By the magickal contamination, being practising magick while still in
the Aeldor mindset, the part of me which was once a role I played became
semi-sentient, and turned into what psychologists would probable term "an
alter" however, as time progressed (some three years of "being" Aeldor for
five hours a week) Aeldor became more developed and real, in the sence that,
when playing the game, others perceived a distinct change in my demeanor,
and even in my facial features, which became very angular when in
character...

this went on for a while, until the character started to have insane and
theoretically impossible, luck with the dice...it was is if it did not want
to die,in a very bad way...I never failed any attacks or saving throws,
usually doing maximum damage on each attack.

This started to worry my dungeon Master who at one point addressed me in the
following way: "are you sure it's still YOU that's playing the game?"
Then it dawned on me...
Aeldor was alive...the rest of the OP-cult soon followed suit and told me it
was becoming obvious that Aeldor was no longer a part of my imagination
anymore...

then one day, Aeldor dissappeared.

I kept wondering why I could not properly roleplay the character
anymore...the answer was obvious, Aeldor had separated himself from my
etheric patter and become a spirit of sorts.

It was not soon after this that I atempted to contact him, it worked...
While being posessed by him, he told me that he was now free, no longer a
part of me...

Later I attempted several workings with Aeldor, and discovered that his
considerable "in-game" might, had not been lost during the transition from
fantasy to spirit...the person I attacked was never the same, and suffers
from Annorexia to this day.

<B>A brief description of Aeldor:</B>
Aeldor is a powerfull fiend, who used to be an elven archer, until he made a
pact with a demon to grant him great prowess and magickal abilities. It was
not soon after that his once noble spirit was corrupted and he was raised
into demonhood.

Aeldor still appears as a noble creature, with slanted eyes, pointed ears
and beautiful features, it is only in his eyes that his nature becomes
apparent, for they are completely black.
Aeldor usually carries his great bow, which has no string, for he is a
magnificent archer whocreates arrows ands strings from Will alone, his
accuracy is unfailing and his sight stretches for miles, he can easily shoot
a person from a mile away. his magickal prowess is also horrible, for he is
mad. and his spells bring madness.

<B>The Gnosis:</B>
To properly manifest Aeldor, it is highly desireable to be in a frenzied
state of hatred, bordering on outright insanity, to others you will appear
to be constantly shifting positions, unable to find any comfort whatsoever,
you will probably display an impossibly evil grin. If possession is proper,
you will speak in a hushed, sibillant tongue being unable to say anything
kind, without putting it in a tone which scintillates with malice.

<B>The Rite:</B>
Place an arrow of your own making in a prominent position and ignite various
dense incenses, you may also smoke many cigarretes and burn sulfer to get
the properly foul odour.
Make sure the place of your working is both tidy and "baroque" in
appearance, for aeldor is not used to modern technology and style.

vividly imagine the face of your foe and visualize the lines of a chaostar
appearing on it, crossing the face out.

Take some blood from a small "X" cut on the left side of your breast, over
the heart, and smear it on the arrow's tip.

close eyes.

Vibrate the name "Aeldor"  ten times.

Shout: "From dark woods, great evil comes!" three times, each more guttoral
than the previous.

Start to mumble to yourself about hate and anger and pain and laugh in  a
sickening voice at the horrors one can commit

Attempt to sink deeper into a state of complete and utter sadism and hatred
for the weak.

Interaction with the egregore.
(for use in attacks visualize the tall muscular being drawing it's bow, a
silvery strand of energy will be the string and a flaming green arrow the
projectile)

As the arrow is fired, snap the arrow you made...the snapping sound will
most likely bring you out of the trance, this is good, you do not want
Aeldor lingering in your subconcious.

Banish with Laughter.

end.
