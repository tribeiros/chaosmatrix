<H3>This page was a catalog listing of items the Caduceus Books had for sale in February 2000.
These items are no longer for sale!  This page, however, does have some excellent descriptions
of the items for sale, as well as pictures of several original Spare drawings.  Rather
than post the graphics individually, I felt it appropriate to place them on Chaos Matrix
with the entire listing where they came from.  While Caduceus books probably no longer has
these individual items, they do deal in Spare material quite often and may have some currently
for sale.<BR><BR>

Initialed (and numbered 53) on front. Signed, titled, dated 1954 and numbered 199 by Spare on reverse. Shown at the 1955 Archer Gallery exhibition, the catalogue of which gives its subtitle. It is a striking portrait, the face looking directly at the viewer. The top of the head shades into a background of shimmering, vibrant colour amongst which stalk two satyrs (one hermaphrodite) with finely drawn features, a naked woman cavorts and a winged female soars over. It was used as the cover illustration to Ramsey Dukes, What I Did During My Holidays, Essays on Black Magic, Satanism, Devil Worship &amp; Other Niceties, Mandrake with T.M.T.S. 1998. This work has the essay Exploring Spare’s Magic published in the Divine Draughtsman, Beskin Press 1987. <B>Order </B></FONT><A HREF="caduceus/P1.jpg"><B><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#800080">No. P1 (click here for image)</B></FONT></A><B><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#800080"> </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#0000ff">£2500</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following drawings were executed by Spare in 1924, part of a series which he titled the Book of Ugly Esctacy. It should be noted that the misspelling appears quite deliberate. While he signs his name and gives the rest of the title in a flowing hand, the word "Escacy" is written carefully, one letter at a time. Perhaps this arrangement of letters held some special significance, he uses it on occasion in Focus of life and Anathema of Zos. This series of drawings was the first, but not the only, time he used the concept Ugly Ecstasy, which appears central to his sexual Gnosis. Comparison has been made to Aleister Crowley’s endeavours to seek sexual encounters with amputees, dwarfs and people with deformities, that sexual desire be liberated from superficial attachments. Indeed striking similarities can be seen between the sexual magic of Crowley and Spare. Crowley wrote of magickal children, astral beings borne of energised sexual arousal, with sacramentalised sexual fluids the foundation for their existence. Here Spare drew them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these drawings are from the John Balance &amp; Coil collection. Coil being at the cutting edge of avante guarde occult music. All the drawings are in pencil upon A3 paper (29.7cm x 42cm). It should be noted that jpeg images come nowhere near doing the original images justice, the can only give some notion of the subject matter of the picture. Furthermore, to pick up the line the contrast has to be increased to such degree that spurious marks, not on the original can appear in the jpeg. Spare’s fine draughtmanship is notoriously difficult to reproduce. Indeed even the excellent and rightly applauded production by Fulgur Press, the Book of Ugly Ecstasy does not capture the complexity &amp; subtlety of the drawings. Lines that in the original are shades of grey are reproduced as black, which makes a considerable difference. Items D1 – D11 inclusive were reprinted in Fulgur’s Book of Ugly Ecstasy. They are clearly carefully finished, each is initialed and numbered by Spare. Items D12 – D31 inclusive, are more free form, indeed are probably automatic, but are from the same series. These have never been exhibited or published. There is some slight browning to the edges of the paper that does not detract from the drawings in any way, aside from that any fault is noted.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that the interpretations made concerning the artwork are speculative. They may, or may not, be true. Indeed given that some images are, to some degree, "automatic" and not consciously contrived by the artist it might be argued that any symbolism is unconscious. Thus their interpretation might have been a matter for speculation by Spare himself! Anyway, the reader may not agree, but may find it useful to have a proposition to disagree with. It would be tedious to surround every sentence with "perhaps" &amp; "may be" so we commence with this qualification.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Horned Satyr, with one male and one female breast fondles his distended testies. Snot drips from his nose. He sits upon a mound which has a horny head and a nose pouring forth effluvia. Astride his shoulder is a hirsute, cloven hoofed woman her arm reaching up behind her head in a typical Spare gesture, found for instance in Stealing the Fire from Heaven in the Book of Pleasure perhaps signifying reaching into another reality (ie behind the face) whilst rising through the planes. The runny nose may be taken as a glyph for ejaculation, these astral beings born of semen, reaching up to the Goddess.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again the woman has one arm reaching up and behind her head, the other points downwards to become a wing, a common gesture in Spares work (see Nature is more Atrocious in Focus of Life etc.) suggesting "As above so below" her legs trail into a fishes tail. Thus she is reminiscent of Levi’s Baphomet. One thinks of Spare’s statement in Anathema of Zos, written in the same years as these drawings were executed "All things become of desire, the legs to the fish, the wings to the reptile. Thus was your soul begotten" A glyph of transformation and potential, perhaps born of the desire of the male figure in front of her, tailed and clawed, his cock a birds head Initialed and numbered by Spare. <B>Order </FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#800080">No. </B></FONT><A HREF="caduceus/D02.jpg"><B><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#800080">D2 (click here for image)</B></FONT></A><B><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#0000ff"> </B>£1550</P>

Energies appear to be pouring forth to the ground from his thighs. Before him there seems to be manifesting a male figure dancing, one arm reaching up and behind his head.

He was a member of the Grub Group, an artists collective which, though Spare was not a member, arranged the exhibition and sale of some of his work. It would appear that Craig passed the book to another member of the group who had a closer affinity for Spare, Grace Rogers. The book has her bookplate, designed by Spare, depicting a female body with rams head, one arm morphing into a flaming wing. One thinks of the sexual arousal leading to glimpsed atavism and thence the potential for transformation and inspiration. Grace Rogers was a frequent contributor to the Golden Hind, her work influenced by Spare. She described Spare’s technique of automatic drawing and wrote the article "Symbology in Aesthetics in relation to the Art of Austin Osman Spare" in Artwork Vol. II No.5 1925. Frank Letchford noted "Grace was to help with his book Anathema of Zos which he created by juxtaposing and juggling with lines of his philosophic credo written down as aphorisms, until they made a mystic sense" thus confirming that Rodgers was close to Spare even when he was rejecting the artistic establishment.
