From his essay "Mind to Mind and How" (March 1951):<P>

"The means used and the way it happens are simple, the inverse of
scientific.  I use a traditional formula, created by instinctive guess and
*arbitrarily* formed, not evolved by hypothesis and experiment.  The law of
sorcery is its own law, using sympathetic symbols."<P>

...<P>

"Science, like Logic and Psychology, is its own bogey and as neurotic as its
own creed; its fear of deviation from its arbitrary standards and categories
confirms all the definitions of the psychopathic... Science also has to
await its rare artist -- to make an audacious guess for enlightenment or
mutation.  For me, the inexplicable of beauty, the undivulged of things
gives them their enchantment, not their known meaning."<P>

...<P>

"I have never yet witnessed any occult phenomena where money was involved
whether for expenses or anything else (I preclude the odd symbolic silver
coin)."<P>

...<P>

"Finally, scientists will never solve or prove anything related to
foretelling the future; it is a work for 'artists'.  Science may
subsequently prove more fully what the artists have already discovered."<P>
