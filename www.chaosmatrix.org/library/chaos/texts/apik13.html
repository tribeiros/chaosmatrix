"There is no tyranny in the state of confusion"...
The Media acts to censor information. All media nets are programmed
to give the illusion of free speech and multiple options. Political
manipulation of the media is becoming increasingly overt...
who cares?<P>

What about the so-called 'underground' of occult 'zines? They
tend to be the product of individuals, orders or groups, and provide
an essential network for passing information along - or of injecting
a healthy dose of Disinformation. We tend to judge an occult group
on the basis of the information circulating about them. Such judgements
are at best tenuous. Over the last few years, we've seen the "Chaoists
vs Traditionalists" debate, the 'Bitchcraft' of Wicca, and
the numerous OTO factions all jostling for position. Although
there is much discussion of the 'Chaos Current', the most powerful
current is that of electric cash registers ringing up another
sale... ching! Chaos Magick is already dead, and the only
living debate is between the vultures over who gets to gnaw the
biggest bones. So climb back into your chao-chambers, spheres,
polytraphezoids and disappear up your own void-flows. A prime
example, wouldn't you say, of the Spectacle "recovering"
a situation.<P>

Doubtless there be attempts to place L.O.O.N. into the faction
jigsaw. Fair enough, but "we like everybody". We like
the OTO, ONA, IOT, OS, OTOA, BOTA, SOL, OCS. We also like the
people who go on (at great length) about why they don't like the......
(insert your own choice). We may even be qabalists
poking fun at the whole Chaos Magick pose.<P>

Chaos Magick has been this Aeon's "thing". Relatively
big bucks on the strength of the frothing of the occult media.
Some say it did for magick what punk did for the music scene.
What follows then... New-Romagick?<BR>
