I don't know much about chaos magic in any academic, I-read-it-in-XXX
sense. Here's my recent experience with real chaos magic.<BR><BR>

A good friend of mine was in pain, and in an effort to lessen her pain, I
"healed" her. Along the lines of an old post Lauranz made entitled Occam's
Pot Scrubber, or something similar, I should more rightly say that she
reported feeling less pain after I perceived an action on my own part.<BR><BR>

We got into a discussion of how I do it. My answer didn't satisfy me,
completely, because I'm overly analytical. I told her that I healed because
I know it works. That's all.<BR><BR>

No paradigm. No invocation. No visualization. I lay on my hands, and I
concentrate on the knowledge that it Works, and it Works.<BR><BR>

They call it Faith Healing.<BR><BR>

I can analyze it. I really can. But my friend made an astoundingly concise
and insightful statement that removes my desire to do so: she said, "Steve,
it works because it's yours. You didn't read it in a book. It won't fail
because you're not doing it Hine's way, or Caroll's way, it will work,
because you're doing it your way."<BR><BR>

Similarly, her house is "haunted." By this I mean that upon entering a
particular room for the first time, I commented that it felt like someone
had hung themselves there. They have, or will. Her name is/will be Colleen.
The same night, this entity moved into the room we were sitting in, and
caused me great discomfort, in addition to lowering the ambient
temperature. Rather than invoke some great deity to cast it out, or banish
this "ghost," I simply calmed my self inwardly, felt my inner temperature,
and concentrated on feeling my temperature rise. I then <I>asked</I> the spirit
to bide its time, that the pain it would cause us would in no way lessen
its own, and that, in time, I would help it if I could.<BR><BR>

Nothing I've read or put supreme effort into has worked. When I want
results, I simply focus on what I know is true: that I have a modicum of
power within my Self, and that I can use it externally. It is my chi, my
Soul, my life force, and my aura.<BR><BR>

Chaos magic? This is chaos magic. Chaos magic is doing what <I>works</I>, for
<I>you</I>.<BR><BR>

Enjoy the story, folks, and I'll be seeing you in your dreams,<BR>
