<H1>On Dreamscaping</H1>
<H2>An experimental guide to the programing and control of Dreams</H2>

<H3>by Bill Costlow</H3>

<P><HR><P>

Everyone's perspective is different...Serge King in his book, "Urban
Shaman", says: you may not smell the perfume of a co-worker, but they know
it's there, you may not hear the music another person is listening to
unless you wear their headphones. Shared reality is limited -- we can all
sit in the same room and percieve different things. King talks about life
as a dream, and waking within the dream in order to change it ... most of
us think of dreaming as unreal. Many shamanic cultures believe
otherwise.<P>

King argues that the the keyboard in front of me isn't solid at all, but a
field of molecules vibrating at a frequency very close to the frequency
that my own molecules vibrate at. Radio waves, on the other hand, pass
right through us and the computer in front of us as well. The conscious
mind interperates the keyboard as "solid". We interprete dreams in much
the same way. <P>

Regardless of agreement with the above, dreaming, is a great way to speak
with your deep mind. What better way to get a leg up on quiting smoking or
dieting or whatever you choose. Life is what you think it is. <P>

Change your thinking: change your life. <P>

I've developed eight goals that every potential dreamscaper should have.
In support of those goals, I've developed a system of 3 sigils/mantras to
go with the diagram below: <P>

<XMP>
                        Matrix of 8 Universal Dream Goals
                        cooresponding to the Chaosphere


                                To Maintain Control



                Remember                                Realization of
                                                        Dream state
                                        |
                                     \  |  /
        Combat                    ------+------         Work a
        Adversaries                  /  |  \            Positive outcome
                                        |


                Find a                                  Find a
                Guide                                   Solution


                                   To command
                                   the Dream
</XMP>
<P>

Since any one goal leads to its opposite, there are only four steps. Steps
three and four are much more difficult. Step four may require a servator
to remind mage that s/he is in dreamstate. I've found that sigils planted
through vacuity give better results. <P>

Make a mantra/sigil from each of goal: this is a deeply personal, roll
your own: <P>

<UL>
<LI>Step 1: Remember. Without memory, there is no solution.<BR>
    <I>I will remember my dreams</I><P>

<LI>Step 2: Confront adversaries. Seek a positive outcome.<BR>
    <I>I will confront adversaries and ensure a positive outcome</I><P>

<LI>Step 3: Realization of dreamstate. Without awareness, finding a guide
    is difficult.<BR>
    <I>I will know when I am dreaming (a servitor helps here)</I><P>

<LI>Step 4: Maintain control & awareness of the dreamstate.<BR>
    <I>I will have control of my dreams</I><P>

</UL>
<P>

Step four can be misleading. You must think of dreamstate as an
interactive process with the deep mind. Many dream situations occur for a
reason and you may not want to tamper with that overmuch. For example,
when you dream of climbing a mountain, don't fly off to covort in
playland, continue to the top and see why you were climbing in the first
place.<P>

This plan requires some preparation. <P>

A dream diary and a daily reminder is absolutely necessary for success. A
small table light will also be helpful because dream memories fade swiftly
and a significant other is easily disturbed by a ceiling light. <P>

<OL>
<LI>Decide that "dreams are an important part of your life."

<LI>Design a ritual to enhance dreaming. Something as simple as lighting a
candle or stick of inscense with the simple invocation of "This is for the
dreams I will have tonight." will do.

<LI>A regular sleep schedule is extremely important. Be sure to get enough
rest and drink only in moderation. Alarm clocks that go off at
unreasonable hours are a real deterent. The best dreams seem to come
towards sun-up.

<LI>When you wake at night, your first action should be to record any
dreams you remember, even bullet comments about quickly fading dreams can
be helpful.

<LI>A list of dream goals should be reviewed several times a week. Doing
this each night seems to inhibite the process.

<LI>The intent to dream well needs to be a part of your daily endevors,
but trying too hard is detrimental. The list can be as long or short as
you like it to be. Your "Deep mind" will take only those suggestions it's
ready for.

<LI>Attaining "Seething" trance before sleep usually ensures vivid,
memorable dreams.
