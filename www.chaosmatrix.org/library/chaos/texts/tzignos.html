Alright, now I'm downright confused again... I need to know people's
opinions on gnosis.. what it is, how it is achieved... I think I am
confusing it with what buddhism calls "mindfulness"... are these two the
same thing, or are the different... for a long time I have done what they
call "living in the moment"... just sitting there with no thoughts, watching
the life thrive... is this gnosis?

In Chaos Magick, gnosis is a lapse in conscious/rational/discursive/
discriminatory mind that allows the subconscious "magickal mind" to fully
function.  The easiest example of this state that comes to mind is the
exact moment of orgasm.  The term "gnosis" is used (I think) because the
state allows for the instantaneous, intuitive (as opposed to consciously
deduced) grasping of a much larger set of the variables involved in
causing an outcome to manifest from any given state of events.  This is
done because the time it takes to reason out such a large set prohibits
effect; by the time the relationships are consciously worked out, the
variables have changed.  It must be done instantaneously in order to be
effective.  Were there to be a qabalistic tree containing correspondences
for Chaos Magick, gnosis would likely be placed at Kether, and the
psychic censor (the most basic, binary discriminatory function) at
Chokmah.<P>

After the state of gnosis has ended, one can get an idea of how "profound"
the state was by trying to recall exactly what happened while you were in
in it.  The less that can be remembered, the more profound the state.
Perfect gnosis would leave no signature in the rational mind, not even
the awareness of a gap in time.<P>
