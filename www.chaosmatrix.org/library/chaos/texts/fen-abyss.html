<H1>Cross the Abyss?</H1>
<H3>by Fenwick Rysen</H3>

<HR><BR>

What is it with all this "What is the abyss?" stuff, eh?<BR><BR>

I don't beLIEve in the Abyss, and I suspect that the feeling is mutual and
that the Abyss chooses not to beLIEve in me.<BR><BR>

If I cross the street, is that any less important or significant than
crossing the abyss, whatever it is?  I was on this side, and now I'm on
that side, and such is my will.  Q:"Why did Fenwick cross the road?"
A:"Five tons of flax."<BR><BR>

I crossed the Abyss once, and then realized it wasn't the Abyss I'd
crossed---it was a black ribbon stretched to infinity in either direction,
and separated the world in two, and bridging it was a golden path filled
with laughing children.  On the opposite side glowed white lights that
beckoned me to join them:  *WALK* they flashed...  *WALK* *WALK* *WALK* and
so I walked.  *DON'T WALK* *DON'T WALK* *DON'T WALK* and so I stopped.<BR><BR>

The whole mess about the abyss is too transcendent for me; I don't beLIEve
in transcendentalism.  I'm much more pragmatic about my magick; ever the
kitchen witch.  Can I feel my magick, see my magick, taste my magick?  Yes?
Then that's the way I like it.  If I'm looking for enlightenment or
transcendental experiences, I don't look to magick---I look to friends and
family.  My lover, my friends, my family all teach me more about life,
magick, and enlightenment than sitting alone in a dark room attempting to
cross or master some ephemeral "Abyss" ever has.<BR><BR>

There is no such thing as the Abyss, and crossing it was wondrous.<BR><BR>

"If you gaze into the abyss, then the abyss also gazes into you"<BR>
--Freidrich Nietzche<BR><BR>

Sorry...  Just a long and probably meaningless (possibly extremely lucid)
rant brought on by a very good glass (or three) of Merlot and a cat purring
contentedly in my lap.  Abyss Schmabyss; fuck it all.  Talk about it all
you want, you'll just be blowing wind.  Words words words...<BR><BR

Once upon a time, I got really frustrated with one of my teachers when I
asked him about the abyss.  He wouldn't tell me anything about it, other
than "It defies words".  He never told me how to cross it---those who are
ready to cross it do so.  I understood his reasons some years later.  And
now here I am doing the same damned thing.  Fuck it all.<BR><BR>
