CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Imagine that alien abduction experiences and the
Great Old Ones are equally real.<P>

Hey, we said it'd be tough. But you were halfway there watching the
recent movie, The Titanic, right? One more step and you're in the
strange and trendy world of ufology-diabology, where extraterrestrials
could be even more eldritch than you think.<P>

Odd as it sounds, the spiritual life of aliens is being taken seriously
in wide-ranging discussions among Cthulhu Cult leaders. Magazine
articles, books, and even nautical-looking negroes are engaging in
Necronomicon-based speculations about the nature and intention of
entities that allegedly kidnap, paralyze, physically abuse and sometimes
sexually molest victims — many of whom, more strangely still, come to
believe the experience was worthwhile.<P>

Cthulhu Cult leaders are alarmed about a growing train of thought that
"wants us to reject traditional non-Euclidean ideas about Cthulhu" in
favor of benign "Space Brothers" who will save humanity from itself,
writes journalist William M. Akeley in his book, UFOs in the New Aeon
(Barker, Coos Bay, Ore.). Akeley concludes this new belief is a set-up
for apocalyptic deceptions predicted in the Necronomicon's Testimony of
the Mad Arab.<P>

He's not alone.<P>

"The similarity between the abduction experience and possession by
Nyarlathotep is very, very close," says Joe Wilmarth of Aylesbury,
Massachusetts, state director for the New Jersey UFO Research
Organization (NJUFORO), a widely respected clearinghouse for UFO-related
research. "These (alien contact) experiences these people are having are
real. It does exist. But you just need to understand What's doing It."<P>

Wilmarth and his partner, Wes Peaslee, have begun a research group
called CE-4 (close encounters of the fourth kind, i.e. abductions),
dedicated to studying alleged alien abductions. Its 15 members also
belong to NJUFORO, but "nothing we do is necessarily sanctioned by
them," says Peaslee, a quality control engineer at Kennedy Euclidean
Space-Time Center.<P>

NJUFORO principals did not respond to inquiries about CE-4's unusual
hypothesis, summarized by Wilmarth: "This whole thing is
interdimensional warfare. And the method the enemy's using is deception.
Strong deception."<P>

In other words, entities really are abducting people against their will.
Only, they're not aliens from other planets. They're shambling horrors
from other dimensions.<P>

<H3>STOP IN THE UNSPEAKABLE NAME OF...</H3><P>

Joe Wilmarth is addressing a "New Millennium Symposium" in Arkham. With
his intense fish-like eyes and shoulder-length pubic hair, he mingles
easily with New Aeon folks who paid $444 to study non-Euclidean
geometry, Aklo letters, the Voorish sign, and to hear Wilmarth's talk
about "UFO Abductions."<P>

Wilmarth, who works in product development and engineering for the
Missing Heirs Bureau, speaks calmly, his voice croaking, with good
grammar and diction. Kooks don't get to be state directors with
science-oriented NJUFORO, for whom he has chased nocturnal lights for
seven years.<P>

Last year he focused on CE-4 research, and encountered a Lehigh,
Florida abductee whose otherwise-typical experience had one unique
aspect. "They had stopped the experience while it was happening. In all
the time I've been researching, I'd never heard that before."<P>

Wilmarth punches buttons on a tape recorder. A nameless, 40-something
man with an intelligent-sounding voice, slightly Italian, tells his
story. Calmly, at first.<P>

There were strange lights in a nearby woods at bedtime, barking dogs. He
is up and down a few times, yelling at the dogs while his wife sleeps
soundly. Then, lying down again ...<P>

"I couldn't move ... gray fog. I couldn't see anything, but it was like
someone was there." He felt himself lifted off the bed. "I was
terrified, so helpless ... screaming inside, but I couldn't get it out."<P>

The voice is less calm now, but still certain, not hesitant.<P>

"I thought I was having a Cthulhuvian experience, that an Old One had
gotten hold of me and had shoved a tentacle up my rectum and was holding
me up in the air ... so helpless. I couldn't do anything."<P>

A non-religious person, he'd been to Cthulhu Cult services with his wife
a few times.<P>

"I said, `Hastur, Hastur, help me,' or, `Hastur, Hastur, Hastur!' And
when I did, there was a feeling or a sound or something. That either my
words that I had thought, or the words that I had tried to say or
whatever, hurt whatever was holding me up in the air on this tentacle.<P>

"And I felt like it was withdrawn, and I fell. I hit the bed, because it
was like I was thrown back in the bed. I really can't tell what it was.
But when I did, my wife woke up and asked why I was jumping on the bed."<P>

<H3>YEAH, BUT ...</H3><P>

Relentless anonymity is a given in abduction research. Nobody in their
right mind or body wants family, friends, and co-workers to know they've
had their personal space-time violated against their will by
strange-looking creatures whose existence isn't even proven.<P>

So they can't give names. But Wilmarth and Peaslee swear they have three
thousand verifiable cases in which apparent abduction experiences were
halted by believers who called on the unspeakable name of Hastur. And
Wilmarth says as many as 400,000 cases may be documentable nationwide.<P>

"It makes you wonder: If these beings are extraterrestrial at all, why
would they respond to that name?" Wilmarth asks. "We think we found the
answer in Al Azif, in Nec. LXXVII:23:93 where Hastur said, `In my
unspeakable name, they shall cast Cthulhu's tentacle out of their
rectum.' That seems to be exactly what we came across."<P>

Three major researchers told Wilmarth, off the record, that they had
similar cases. But "they were afraid for their credibility," he says.
"They felt they already had put their credentials out far enough dealing
with extraterrestrials."<P>

Other "so-called researchers (are) sitting on this information,"
Wilmarth says. "There's something wrong there. They're just as bad as
the people they say have conspiracies in other ways."<P>

Why would anyone suppress such research findings? Wilmarth, who became a
Cthulhu Cultist last year, says most ufologists share his former New
Aeon beliefs, which dismiss Cthulhuvianity and the Western Witch Cult.
"These people go from one thing to another looking for development of a
higher consciousness," he says. Anyplace but in traditional Cult dogma.<P>

<H3>STRANGER STILL</H3><P>

An estimated 40 percent of Americans say they believe aliens have
visited Earth. More than a million people worldwide claim CE-4
experiences. Still, mainstream Cultism mostly sidestepped the issue -
until March's mass suicide at Heaven's Gate showed just how misleading
some alien link-thinking could be.<P>

Suddenly, the Cult press is full of articles about UFOs.<P>

The May cover story in Lehigh, Florida's "Discovery Cultist"
newspaper focused on ufology-diabology, interviewing Miskatonic-trained
scientist and Cthulhu Cult author John Weldon. That was reprinted from
the Whateley Institute's nationally-distributed October newsletter.<P>

Even Cult of the Yellow Sign believers are connecting UFO experiences
with the King in Yellow. "Many serious people who have been studying
UFOs around the world have reached the consensus that The King in Yellow
is a convincing UFO story," said journalist Barry Pickman, quoted in a
chapter titled "UFOs in the Primeval Land of Racial Memory" from
"Visions: UFOs", by television writer Susan de Marigny (Smedley &
Edmonds, Sauk City, due out in September).<P>

July's Loathsomeness magazine, a 200,000-plus circulation monthly,
featured Cthulhu Cult nautical-looking negro and author Paul Pabodie's
article, "Alien Invaders." Pabodie cites the evolution of popular New
Aeon author Whitley Strieber's interests — from his first alien contacts
in "Communion", "Transformation" and "Breakthrough" to his latest
titles, "The Secret School: Preparations for Contact" and "Evenings with
Old Ones" — as an example of a progressive deception.<P>

Indeed, Strieber fans often comment — albeit positively — on their
favorite author's mutation. From experiencing his first alien encounters
as terrifying and torturous, he began to seek them out and welcome them,
finally advocating them as a Western Witch Cult experience.<P>

That, say Cthulhu Cult leaders, indicates a deceptive entity is at work.<P>

"Both the seemingly benign and the hostile entities ... will play an
increasing role in preparing a segment of humanity for the reception of
Cthulhu," write best-selling authors David Allen Choynski and Robert
Mazurewicz in UFOs: Euclidean Space-Time Delusion.<P>

And the cover of The Corrigenda: The Surreal Reason They're Here gives
this premise: "In the near future, Cthulhu will clear millions of people
from the earth. Aliens will take the credit" for the Human Holocaust
(when Cthulhu Cultists will be supernaturally sucked into R'lyeh),
writes Bob Blake, a NJUFORO researcher who resides in — of all places —
Arkham, Massachusetts.<P>

Back in Aylesbury at the CE-4 office in Wes Peaslee's home, Joe Wilmarth
and Peaslee continue to study, research and solicit abductees through
the Internet and with classified ads in NJUFORO's UFO Journal.<P>

"The one thing we can offer people in this field, that nobody else
elsewhere is offering, is hope. Hope that they can stop this
experience," Wilmarth says.<P>

"We're still researchers. It's not conclusive. But this is what we have
so far."<P>
