<I>"The SELF is infinite and you are just one facet of it,
unaware of your other bodies and lives. Dreams are the key. Dreams,
waking or sleeping, are links between you and your <U>parallel</U>
incarnations. You must be receptive to them. Tell your SELF before
you sleep, that you will dream of your Unearthly Facet."</I><BR>

Reincarnation is something of a bugaboo for many modern occultists.
This is probably due to the number of "I was Crowley/Cleopatra"
types that one runs into from time to time. Funny that I never
meet any ex-lepers. Less common is the idea alluded to above,
that each individual exists as a facet of a Self which has a multitude
of incarnations, each with their own reality. Facets which are
both human and non-human. The Human facets could arise from alternative
courses of action that you (the self reading this paper) could
have taken, but chose another. Sounds pretty wacky, no? This model
is at least a mathematical possibility, as described by three
physicists: Everett, Wheeler and Graham. Saul-Paul Sirag explains:<P>

<I>"In the Universe next door, I'm still a Physicist but
working at a different field of research. A few universes over
I'm an actor who dropped out of physics and never came back to
it. In another universe I died in a concentration camp and don't
exist in the present time at all."

It goes without saying that most physicists don't take this model
very seriously. No matter. Prepare for Suspension of Disbelief,
take a deep breath... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...<P>

To access the other facets of the INFINITE SELF the doorway which
needs to be opened is the faculty of Dreaming:<P>

While sleeping dreams can be controlled by visualization, sigils
and mantras, the waking dream is by far the most potent. Waking
dreams range from normal fantasy and day-dreaming, to the Creative
Vertigo wherein one may slip into a borderline psychosis. It is
easier to 'slip' into such a state and begin to sense what is
happening than to consciously orchestrate such an experience.<P>

I recall one instance of succumbing to this dream-vertigo, whilst
walking around Liverpool one night. I felt detached and calm,
almost blissfully peaceful yet with a growing undercurrent of
panic gnawing away at my mind. Everything seemed imbued with a
special kind of meaning I hadn't felt before. It was tantalizing,
mocking me in its evasiveness. Revealed yet concealed in the movements
of the cars and the traffic lights. A message from beyond, but
not quite strong enough to break through. The realisation came
- that the contact was another aspect of SELF attempting to influence
me. A parallel incarnation within a different reality. The vertigo
gripped me and I staggered back home. That night I dreamed of
our meeting - He thought me and eidolon of the past, I knew him
as a foreshadowing of a possible future.<P>

By intensely re-running memory [pause, rewind] I found a common
point from which our facets diverged. This occurred a month ago,
when I left my job as a bookshop assistant. "He" was
still working there, and as I discovered this, I became trapped
in "his" reality, dreaming that I was he, dreaming about
me. Reality became frayed at this point.<P>

Now I was no longer sure which reality I was inhabiting, but was
able to hurl my awareness across Time to glimpse other facets
of my INFINITE SELF. Were they as disturbed as I, I wondered?
A very thin tightrope to be walked indeed. In both waking and
sleeping Dream I was hurled across facets, some of them utterly
incomprehensible to me. In one dream I stared into a corridor
of mirrors and watched my other forms come and go. Waking hours
were punctuated by bouts of memory loss... Our name is Legion.
Momentum building up as I leapt between spaces.<P>

Such is the nature of Dreaming Across Time. The theory of parallel
incarnations is not important in itself. It enabled me to enter
and explore a state of "Creative Derangement", part
of which I have just described. To enter in and lose one's sense
of SELF and thereby evoke the potentiality of "Otherness",
be they human or non-human.<P>
