<H1>Cacodemonic Copulations</H1>
<H3>by Phil Hine</H3>

<HR>

The subject of Incubi and Succubi and their visitations is rarely
dealt with by modern magical writers, although they have been
used time and time again by various hacks of the horror genre.
Sex-Demons have been banished - either explained away as hallucination
or junked as a product of Christian mastubatory mythos. Any occultists
this side of the twentieth-century that do mention them, usually
do so in the context of warning against traffick with such entities,
believing that the dangers of loss of vitality or obsession is
the inevitable result.<P>

One of the few modern magical writers who does look at incubi
and succubi (or, succubi and succuboys), is William Burroughs:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>...an incubus or succubus can be harmless, or it can be destructive.
Like any sexual situation, the danger depends on how you handle
it. All sex is potentially dangerous .... Our sexual feelings
make us vunerable. How many people have been ruined by a sexual
partner? Sex does provide a point of invasion and the succubi
and incubi simply makes us intensely aware of this.<BR></I>
--from, A Report from the Bunker (V. Bockris.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

In the novel, <I>The Place of Dead Roads,</I> protagonist Kim
Carsons enjoys several encounters with sex-demons:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>He knew that the horror of these Demon Lovers was a gloomy
Christian thing. In Japan there are phantom lovers known as fox
maidens, and the man who can get his hands on a fox maiden is
considered lucky. He felt sure that there were fox boys as well.
Such creatures could assume the form of either sex.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

According to Burroughs, peoples attitudes towards these beings
may change, but such visitations are probably more frequent than
most people suppose. He classes them as a type of familiar (they
certainly are!) and notes that, like animal or elemental familiars,
they are dependent on a relationship with a human host for their
own development. Similar ideas can be found in the Kaula school
of Tantrika, where there are rites for contacting such beings.
The general approach is that you fuck them and they do you a favour
in return. Burroughs speculates on the possibilities of increased
frequency of contact between humans and sex-demons:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Sex is physics. If anyone could push a button an receive an
incubus or succubus, I believe that most people would prefer a
phantom partner than the all-too dreary real thing.</I><BR>

<H3>So How do you Go About Aquiring a Demon Lover?</H3>

<B>The Liminal Gnosis</B><P>

Playing with such entities generally falls into the class of magical
technique known as Evocation, and a form of Gnosis which is often
the most effective is the so-called Liminal state, when one is
half-asleep, half-awake. The body is completely relaxed, either
from a relaxation exercise, or physical exhaustion; yet the mind
is clear, and you simply allow images and sounds to arise before
you. If you can learn to enter and prolong this state, then it
is very useful for scrying, dream control or virtual (astral)
explorations.<P>

<B>Erotic Evocation</B><P>

To prepare for the Evocation of a Demon Lover, seek to inflame
yourself through all possible modes of sensory stimulation - books,
films, pornographic material, the diffusion of perfumes that have
erotic association, body massage, masturbation without orgasm
- any technique which serves to heighten your sexual arousal globally
- that is, without being directed to any particular individual
(real or imaginary).<P>

The Evocatory scenario is a progression of intense sessions which
may begin as follows:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Lie naked on your bed - the room is in darkness, but for the
glow of a single candle. You have bathed and relaxed yourself.
Seductive perfumes are diffused throughout the room and you have
prepared the space as though you are about to receive a lover.
Slowly, begin to caress yourself, intensely feeling each touch,
each shiver of pleasure; imagining that the touch comes from an
invisible lover who hovers above you. Concentrate at first on
secondary erogenous zones when inflaming yourself, and stay as
relaxed as possible. Any significant dream-images that follow
such a session should be recorded.
<LI>Repeat this experience, gradually allowing yourself to become
increasingly excited, and slowly visualize the build-up of a shadowy
form - fingers, lips, breast, thighs - parts of the lovers body
which come into fleeting contact with your own. As you repeat
the experience, associations will form between sensory stimuli
and it can be helpful if you can create a special scent which,
while having erotic associations, is unique for this operation.
You should also take care to note any particular body postures
and gestures (caresses) that you find yourself making - these
can act as sensual asanas and mudras for the operation.
<LI>The final session of this sequence proceeds as above, but
<I>slowly</I> allow yourself to approach orgasm. If you are experienced
enough, and in touch with your body enough to allow yourself to
hover on the brink of orgasm for as long as possible, then so
much the better. As you approach orgasm, begin to vocalise love-noises,
letting these sounds become glossolalia - until a distinct sound
(it may or may not be an actual word) begins to repeat itself
through you. As you attain orgasm, project this sound into the
shadow-form above you, and see the shadow-form becoming distinct
and clear. You may find that details of the entity which have
been hitherto indistinct, will become clear in the illuminating
flashes of orgasm. Sexual fluids released in this working can
form the basis of a material sigil, but this is optional.
</OL>
<P>

<H3>Now that You've Evoked me here, what are we going to do?</H3>

Having gone through the process of evoking a Demon Lover, what
can you actually do with them? The first point to consider is
the states in which interaction with the entity takes place. What
little magical writing there is on the subject tends to concentrate
on Dream Magick, but it is also possible to continue using the
Liminal Gnosis and, an often-undervalued area of magick, Working
with Mirrors. There is also the possibility of Invocatory work
with Demon Lovers.<P>

<B>Dream Yoga</B><P>

Once you have evoked your demon lover, you can choose to interact
with it through dreams. One of the easiest techniques of Dream
Control is to use a sigil. Since Im sure most people are familiar
with the basics of Sigil Magick, I will merely draw your attention
to the point that a sigil need not be either a glyph or mantra,
but can also take the form of a scent, or sequence of images.
You can use earlier practice in the Liminal Gnosis to launch a
sigil to meet your Demon Lover in your dreams. You could even
try and key the appearance of the entity to the triggering of
a Lucid Dream.<P>

<B>Liminal Gnosis</B><P>

If your earlier practice has been successful, you will already
have some experience of the Liminal Gnosis. Sexual Arousal is
but one of the entry-routes into this state, and you might try
and find other routes. Interaction with the Demon-Lover can be
made in this state, and you might find here that you get dreams
which follow-through the encounter.<P>

<B>Mirror-Magick</B><P>

The Liminal Gnosis can be enhanced by the use of a mirror. The
use of reflective surfaces for interacting with entities has a
long and venerable history, ranging from shamanic practices among
the Moari, Pawnee and Nkomis of Africa, to the explorations of
Dr. John Dee. Demon-Lovers may be summoned into a mirror, where
they may be cross-examined. A cautionary note here is that Dr.
Dee made the claim that from time to time, one of the spirits
he contacted - a young girl called Midimi - would emerge from
his scrying crystal and cavort about his study This could have
interesting possibilities when working with a Demon Lover!<P>

Whichever states you choose to explore, the next consideration
is of course, what you are going to do. Well, the very act of
experimenting with this approach should in itself be instructive,
and at the very least, enjoyable. However, the following applications
for Demon Lover work include:<P>

<B>Enchantment</B><P>

Here, you are basically forming a Pact with the entity - using
it as you would use any other kind of Sorcery Servitor - you fuck
it and it carries out its assigned task (which is not necessarily
confined to the sphere of sexuality). One technique is to seed
the entity with a sigil, which will gestate within the body of
the entity, in a similar manner to a wishing box.<P>

<B>Illumination</B><P>

According to Austin Osman Spare, desires are spirits that wish
to incarnate. You can deploy a Demon Lover to assist you with
the formulation of an Alphabet of Desire, wherein each sacred
letter can become a sex-demon in itself, to be used in acts of
self-exploration and self-modification. Your Demon Lover can assist
you in recognizing, binding, and integrating the hidden demons
of your psyche which relate to sexuality and other primal drives.<P>

<B>Divination</B><P>

Divinatory applications include dream-oracles, or flash-gnoses
which may extend into the waking state. You may find, for example,
that, following a request for a dream-oracle, your demon lover
only gives you half the key, as it were. The other half is waiting
in the waking world - some incident that sparks a moment of gnosis
in which you realise the link between thought/emotion and some
physical object or situation. Oracles are rarely straight-forwards.<P>

<B>Invocation</B><P>

Traditional magical theory (such as it is) tends to frown on invoking
entities such as Demon Lovers, as they are not considered to have
enough of a developed persona to make it worthwhile. However,
long-term magical use of such an entity does tend to build up
the appearance of an independent persona, particularly if you
make careful note of any quirks, personality traits, or mannersims
that the entity seems to be displaying. I see no reason why, at
some stage, you shouldnt try invocatory work with a Demon Lover.
It could be instructive, if only for shifting latent sexual selves
into the directors chair of the Ego.<P>

<H3>A Word of Warning</H3>

The practice of intercourse with Demon Lovers is not without its
dangers. The most obvious of these is obsession. In its broadest
sense, obsession is the term we apply to a situation where the
magician has relinquished will to an entity (usually of his own
creation). Obsessions with a sexual component are particularly
difficult to deal with - anyone who has had an obsessional crush
on someone else will know what I mean. Sex, like anything else,
can become an addiction which erodes the will. Intercourse with
Demon Lovers is no exception, so self-discipline at all times,
is important. Although a Demon Lover can generate a great deal
of fascination and erotic tension, this should only be employed
as a source of gnosis and magical work, and not allowed to get
out of control. It can be useful to only use the entity for specific
projects, and then, at staggered intervals. Intercourse with these
entities <I>can</I> be exhausting. This is not so much due to
any vampiric quality on their part, but is related to working
in unusual states of consciousness - similar problems arise with
extended astral, dream, or liminal work.<P>

Another problem relating to this work is also fairly obvious -
that the Demon Lover becomes a substitute for a physical partner.
As with any relationship between human and entity (be it demon
or deity), it is useful to assume its independent existence -
if only during the interaction. However, I have seen warnings
in a variety of magical grade papers that hint of the dire consequences
of giving these entities the same regard that you would a human
lover. By the same token, conjuring a Demon Lover for the precise
reason that you lack a human lover is tantamount to inviting obsession,
with all the attendant problems. As success with this technique
requires an appreciation of your own sensuality, bodily awareness,
sexual feelings and orgasmic response, it should not be attempted
by the overly frustrated, or the sexually inept or inexperienced.<P>

This practice should also lead to a wider appreciation of your
sexual being and possible range of sexual identities. If you have
sealed disturbing elements of your sexuality behind blocks, then
you might well find that this practice leads you into a situation
where you have to confront these experiences. This may not be
pleasant, but can be, if you allow it, instructive, and possibly
healing.<P>

If, for whatever reason, you <I>do</I> find that working with
a Demon Lover brings up problems that you find difficult to handle,
then there are basically three strategies which can be brought
up. The first is to perform a thorough Banishing of the area you
are using for this practice (i.e. bedroom). Secondly, you can
evoke the entity and confine it into a spirit trap such as a triangle,
bottle, or crystal, and ritually re-bind it to your will. Thirdly,
there is the option of reabsorption, which can be performed as
a ritual or within the Liminal Gnosis. The simplest approach here
is to take back the entities name, destroy any material base,
visualise the emotions/sensations/abilities you may have bestowed
upon it as withdrawing back into your body and finally (and this
<I>can</I> be difficult) denying it any sexual response or erotic
association. Then, go and have a cold shower.<P>
