IMSVHO, you might already be doing some banishing you're just not aware
of. Banishing doesn't have to be a formal complex set of instructions,
involving visualization/mantra vibration, like the LBRP (if you're into
kabbalistic symbolisms), Gnostic Pentagram R, or Gnostic Thunderbolt R. It
can be as simple as S. Mace's banishing ritual from "Stealing the Fire
from Heaven", <imagining a vertical column of white light along your
body's axis, another circle of light along the horizontal (transverse)
axis on eye level, and 2 ellipses of light along your body's length at
right angles to each other (coronal and sagittal planes), and imagining
the vertical light expanding outwards through the 3 rings of light, at the
same time imagining "cleaning out your imagination ">. It can be so simple
as clapping your hands (number varies: the Japanese does one clap during
business deals, M.K. does it 3 times, Zen masters with one hand) or just
banishing with laughter. BWAHAHAHAHA. <P>

Again, IMSVHO, I do a banishing not only to get rid of unwanted influences
(that could interfere with my work; and for protection) but also to get
rid of my obsessive thoughts, sort of grounding/centering myself as a
signal that I am about to embark upon a 'special' ritual ("concentration
trigger"). Aura-wise, banishing can "expand" your aura (DM Kraig) by
"causing people to like you and respect you more, and come to you for
comfort." (hearing my sinister mind, ting-ting-ting-ting-ting,
"babe-magnet" &gt;;). According to S. Mace, it can "harden" your aura
"forming a psychic shell that will keep your consciousness together and
deflect the piercing intrusions of the external world...an aura so hard
that he[she] will be able to drop many of the defensive habits that might
have attached themselves to his[her] personal attitude." In fact, Mace
recommended doing it "4-5 times a day for the rest of your life." <P>

So, as a kid, I always make it a habit, not only to brush my teeth, but to
do banishing often/daily.<P>

Just my 2 centavos.<P>

All the Best, <P>
