The term Pandæmonæon is bandied about a great deal by Chaos Magicians. The
word itself seems to have been coined by Peter Carroll but, like the concept
of gnosis, it is not a new idea. The same idea runs through ancient Indian
thought as pralaya, for example. Pandæmonæon is, in fact, the "end of the
world" -- at least in terms of anything recognizable to us as a society or
civilization. Speculations on particulars of how it might manifest abound,
but such exercises are a bit silly, since there are no particulars possible
within Pandæmonæon itself!<P>

The most important aspect regards the nature of information and its
transference. At present, the speed at which information may be transmitted
from source to target is bound by time, which manifests here as the speed of
light. This, however, is an illusory restriction. Information is not
manifested matter, and thus does not fall under the domain of the "universal
laws of physics" that appear to govern the behavior of the medium through
which it is transferred. To simplify this, one need only imagine the
telephone. While it may appear that information is transferred
instantaneously, this is not in fact the case. There is a time lag between
departure from the information's source and receipt by the target which is
dictated by the speed of an electrical transmission through a wire, or light
through a fiber optic cable. In other words, the information must first be
converted into something material and then moved through some other matter.
Ultimately, it is not information that is moved; it is electrons or photons,
which are then converted back into information when they arrive at their
target. But the information itself is not the electron or photon (although
these do contain and are composed of information). Information, as it now
stands, cannot be measured on its own. It is an intangible to us, something
that can never be experienced directly.<P>

So then, what is information? It is what the ancient shaman might have
called mana. It is not material, nor is it energy. Lacking a better cognate
for the idea, it can best be described as æthyr; dispersed quanta that bind
together temporarily to form a phenomena of any sort. Æthyr is not bound by
the speed of light, does not itself occupy space, and is not subject to
time. It is quite capable of being in more than one place at a time, or
nowhere at all, or any combination of the two.<P>

Pandæmonæon, then, is at one level the breaking down of all things into
æthyr, or information. Everything becomes temporary agglomeration changeable
at will, with will itself being understood as a transient agglomeration.
This mirrors exactly the process by which any act of Chaos Magick is
effected; one sets up a set of parameters beforehand through various
techniques, but the techniques in themselves are not magick. Intentional
magick can be manifested only when a state of Gnosis is achieved. Gnosis is
the scattering of the mind back into the æthyric pool through the cessation
of all mental process. Any number of variables (quanta) are then
interchanged between the magickal Worker and the infinite field of
infinitesimal potentialities (Æthyr). The form they will take in
manifestation is determined by the parameters set to a great extent by the
techniques employed. In other words, the techniques act in much the same was
as the telephone line did in the previous example. When Pandæmonæon has been
invoked, however, such intermediate steps are no longer necessary. Will
directly manipulates the æthyr into various configurations, and nothing
exists but that which has been so configured. Information is transmitted,
processed and configured outside of the bounds of any concept of time, and
thus instantaneously.<P>

What effect, then, does this have upon humanity's social structures? It must
first be understood that any social structure is nothing more than the
product of mental processes. These can be changed at the whim of those who
participate in a given structure. Furthermore, social structures of any kind
are attempts to control the transmission and manifestation of information
and the æthyr. It is always through the visor of his social structures that
man forms consensual reality. Pandæmonæon, then, is implicitly the collapse
of all social structures, as there can no longer be any medium through which
the information is transmitted. In other words, all of the æthyr is
accessible instantaneously at every point in infinite quantity. The
boundaries of social constructs, and indeed the individual mind, swell to
bursting. Every subject and every object are united; individuality and
group, past, present and future all collapse into a singularity that is
infinite, unbounded and in a constant state of flux. All separation of
concepts vanish along with all concept of separation. Spare terms this a
state of neither/neither; E.E. Rehmus terms it an eschatonic implosion;
eastern mysticism proclaims it unity with godhead. They are all, in fact,
one and the same.<P>

Thus, it must be the goal of the Chaos Magician to remove every barrier to
the transmission of information. Hierarchies are to be overthrown not just
for the sake of doing so, but to hasten the arrival of Pandæmonæon via the
destruction of such barriers. Any organization, regardless of its aims, is
an anti-Pandæmonæonic force if it seeks to control the flow of any
information whatsoever. Governments, communications networks, religious
institutions and secret societies all fall into this category. The true
Chaos Magician will not seek to withhold information on techniques of
magick, nor form secretive Illuminati-like societies that create oligarchies
and bureaucracies that are every bit as restrictive as the ones that they
purport a desire to obliterate. Instead, any such information must be
disseminated as quickly and as widely as possible; this not only hastens the
Pandæmonæon directly in that it has sped up transmission a bit more, but
also insures that others may find and use the techniques necessary to
perform the Great Work themselves. Anything else cannot be Chaos Magick as
to do otherwise is to hinder the invocation of the Pandæmonæon.<P>
