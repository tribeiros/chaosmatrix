<B>Subject:</B> Excerpts from the ZMA-lectures. (fwd)<P>

<HR><P>

The following excerpts were taken from lectures held by that now dissolved
entity known as the ZMA during its stay in Redknap, Ohio in 1962. The
lectures were given in 3 hour sessions, followed by questions from and
answers to the audience. The texts below were recorded by that famous
student of the occult, Lasse Marhaug, who later went on to become the
supreme leader of the extreme and fanatic Icecream-cult, popularly called
the Scandinavian Ismai'ils.  Later exerpts may or may not be released
according to the whims of the invisible masters.<P>

<H3>ZMA-LECTURES, #1</H3>

	&lt;beginning of tape, static crackle, swearing by recorder&gt;<P>

Whoopee, dear students of the universe, and well met here at the College
Invisible. Due to your scheduled professors unlucky and tragic demise in a
horrible polarbear-accident, it is my sad and happy duty to replace his
subject issue "Practical use of Majikal Buerocracy to ensure a Qlipothik
Unity of no-thing" with my own somewhat less serious issue "Songs the Lord
taught me, or: Tricks of wearing the pointy hat".In other words, I'll talk
about whatever pleases me, and youll be gracefully allowed to ask questions
afterwards. First, let me say a few things about presentational and
argumentational techniques. Many inside these fields seem to lay great
weight in dressing their musings into the fields of strangeness either in a
a pseudo scientific-rational way of speaking, with a building of a
hypothesis, a presentation of "evidence", a judgement of the results
gleaned from such and then a conclusion, in the ravings of sheer old
fashioned religious ecstatic symbolism or in the usage of a complicated
technical language derived from the kabbalah and its myriads of
possibilities. To this I say, PooEee with a bell on. My way of presenting
things, wich is of course the only and supreme way of presenting things, is
through what I have coined and trademarked "ZMAs technique of structural
resonant memetic associative constructivism", in other and more serious
words, I prefer to use the communicative model used in Tolkiens mythic
works, the model of Keyphrases and points, of repetitious symbolism in
different guise and presented in different styles, to different audiences,
as a sort of personal symbolistic montage aimed at being a construct in
itself, much as each fold of the paper makes up the Origami crane. Nothing
is Truth, All is Permitted, Consequence Judgement, Competence
Satisfaction.<P>

	Yeah, rightyho. First, about Majik: It works. Booo. How it works,
is a rather different question. Heres a few theories: One is that all
exists within a condition of different harmonies, and that man through
harmonic alignement of Self with harmonic alignement of Other can affect
this Other in a strutural way, causing change to be manifested in said
Other. Its the old mystical Aristotelean example, a stick is a stick until
it touches fire, then it aint no stick no more but a burning stick and as
such to be classified as having changed, of being subject to another
formulational truth if you want. Here we enter into the old hermetic game
of dominant and resistant forces, application of force and so on. The
endpoint of this line of argument seems to be the acceptance of some
mystical schtuff called variously NRG, phlogiston, Maya or pure and
simple...eh...stuff wich changes other stuff, a sort of master elixir that
exists within and without and wich is as it is. Another is that mans
perception is subjective, and so a mans creation of perspective and
subsequent etrance into gnosis, a state of being sure of what they are
doing while they are doing it, may cause reality to change in some
fundamental way, its the popular "Breaking the walls of the
space-time-continuum" theory, reality as a consensual hallusination based
on the continual input and acceptance of said input, the universe being in
a continual state of talking to itself. the faultline here is, of course,
that this implies that if noone is around to see the tree fall, not only
does it not make a sound but it actually does not fall, and if the squirrel
nearby is not able to formulate the experience of loosing a shitload of
nuts, those nuts quite simply aint lost. A variant, and even more mystical
one, is good ole Eckhardts theory of the Word, wich I cant say to have
understood properly but wich seems to imply that the Word of th beholder is
a reflection gained from beholding a subjective interpretation of the Word
of the reciever, wich leads very easily into the pitfall of absolute
subjectivism and its subsequent centrance around Ego as the only known
fact, a position wich the experience of Other seems to me to deny the
comfortable plausibility of. Then theres the practicalist variant, to wich
Im a subscriber, that majik is the Artof talking to the universe in words
that she cannot ignore, that man is through hirs posessionon of the
cognitive ability in a state of communication with the Other wich can be
termed Life. This does imply a weird sense of animistic/pantheistic
practical approach to mysticisms one point of Recognition, in that it
states that the Act of Formulation causes the Formulation to become a
possibility, and in some cases such a possibility will become the Fact.<P>

This, to me, leads to my personal paradigmal theory, wich at the moment is
divided into the thoughts concerning Ka and Ki, and wich runs as follows:
The natural flow of things can be called the great river of Ka, much in the
way of the Tao, and in the perfect state of Ka there exists a balance.
There also exists a possibility for action, and this possibility can be
called the Ki. Within a perfect state of Ka Ki would be a part of the
natural flow, the leap of the cat towards the mouse, the picking of a
lifemate, the sharing of bananas among the tribe. Somewhere along the line,
however, man gained the ability to cause Change, a ability wich can be
called Choice, and through this ability he gained also the ability to
change the patterns of Ka through the consequences of his actions. Man, in
other words, got inflicted with the possibility of inflicting structural
Change, as opposed to superficial or temporary Change. Magi, or the Art,
can be said to use the Free Choice of applied Ki to make a formulation of
reality in accordance with the dreams and longings of the formulator.<P>

	&lt;muttering of recorder:mumble mumble intellectualist asshole
mumble mumble what about action mumble mumble<gt;<P>

	This again has lead me to the following distinctions, wich are of
strictly personal nature and not in any way universalist dogma: Theres
three basic ways of talking to She who enfolds us, two of wich seek to
cause change and one wich seeks to uphold that wich is. Using the Harmonic
image we can call these patterns Harmonic increase/decrease, Disharmonic
increase/decrease and Harmonic/Disharmonic continuation. Earlier in my
glorious and amazingly fabolous career, I labeled these Majik, MagicK and
Magi. Using the communicational model, one may say that the first is the
Art of poetic seduction, the second the Art of command and the third the
Art of Mantric Repetition. A "magical spell" is , basically, a formulation
wich is aimed at some other,a nd to me these seem to be usable categories
within wich to put such communications. Im willingly here trying to avoid
all use of judgemental language. It is my personal and subjective view,
however,t hat the usage of force as is traditional in the Lux-based
workings of modern ceremonial magiCK, are based on a combination of
Disharmonic continuation and Disharmonic increase, in other words that most
ritual spells of the classical type seems to bestructured around a
foundation of mantric repetition mounting in a culminative display of the
Art of Command, and it is in my belief that most of these acts are if not
just rude then dangerous to the very essence that it employs, insofar as
there seems to exist a deep connection between the formulator and that wich
is formulated, so that just as the magician is shaped by the ritual in more
ways than he/she knows, so the very essence of the magic itself that he/she
performs &lt;at the very least, egregoric in its extreme&gt;  gets changed
in return in some sort of mutual reaction.<P>

	&lt;Shouts from audience: Get on with, ya European
cocksucker!&gt;<BR>
	&lt;laughter&gt;<P>

		**break in tape**<P>

...When discussing moral issues and the question of the Law, I kinda think
its important to remember that these are subject to the dictates of power,
tho. As an example: A anarchist contact of mine, Luigi, is a righteous man,
a vegetarian, a stout friend, works for free among the poor, etc. Yet, he
particpates in mass-shoplifting actions, where hundreds of people storm
into a chainrun-shopping mall and takes all they can carry with them away.
This he does from a considered strategical position, and from his
consideration of the world. Three times he has gone to jail, once for this,
once for refusing to serve in the army and refusing to say that he is a
pacifist in order to get away with it, and once for being in a occupied
house. All three times the Law has been against him. Lets examine these
crimes: One is theft, and a clear case of a breaking of the social
contract. One is pride, and a refusal to bow the head to those in a
position of superior power. One is for comradeship and a reaction to the
injustice of the political and economical structures, who let houses stand
empty yet keep people homeless. When my friend states that the same forces,
the structural powerpeople are both responsible for the largescale shopping
malls, the military armsindustial complex and the homelessness, it can be
argued that all these three actions are a consequence of a refusal to be a
part of this structure. Is this then, the refusal through pride to accept
the common demnominator enforced by the Powers a crime? Are all of these
excusable? None? These are interesting questions to me, morally. The
"common" drugaddict white middleclass suburban punk doesnt give shit, isnt
worth shit and would never stand tall against anything except in a mob,
this is a fact of life. But its interesting to note that the Law is posed
as a cornerstone of the state, yet it functions in different ways for
different people, and is most severe aginst those who try to oppose the
majority by creation of alternatives while it is most sympathic to those
who work within the structures of Power. &lt;Remember Irangate?&gt;<P>

	&lt;Shout from the audience: Sophist Buuuuullshit!&gt;<P>

Hmm , I seem to be wandering aimlessly. I guess my personal conclusion is
rather a dangerous one, and one wich I have tried to escape, actually. You
very easily get to the conclusion that "Man is responsible for his own sad
to see that very many conclude this sentence with "Love is the Law,
&lt;but&gt; Love Under Will", seeming to imply that ruling principle must
be that of reason and calculated correctness and not one of personal
rigidity. If Will, in its "Hegelian" sense, in other words Will as a entity
&lt;egregore?&gt; composed of lesser Wills acting in unison, is to be put
before the Individuals personal Love, i.e. personal "Knowledge of Rightness
of the Universe" then such a Will is , to me, tyrannical and not in
accordance with my personal view. I do not know wether you are familiar
with diverse occult and "secret" societies, I am not personally a memeber
of any organized hierarchical structire like this. I do know, however, that
it is usual to pledge allegiance to an authority within such a order. I
prefer the Assasin oath of allegiance myself, wich is rather one of
negative assertance, that one promises not to lie, not to attack and not to
betray the trust of ones brothers, leaving Self free to choose to
participate in actions or not. It seems, to me, that one of the main ideas
of such organizations, and of mainstream religions, and individuals trying
to "make" it in the world,w ether through "alternative" or through
"mainstream" channels, is that they seem to accept the premises and the
Word as it is presented to them so that they become servants before the
Power instead of Actors within the world. Now, in my travel I have met men
who stood against, and in some places they were still standing, but in
mnost places they were falling minto despair and misery and drunkenness and
woe, qlipothik sadness and decay of hollowness, and it is this wich is sad
to behold and it is this that I can not make myself condemn. Yes, people
should be standing, and Ive been howling for four years now for one true
man among the already competents to step forward and do something brave,
but Ive yet to see one practical tactical move inside the socalled "occult"
world using the knowledge gained these last thirty years concerning the
usage of television, sound and symbols for a positive aim. Thats why I
personally steal chocolates now and then, not because of need but out of
anger that you need to kiss someones feet in order to get them for free,
and it seems to me that the keepers of this chocolate are Evil, either
mindlessly or directed.<P>

&lt;Loud booing from the audience, sound of massive contigent getting up
and leaving&gt;<P>

**break in tape**<P>

\\Transcribers note\\: According to eye-witnesses,at this point 92,5 % of
the originally massive and diverse audience had got up and left under loud
shouts of sarcastic threats. \\Transcribers note ended\\<P>

&lt;cough&gt; Hehehe, and now that our impatient brethern have departed,
let us get serious. There is but one god, and her name is Allah.  I make no
claim to be a secret imam, nor do I make a claim to be a da'i, but I do
consider myself at least partly initiated by now and as such may divulge
those practical secrets wich I see fit in order to achieve my aims.
Therefore, I would direct your attention to Hassan-I-Sabbahs original plan
for the development of a effective structural organisation, and point out
that to him, philosophy was the end point of the initiationprocess and
something to be performed as a leisurely pursuit, inbetween the actions
performed by the brethern of the Ismai'il.<P>

&lt;raises voice&gt; Our aim has always been sevenfold, for seven is the
sacred number, and four is at its base and three at its top and in the
middle is the one wich is nill and all, yet both and because, and the way
to the three goes by the four through the one. The four can be said to
represent the elements, and its political aspects are as follows: Earth is
the building of strongholds and the keeping of safety of the hold that is
the Tribe, Air is the understanding and application of the three sisters
Word, Image and Sound, Fire is the understanding of the Matter in wich one
burns and application of such an action and Water is the understanding of
the understanding of the movements of Life in all its aspects and the
bringing forth of such Life. Having succesfully gained this base, the
candidate may approach the One wich is naugh yet all and wrestle it to the
ground, filling it with that wich is True, causing the alchemic reaction of
turning neither/nor into Both/And, wich is the formulae wich allows safe
entry into the realms of Three.. All is True, Nothing is Permitted,
Consequence Measurement, Competence Satisfaction.  There is but one God,
and his name is Allah.<P>

&lt;The voice of lecturer has through this sermonlike monologue gone lower
and lower, ending almost in a whisper. There follows one minute of Silence,
broken by laughter from lecturer&gt;.<P>

	O.K., hands up who thinks Im initiated into something. Hehe,
thought so. See how easy it is to conceal truths in gibberish, and
gibberish in truths? Lemme tell you the real secret of secrets, people.
There aint no secret brotherhood, or if there ever was theyve all been
fried on the astral by the detonation of the nuclear charges these last
years. The responsibility is ours, and its open. You, there, whats your
name, you look like youve had an idea for some time, lemme use my
clairvoyant powers and discern them in good olefashioned quakerstyle, lemme
guess, youre planning to go hitchhiking to New York, become a folksinger,
turn into the main hero of the beatgeneration and spread the meme of poetic
consciousness into the generation of the postwar stress, reflecting your
astral dreams as best you can? Good on ya, mate, go for it, though I think
it will end in despair for you. You see, everybody, there seems to be this
condition that follows with the opening of the first gate that
communication of ideas is virtually impossible, that a secret doctrine is
protected by the very idea of the secret doctrine itself, a guardian
wichfor me always turns out as a bull whenever I wrestle him in my dreams,
and wich seems to twist the words of the communicator into patterns that
s-he did not see. This is the trap were facing, along with those of being
swallowed by the Selfs Word and the difficulty of finding two men who are
willing to work together for anything but money. Well, Ive found the
solution to this, and here it<P>

**End of tape**<P>

//Transcribers note//Here, unfortunately, the tape was switched off and
onemay only guess what wonders were transmitted for the next half hour.
Sufficient it is to say that Lasse Marhaug went on to establish Norways
perhaps most powerful lodge during the seventies, the dreaded AKP-ML who
through their ritualistic political strength shook the very bones of
Norwegian society to their core.//Transcribers Note ended///<P>
