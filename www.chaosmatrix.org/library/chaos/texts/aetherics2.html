Aetherics is, simply put, energy manipulation.  But it's a lot more
complicated than it sounds.  Many systems
of magick deal with energy manipulation: various aspects of psi and
psychic abilities, qi qong, reiki, pranayama,
and other magickal disciplines all deal in one sense or another with the
concept of the manipulation of subtle
currents.  These currents are usually manipulated via various mental
disciplines including visualization and
imagination.  One visualizes the energy flowing through one's body, and
at the same times 'feels' it moving,
acting, changing.  This energy can then be lent further power by
attributing various correspondences of meaning to
it.  For instance an aetheric current might be felt as warm or cool, hot
or cold, or visualized in any number of
colors, flowing in any number of manners, and it may be 'felt' in any
number of different ways.  For example, a
warm red current that manifests in the form of flowing flames and feels
itchy or burning might be the aetheric
equivalent of fire.  As another example, I often imagine the aetheric
quality of strength as thin solid rays of
steely flesh-pink energy.  I associate no temperature, or perhaps room
temperature with this phenomena.  It is
important to feel and not merely see the energy flowing.<BR><BR>

I will not offer any specific correspondences for color or other
attributes of aetheric energy, because I am a
firm believer in personalized magick being the strongest; so use your
own correspondences, ones that have meaning
for you.<BR><BR>

Through extended glamoury, the application of aetherics can prove
quite potent indeed.  Qi qong masters are
often reported to be able to knock people over at a distance, cause
paper or fabric to spontaneously combust, or
even to be able to levitate.  I have yet to hone my skills to such
levels, but I certainly don't doubt that such
abilities are possible.<BR><BR>

Keep in mind also that you can manipulate more than your own
energies -- draw in energy from your
surroundings, or specific targets to add to your power.  The subject of
psychic vamprirism often attracts people
who are new to magick or psychic abilities.  Psychic vampirism involves
feeding upon another's energy, usually, but
not always, via aetheric means.  A word of caution: Probably somewhere
in the range of 90% of 'psychic
vampirism attacks' are only in the mind of the victim.  Usually a simple
banishing will solve the problem in either
case.<BR><BR>

A great exercise for drawing in aetheric energy is an adaptation of
a grounding ritual a friend once explained
to me:  Envision 'roots' extending from you in all directions, perhaps
at random, perhaps in a certain pattern,
perhaps even forming a fractal design.  Now draw in all beneficial
energies from your environment through these
'roots,' making sure to withdraw the roots afterwards.  Feel refreshed?
It is effectively a simple and quick
invokation ritual.  (As per LIRP.)  Similarly, to banish, after
extending your 'roots' project through them and
away from you all harmful or negative energies you may have
accumulated.  You may then withdraw the 'roots' or draw
in beneficial energies first.<BR><BR>

In any event, this was only meant as a very rudimentary and cursory
overview of aetheric theory and practice.
Take the ideas, develop the techniques, and share with others what you
discover!<BR><BR>
