<H1>The Demiorgeous, Blind Idiot God</H1>
<H2>by Coyote 63</H2>

<HR>

The Gnostics claimed that the god of the Old Testament was
only a half-god created to make the material world, while
the real god, who was pure spirit, could not create the
material world. The Gnostics mixed pagan magick with Angelic
magic. They believed that souls had to earn their salvation
with magick, then they would go beyond the false god of the
materila world. Simon Zealot started his own gnostic sect
after the crucifixion. He worshipped himself as Zeus and his
wife as Hera. they were known as the Simonians.<P>

The Blind Idiot God would go on making the material world in
the same fashion it always had until some adept reprogrammed
it with ritual which would turn the world into paradise. The
Ritual Process was to imagine yourself to be the creator god
and then look down at your mortal self and shower yourself
with blessings and gifts. You could also imagine the god
destroying your enemies and parasites. So now you can go out
and make your own Demiorgeous!<P>

Aren't you glad that god doesn't have to be a blind idiot
anymore?<P>

<H3>Jehova was a formula</H3>

Yes, it's true! Jehova, who most people thought was a stern
disciplinarian, was actually a magical formula. However,
this was regarded as a powerful secret, known only to
gnostic priests and rabbis. In fact, if one understood the
formula of Jehovah, it gave that person complete mastery of
reality, and the ability to gain every desire. If one reads
the scriptures and understands that Jehova's children means
the lucky people who knew the esoteric secrets that gave
them true liberty, the meaning comes out quite differently.<P>

The four letters of YHVH stood for hand-window-nail-hand.
The first hand stood for a real desire. The window stood for
the step of taking a desire and visualizing it as clearly
and completely as possible in focus and in all five senses.
The Nail stood for the charging of the visualization with a
strong feeling of joy and fulfillment. One nails the picture
to the wall of reality with a strong feeling of confidence.
Then the visualization is forgotten as completely as
possible to avoid the kind of anxiety referred to as lust of
result. This can be done many ways. An easy way is to put it
in a bubble and watch it float away. Although the formula is
not for manipulating certain Individuals, it can be used for
types of Individuals. The last hand represents your desire
becoming reality.<P>
