===========================================================================

SECTION I: ORIGINS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1   What is Ouranian Barbaric?

Ouranian Barbaric is the proprietary language of chaos magick.  That is, it
is a language, more technically a jargon, that is used exclusively by the
chaos magickal community for use in their workings.  It is not spoken as a
real language, but instead is used in place of the magician's natural
language in order to distract the conscious mind and bypass the psychic
censor.

It has been said that Ouranian Barbaric developed out of a need to express
more modern concepts that were absent in other magickal languages like
Enochian (from the sixteenth century) and relevant to Chaos Magick.  Things
like "Planck's Constant" and "Heisenberg Uncertianty Principle" are
obviously absent from Enochian, which also ommitted some very useful
concepts such as the planets.  Peter Carroll says that he created it
because "I liked the sound of enochian, and I wanted to demon-strate that
an arbitary magical language works just as well as one with a supposedly
mysterious history."


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2   What does the word "Ouranian" mean?

The word "Ouranian" is the adjectivized form of "Ouranos".  Ouranos is an
old form of the word Uranus, and was chosen to avoid the "Your Anus"
stigmatism associated with the modern spelling.

Symbolically, Ouranos is the same as Uranus.  It is harder to describe its
symbology better than in a planetary working called The Ouranos Rite, which
describes it thusly:

    "It is the eighth body, outside of the sphere of classical planets and
     the god forms or thought form attributed to them.  Thus it forms an
     ideal symbol for that which encompasses all the gods within its orbit:
     the magical personality.  It represents not the power of the magic
     itself, which is attributed to Pluto; but rather the desire to be a
     magician, and the personality required to live as one. Astronomically,
     this equates with the curious orbit of Ouranos which, with its polar
     axis tilted at an eccentric angle, almost on the plane of the
     ecliptic, symblolizes the antinomian character of the magician, ever
     delving into that which is weird, occult, and perverse, to unlock its
     secrets.  Ouranos can also be thought of as the dark side of the Sun.
     Whereas the classical bodies orbit the sun, the bright center of human
     personality; Ouranos represents something dark, and perhaps devious,
     creeping round in the darkness outside of the normal."


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3   Why is it called Ouranian "Barbaric"?

As in barbarous words, a term used by Crowley and others.  It is one of the
fundamental concepts of evocatory magick and is an incredibly complicated
subject.  Any language that you don't understand with full consciousness
and that can be chanted in a manner that distracts the conscious mind is
considered to be "barbarous".  In the terms of Chaos Magick, chanting in a
language not understood by the conscious mind (such as Ouranian Barbaric)
lets the ideas (memes) represented by the words bypass the Psychic Censor
and penetrate the subconscious mind of the magician.  Barbarous words can
also serve as foci free of conscious meaning, exalting the mind during
ritual chant.  Crowley says in Chapter IX of "Magick in Theory and
Practice":

    "It may be conceded in any case that the long strings of formidable
     words which roar and moan through so many conjurations have a real
     effect in exalting the consciousness of the magician to the proper
     pitch --- that they should do so is no more extraordinary than
     music of any kind should do so."

Anyone further interested in Barbaric Languages are here referred to
Chapter IX of Aleister Crowley's "Magick in Theory and Practice", and to
Kenneth Grant's "The Magickal Revival."


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4   Where did Ouranian Barbaric come from?

It was created by Peter Carroll and possibly some others around 1989-90.
It was leaked out of the IOT Pact onto the World Wide Web by a disgruntled
former member of the UK Section.  It is not supposed to be in the public
domain, and the IOT has chosen to remain, for the most part, closed-mouthed
about it, even though other chaotes have made extensive use of it and
continue to add to it (see section 3.1)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5   What is the source of the Ouranian Barbaric Dictionaries on the net?

It was leaked onto the World Wide Web by a disgruntled member of the UK
Section of the Illuminates of Thanateros.  Its maintenance has fallen into
the hands of Fenwick Rysen, and the master copy with all updates is
maintained at http://www.chaosmatrix.com/lib/chaos/ob.html

A mirror of this dictionary is maintained by Milos Babic at
http://www.sezampro.yu/~babbage/Ouranian.html

The sources of the words in the updated dictionaries are the original words
created by Peter Carroll with others appended to the list throughout time
by other chaos magicians who created new words to fill any needs that were
not already filled by currently existing words.  Both dictionaries continue
to grow as that language evolves.


===========================================================================

SECTION II: GRAMMAR AND SYNTAX

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1   Does Ouranian Barbaric have a standard syntax?

Properly speaking, Ouranian Barbaric is not a language, but a jargon with
no rules of syntax, sentence structure, or tenses, plurals, or possessives.

It is often said that Ouranian should be written and spoken in V-Prime.  In
his book _Liber Kaos_ Peter Carroll says:

    "It is worth noting here that chaos-magical languages are usually now
     written in V-Prime before transliteration into magical barbaric form.
     V-Prime or Vernacular Prime is one's native tongue in which all use of
     all tenses of the verb "to be" is ommitted in accordance with quantum
     metaphysics.  All the nonsense of transcendentalism disappears quite
     naturally once this tactic is adopted.  There is no being, all is
     doing."

What this means is that you have no forms of the verb "to be" anywhere in
your sentences in Ouranian Barbaric.  Instead, you "do" things.  It is not
"I will die" but instead "I do death".  "There is no being, all is doing."

Other simple rules are that definites articles ("the", "a", etc.) can be
implied such as in Latin, and that when possible things should be in the
present, active tenses.  Should any problems be encountered, one is
reminded that what few rules do exist are not hard and fast.  Feel free to
break them, make your own, or do as spontanaeity urges.  Make the language
your own.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2   Why is the word for "I" and "We" the same?

The reason that "I" and "we" are the same word is derived directly from the
idea of the "multiple nature of the self".  In other words, every
individual is a collection of personas -- a colonial being, if you will.
Furthermore, any collective of personas can also be seen as a single
individual (also with many personas).  Thus, the words I and we are
conceptually equivelant in Ouranian Barbaric.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3   Why are all verbs in the form "do (verb)"?

This has to do with the syntax of Ouranian (see sectin 2.1, above).  This
has to do with the fact that Ouranian has no verb "to be" based on the
anontic concept of no being, and thusly that "there is no being, all is
doing."  There is a subtle change in consciousness that occurs with this
that any magician is advised to pay attention to.  Those interested in the
topic are also encouraged to research E-Prime, a version of English that
eliminates "to be" and its permutations from the vocabulary, accomplishing
the same thing in English that OB does in its grammar.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4   How do I turn Ouranian nouns into verbs,
      adjectives, and adverbs, and vice versa?

Short Answer: However the hell you want to.

Long Answer:  There are no rules.  Make the language yours.  Use the same
word, invent your own prefixes or suffixes, create completely new words,
surrender to spontanaeity, or do whatever else you can think of that feels
right to you.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5   What do the "T+" and "T-" with some of the words mean?

T+ or T- is an indication of whether a word is used in the positive or in
the negative.  Thus when we get the Ouranian word for "Almost Certianly" we
have "UTHEDUS (T+)" and "THOFAD (T-)".  UTHEDUS means "Almost Certianly"
while THOFAD means "Almost Certainly Not."


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.6   Why are Ouranian words always capitalized?

There is no reason.  This is just the standard convention.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.7   How do you pronounce some of these words?

There is no set way to pronounce Ouranian Barbaric words.  It becomes
personal preference, and no two chaotes sound exactly the same when
saying the same words.  Just try your best to sound those stranger ones
out, and go with that.  Most chaotes seem to pronounce a leading "X" (as in
XIQUAL) as a "Z", but this is by no means universal.


===========================================================================

SECTION III: MISCELLANIA

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1   How does one create more Ouranian words?

By creativity.  The general idea is to channel them somehow.  A basic rite
for channeling Ouranian words via glossolalia is available on the web at
http://www.chaosmatrix.com/lib/chaos/rites/gloss.html

It basically goes as follows:  Decide what word you want to add to the
Ouranian language.  Take a bag of scrabble tiles, draw between four and
ten, and use these as a seed word.  Invoke glossolalia, and let the seed
word change and evolve until you arrive at what feels like the proper word.

The original method is through an invocation of Ouranos-Baphomet and then
using a created board to divine the letters of a word.  This ritual is
available at http://www.chaosmatrix.com/lib/chaos/rites/barbget.html

Regardless of method used, the critical part of the process lies in adding
the vowels to the mishmash of consonants that one often receives, whether
this is by inspiration, glossolalia, or other method.  Peter Carroll states
that:

    "Half the trick of barbaric lies with the vowels added at will later,
     for example the phrase "the morning is not the magicians friend"
     yielded VLBZ, which someone wittly pointed up as vulboozo, to rhyme
     with ouzo."


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2   Where can I get a Ouranian Barbaric Dictionary?

The master updated Ouranian Barbaric Dictionary with both English-to-
Ouranian and Ouranian-to-English formats is available on Chaos Matrix at:
http://www.chaosmatrix.com/lib/chaos/texts/obdict2.html

A mirror of this dictionary is maintained by Milos Babic at:
http://www.sezampro.yu/~babbage/Ouranian.html

An English-to-Ouranian only version is maintained by the AutonomatriX:
http://www.sfo.com/~max/newcorpus/barbdicx.htm

Tzimon's older HTML dictionary is no longer updated with new words:
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Gallery/2792/ouranian.html


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3   What should I do with new Ouranian words that I create?

Write them down.  As you create more words, you should add them to your own
personal dictionary.  Many people feel their words are personal, and choose
to keep them to themselves, oftentimes demanding something of great value
before they will divulge them.  However, some other people feel that their
words should be shared with others.  To this end, many people post their
words along with their method of creation to usenet newsgroups such as
alt.magick.chaos and to chaos magick e-lists, from where they spread to
other sources.  If you are interested in having any words you create added
to the Ouranian Barbaric Dictionaries on the net, you are invited to
contact Fenwick Rysen (fenwick @ chaosmatrix . com), or Joseph Max.555
(maxx @ address . com) with your words, their method of creation, and any
other information you feel is relevant.  From there they will be
disseminated and incorporated into all currently updated copies of the
dictionary.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4   What does it mean to use Ouranian like "The Alphabet of Desire"?

The Alphabet of Desire was a concept created by Austin Osman Spare that
basically says to create a symbol set for your own personal use in magick.
It's creation, use, and application are incredibly personal, and
oftentimes hard to explain to others should such a task even be desirable.
Many people use Ouranian the same way, creating their own words, coming up
with their own rules for usage, and using it for their own specific tasks.
Those interested in Spare's Alphabet of Desire and basic philosophy should
read Spare's works, including "The Book of Pleasure" and "The Focus of
Life".  These can be found online at http://www.chaosmatrix.com/lib/chaos/

Stephen Mace's book "Stealing the Fire From Heaven" is the best guide to
creating an Alphabet-of-Desire in Spare's tradition that is available to
the modern chaos magician, at a very reasonable price.  Write to:
     Stephen Mace
     P.O. Box 256
     Milford, CT 06460
     U.S.A.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5   Are the words in Peter Carroll's "Masses of Chaos" Ouranian?

No, these words are Enochian.  For those new to either language, one would
be well advised to maintain a dictionary of both languages, and be careful
not to mistake one for the other.  Or, in the true vein of the chaos
magickal tradition, you could purposely interchange them and see what you
get.  Some people have worked with Enochian spirits using Ouranian
Barbaric, resulting in some Ouranian words for Enochian concepts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6   Are there other barbarous languages out there?

Enochian is another barbarous language, as well as an alphabet, used in the
magickal community, typically among ceremonial mages but oftentimes among
others.  Enochian is an "Angelic Language" that was channeled by Edward
Kelley and written down by John Dee during the Elizabethan era.  Enochian
is much more syntactically and grammatically complicated than Ouranian, an
each letter in an Enochian word represents a whole body of forces by
itself.  If barbarous languages are your thing, you'll LOVE Enochian.

Enochian is perhaps the most popular magickal barbarous language.  Those
interested in Enochian can find an incredible amount about it written on
the internet, and are also referred to "The Enochian Dictionary" by Laycock
(published by Samuel Weiser) and to "The Enochian Magick of Dr. John Dee"
by Geoffrey James (published by Llewellyn.)  A good beginning point on
the internet is at http://www.sonic.net/fenwick/enochian.html


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.7   What Ouranian resources are there on the net?

This is a list of known resources on Ouranian Barbaric or related files.
If you know of any more, please contact fenwick @ chaosmatrix.com for
addition to the next release of this FAQ.

Currently, the number of sites dedicated to Ouranian Barbaric is
diminishing.  It's down to Chaos Matrix with a few other scattered files
around the web:

http://www.chaosmatrix.com/lib/chaos/ob.html

Despite rumors over the last few years that other Ouranian Barbaric pages
are on their way, nothing has yet come to manifestation.  If this is no
longer correct, please send in the URL of any new pages for the next update
to the FAQ.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.8   Is there a gematria for Ouranian Barbaric?

No, and it is unlikely that an "official" OB gematria will ever be
proposed, in keeping with the individualist spirit of Chaos Magick.
Inidviduals are encouraged to create their own method for personal use if
they find gematria to be a useful tool in their magickal work.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.9   What is the relationship between Ouranian Barbaric and Psychic Censor?

The premise for the functioning of Ouranian Barbaric is that through using
words unfamiliar to your mind, you are better able to bypass the Psychic
Censor, and thus avoid Lust of Result and other psychological factors that
become involved when one performs magick.  This works well, but some have
discovered that it is of limited effectiveness, because if one works with
the language often he finds himself learning what all of the Ouranian
Barbaric words mean.  Tzimon Yliaster was the first to verbalize this:

     "There's a fundamental flaw to using Ouranian Barbaric as a technique
     over a protracted period.  After a time, it fails to do what it was
     created to do -- smuggle things past the psychic censor.  There's
     really no point to having another "magickal language", as it's
     language itself that arouses discursive function.  A seemingly random
     outburst would work better.  Words are still words, whatever language
     they happen to be in, and Ouranian Barbaric, once you know the meaning
     of the words, really isn't any different in that.  The advent of OB
     words like "Enochian angel", "kali" and even "Baphomet" should have be
     seen as a warning of this problem with it."

How one chooses to deal with this problem is of personal concern.  To avoid
this problem, it is recommended to refrain from memorizing the meaning of
Ouranian Barbaric words, similar in process to "forgetting" the meaning of
a sigil; this takes practice.

"Random Outburts" can also work well, and new experiments are being
conducted with Glossolalia as a magickal tool; Steve Wilson has covered the
topic best so far with his book "Chaos Ritual."

One could create new words for themselves when they discover they have
memorized the traditional OB words; this could be a burdensome process
however, possibly causing more confusion than it solves.  Some would argue
that this is a good thing, though.

Keep the Psychic Censor in mind when performing your Ouranian Barbaric
work; you don't want to make the language innefficient by memorizing as
much as possible of it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.10  Is there a Ouranian Barbaric alphabet with its own letters?

Ouranian Barbaric is most often written using the Latin alphabet for ease
of reading.  However, writing Ouranian Barbaric in its own alphabet can
serve further to distract the psychic censor from the concepts embodied
by the use of the language.  You could develop your own script, or use one
that has already been created.

"Ouranian Linear A" was first used by the people in the UK branch of the
IOT who were also responsible for originating Ouranian Barbaric.  It
consists of characters that all end with an arrow, which point you towards
the next character to be read.  This allows it the advantage of being
written in any direction: left, right, up, down, spirals, waves, etc.

Ouranian Linear A can be seen in the Barbarous Tongue Generation Rite,
mentioned earlier and available online at:
http://www.chaosmatrix.com/lib/chaos/rites/barbget.html
