<H1>An Essay on the Experience of Gnosis</H1>
<H2>by Wednesday</H2>

<HR>

(written mid-August, 1994)<P>

"we wanna be real, we wanna be pure, we don't want our vices and we
don't want the cure..." --leanne haze<P>

It's damn near sunrise and I should be sleeping, but the trend of
the past few nights has followed into this one as well, and I am
watching a thunderstorm wash away the night. The sky keeps flashing
a brilliant blue-white; if I looked outside and directly at the sky,
I would likely go blind from the light.<P>

I am tricking my body into gnosis-by-exhaustion. It works. Ever since
Sunday night, I've been 90% there at all times anyway. All it takes is
the slightest touch of something I love, and I'm back there. Music
(Leanne Haze, Petra, Boingo, Rush and Indigo Girls), dancing, food,
the steam of the shower, the wash of a mouthful of white wine. The walls
between myself and the ones I love fall that much more easily. Oh, yes,
suffer the witch, suffer ME...<P>

[I close my eyes, and in the flash of the thunderstorm I am back in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, walking past midnight on the fog-obscured campus
of Dalhousie University, green peasant dress blowing in the wind,
throwing my head back to the swirling white mists and howling in a
dancing twirl, chianti hair whipping around. I fall into the wet grass
and laugh. The walkman plays the ripping Rawlins Cross march I love;
for the life of me, I wonder if I took a walk down to the oceanside,
I would find the piper and be able to kiss him thank you for the
gift of the music....]<P>

I remember the connections, and have pulled them closer to me; I
harness the lightning and drink it -raw-. I am washed by cold water
and -feel- it -become- it -ride- it oh love oh god take me -BACK-...
I weep; there are no fields in the city of Chicago where I might
roll in wet grasses and laugh like a maniac...I yearn for Nutmeg.
Two weeks. Two weeks. Two weeks. A mantra, a solace, a comfort.
I smile at knowing that at least a few souls dear to me in many ways
will be there that I would share and it would make sense to them.<P>

Gnosis? Samadhi? Dhyana? Does it matter? It doesn't have a silly
formal name, whatever this is... love...union... I am the universe
and the elements and the vod, and none of that, and I am God and
God does not exist.... perhaps this is madness, remembering how to
kiss the water and embrace the flame.<P>

I'll drink deep, drink my fill, drink again and again and again the
octarine wine, full strength and distilled down, till I'm drunk with
the blood of the saints....<P>
