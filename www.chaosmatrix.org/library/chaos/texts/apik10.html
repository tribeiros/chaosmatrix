<H2>NEORMANTICS</H2>

<HR>
Neuromancy centres all occult ability and potentia within the
human brain - possibly the least understood and most complex system
of all. All occult exercises, according to this model, have some
kind of effect on the brain, and it also follows that in respect
to experiences with ASCs, possession, gnosis etc., that the root
event is occurring at a neurological level.<P>

Thus the aim of any psychotechnology is to unlock the powers of
the human brain. We believe that the evolutionary adaptation of
humanity is an ongoing development of consciousness, and the place
where all vectors meet in consciousness is expressed, in physical
form, as the individual biosystem.<P>

Of all the techniques of neuromancy, recourse to Chemognosis (drugs)
is the most widespread across cultures, and in the western hemisphere
particularly, one that arouses much controversy. Only those who
have received medical training, and can hence say from a position
of authority that they do not know how the brain works, are allowed
to tamper with it - through ECT, surgery and the good old 'chemical
cosh.' While it is fine for these watchdogs to impose their will
upon the brains of others, it is quite another matter for non-qualified
people to try it on themselves. <BR>
