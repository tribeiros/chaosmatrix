<H1>King of the Castle</H1>
<H2>Magical Order and Internal Schisms</H2>
<H3>By Phil Hine</H3>

<P><HR><P>

Anyone who has examined the history of occult movements in any
detail will realise that schism, disorder, and "magical differences"
are a regular occurrence. This is a fact much lamented by contemporary
magicians, and there is much wonderment that it continues in the
current occult milieu. In examining the development of magical
orders as form of social organization, it is necessary to examine
some of the predisposing factors which tend to make internal problems
almost inevitable.<P>

The roots of the modern occult movement lie in the Nineteenth
Century, and it is unsurprising therefore, that some contemporary
magical orders style themselves according the "traditional" patterns
established. Magical Orders such as the Hermetic Order of the
Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templis Orientis, owed much in their
organizational dynamic to Freemasonry. The Golden Dawn, in particular,
seems to have set the template for many magical orders thereafter.
The key element which should be understood, is not particularly
that the Golden Dawn was hierarchical, but that the hierarchical
grades came to reflect a kind of "spiritual" authority. The problem
with "spiritual" authority is that it is rarely open to close
inspection by others, and it is fairly easy for a charismatic
and forceful person to claim moral superiority to others on the
basis of a "higher initiation"  which is not, a priori,
open to inspection. Such was the position of Magregor Mathers
and other leaders in the Golden Dawn, and many of its imitators
since. Anyone may make the claim that due to a divine illumination,
they have a mandate to lead and inform others (I see a good few
letter making such a claim every month), but of course not everyone
is in a position to carry it across in a group. The magical order,
of course, is often the ideal place to make such a claim and make
it stick, and so a good number of would-be gurus and magi have
managed to fool at least some people, for quite a long period
of time.<P>

The problem with having, as it were, "God on your side",
is that it tends to inspire the leader with a tendency towards
absolutism. Paranoia is an inevitable consequence, probably due
to the feeling that anyone who dares to criticise is also calling
into question the very authenticity of the leader's initiation,
and therefore, authority. This tends to lead to a direct polarisation
of group members into followers and "enemies" - who
are not merely challenging the leadership but the entire Order
itself.<P>

The cracks in the facade appear by a process of dissonance - occultists
participating in a shared belief-system tend to a consensus on
what kind of behaviour is consonant with a particular "spiritual"
grade. When the leader begins to exhibit behaviour that calls
into question his or her assumption of that grade, then the dissatisfaction
begins to build further. Thus the leader feels his authority and
authenticity are being further challenged, and sooner or later,
it will all end in tears.<P>

Internal schism within an order is, in a way, self-regulating,
in that it makes a further polarisation between "followers" and
"enemies". Having a group of ex-members that the order can categorise
now as "enemies" tends to bond the members together, again, using
the glue of mutual paranoia and ruffled feathers. The next course
of action is all too familiar: psychic attack, magical battles,
sniping through the pages of the occult press and so forth. If
the members feel that they have "Truth", "God",
or "The Great Work" on their side, then the perceived
enemies automatically become black magicians or satanists. Suddenly,
the threat of dealing with internal contradictions within the
group can be brushed aside as the membership roll their sleeves
up for the important task of defending Cosmic Truth against evil,
just in the same way that adroit politicians use wars to distract
the populace from trouble at home. Studies of groups such as religious
cults indicates that groups are remarkably resilient in upholding
their shared beliefs in the face of threats to their continued
existence.<P>

Since the Sixties, there has been a backlash against the spiritual
hierarchy model so favoured by some occult orders. This has led
to the proposal that hierarchies are in themselves flawed, and
that no leaders are required to manage a group. This view has
both strengths and weaknesses, but unfortunately it has received
little in the way of critical analysis, and has become a matter
of dogmatic belief in the same way that the above model has become
an entrenched feature of occult belief - which tends to devolve
into absolutes.<P>

While occultists have been apparently existing in a vacuum, the
borders of which have been defined by the limits of largely incoherent
theories parroted by successive authors - there has been a good
deal of research conducted into organizational dynamics, in everything
from small therapy groups to large corporations, the outcome of
which makes some interesting points about both hierarchies, and
leadership. The first point to make about hierarchies is that
for some tasks, they function very efficiently - more so that
systems where each person is assumed to have equal status. A rather
mundane example of this is the so-called &quot;Bystander Effect&quot;
- where a group of people will not initiate any action in a situation
until someone appears to take charge and organise the group into
performing tasks. This is particularly important when decisions
need to be taken and acted upon effectively. However, this does
not mean that a group which assumes a hierarchical organization
is therefore solely limited to behaving as a hierarchy. At other
times, members may behave and interact in quite different ways.
So hierarchy is a form of organization which a group may use appropriately
- although care is required.<P>

Similarly, the question of leadership is more complex than it
often appears. Modern texts on group dynamics refer to leadership
as a role. In so-called 'Consensus' groups, which outwardly at
least, have no leaders, there is no critical evaluation of how
the leadership role might appear. Often then, it is the case that
charismatic personalities become leaders, by virtue of their ability
to influence others, rather than being chosen on a rational basis.
It will be obvious to some people that leadership on the basis
of &quot;spiritual&quot; authority is not exactly desirable. Equally,
charismatic personalities, though they are perceived as being
effective leaders, have a tendency to regard the position as their
unalienable &quot;right&quot; - due to them having written x number
of books or appeared on television as a spokesperson for an unquantified
number of followers. The glamour of being perceived as a &quot;star&quot;
also tends to lead to the feeling of having an absolute right
to lead.<P>

A more effective way to handle the question of leadership is to
treat it as a role. If leadership is a role, then it becomes dependent
on a definition, based on what it actually entails, rather than
being the province of one particular individual, with no clear
definition. If the qualities of leadership are explored and defined
by the group, then two key points emerge. The first is that anyone
may aspire to take on the role of leader in the group - providing
they can demonstrate (or acquire) the necessary abilities. Secondly,
that whoever takes on the role of leader is accountable to the
other members of the organization. If a leaders' task is defined
and known, then it is far easier for others to call the leader
to account if he or she is not acting appropriately. Morever,
since the leader is as much responsible for the success of the
group as any other member, then it is less tempting for leaders
to place themselves 'above' others in the organization.<P>

This has been a hard lesson for some forms of organization to
learn. Absence of clear definition and reliance on absolutist
authority which cannot be questioned or criticized tends to lead
to systems collapsing. Occultists are particularly prey to problems
when attempting to maintain group cohesion as there is a tendency
to absolute stances which quickly become entrenched dogmas on
the basis of &quot;Truth&quot; - be it legitimised from a spiritual
or 'politically correct' standpoint. If &quot;Truth&quot; is treated
as a relative rather than an absolute, as in Hassan I Sabbah's
dictum &quot;Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted&quot;, then
the way can be cleared for the modelling of the magical organizations
of the next generation on the basis of rational procedures and
informed choices.<P>
