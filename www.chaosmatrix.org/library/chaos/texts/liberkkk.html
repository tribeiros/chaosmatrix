<h1>Liber KKK</h1>
by Peter J. Carroll

<h2>KAOS KERAUNOS KYBERNETOS</h2>
(THE CHAOS THUNDERBOLT STEERS ALL THINGS)


<hr>

Liber KKK is the first, complete, systematic magical training programme for
some centuries. It is a definitive replacement for the Sacred Magic of
Abramelin the Mage, which system has become obsolete due to its
monotheist transcendentalism and its dependency on repressive forms of
inhibitory gnosis now considered inappropriate.<p>

Liber KKK is presented as a series of general magical techniques which the
magician must develop into a workable programme using whatever symbols,
instruments and forms of gnosis that appeal to him. It would be
inappropriate for a Chaos Magic text to prescribe any particular beliefs or
dogmas, except that magic works if certain general principles are followed. It
would be inappropriate for any Chaos magician to slavishly adhere to the
fine detail of any system. Much can be learnt from Liber KKK in the process
of adapting general procedures to personal taste and objectives. Liber KKK
may be attempted by any adult. The word "magician" applies equally to
either sex and the use of the male personal pronouns in the text is merely a
literary convention in the absence of neutral forms in English.<p>

Liber KKK is a series of twenty-five magical operations or "conjurations". The
five classical conjurations of Evocation, Divination, Enchantment, Invocation
and Illumination are each performed on the five levels of Sorcery, Shamanic
Magic, Ritual Magic, Astral Magic and High Magic. Thus the whole work
systematically resumes the entire tradition of magical technique, leading the
magician from simple practices and the manufacture of tools towards the
mastery of more complex experiments on the psychic level.<p>

It is highly desirable that the magician has some form of private
temple for his conjurations. Yet it is essential that the magician
remains active in the world for the period of the work as a whole. The
work does not entail any form of retreat from the world, but rather
the world surrounding the magician is used as the proving ground for
magic. Thus the business and social affairs of the magician are the
prime focus for his magic. In performing that magic he gradually
defines his style or spirituality. For it is senseless to define
spirituality as other than the way one lives. If the Way of Magic is
to have a spiritual component it can only be discovered through the
performance, all strictures and exhortations are useless.<p>

There is no upper limit on the time that may be alloted to complete the
entire work but it cannot be completed in less than a single year. Any person
with the time to complete the operation in less than a year should consider
adopting further worldly commitments as arbitrary goals in support of
which, various parts of the work can be used. Objective results are the proof
of magic, all else is mysticism.<p>

Samples of the Philosophers Stone which do not transmute lead to gold
will also fail as elixirs of enlightenment in a lifestyle of risk and
uncertainty. The magician may need to consider whether he needs to
adopt projects involving these elements before he begins the work. <p>

For the purpose of this operation, the five classical magical acts of
Evocation, Divination, Enchantment, Invocation and Illumination are
defined as follows:-<p>

<strong>EVOCATION:</strong><p>

Is work with entities which may be naturally occuring or manufactured.
They may be regarded as independent spirits, fragments or the magicians
subconscious, or the egregores of various species of life form, according to
taste and belief structure. In practice Evocation is usually performed for
Enchantment, in which the evoked entities are made to create effects on
behalf of the magician. Evoked entities also find some application in
Divination, when they are used to discover information for the magician.<p>

<strong>DIVINATION:</strong><p>

Includes all those practices in which the magician attempts to extend his
perception by magical means.<p>

<strong>ENCHANTMENT:</strong><p>

Includes all those practices in which the magician attempts to impose his will
on reality.<p>

<strong>INVOCATION:</strong><p>

Is the deliberate attunement of consciousness and the unconscious with
some archetypal or significant nexus of thought. The classical conceptions of
Pagan god forms are often used but other principles may serve. Invocation
creates states of inspiration or possession during which Enchantment,
Divination, or occasionally Evocation, can be performed.<p>

<strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong><p>

Is deliberate self modification by magic and may include spells of
Enchantment cast at oneself to repair weaknesses or increase strengths, and
Divination and Invocation performed for inspiration and direction.<p>

Thus all magical operations are based on the use of will, perception and
imagination, which is to say that they are all species of Enchantment or
Divination. Imagination is that which occurs when will and perception
stimulate each other.<p>

The five levels of magical activity, Socercery, Shamanic, Ritual, Astral and
High Magic are for the purposes of this operation defined as follows:-<p>

<b>SORCERY:</b><p>

Is simple magic which depends on the occult connections which exist
between physical phenomena. Sorcery is a mechanical art which does not
require the theory that connection exist between the mind of the operator
and the target. Any effects arising from such a connection can, however, be
regarded as an added bonus. Workng on the sorcery level the magician
creates artifacts, tools and instruments which interact magically with the
physical world and which can be used again in more subtle ways on the
other levels. The sorcery level work should be performed thoroughly, for
simple as its practices seem they are the foundation on which the higher
level work rests.<p>

<b>SHAMANIC MAGIC:</b><p>

Works on the level of trance, vision, imagination and dream. It opens the
magician's subconscious by negating the psychic censor with various
techniques. The magician faces considerable danger on this level and may
have frequent recourse to sorcery techniques or banishing ritual if it
threatens to obsess or overwhelm him.<p>

<b>RITUAL MAGIC:</b><p>

Combines the abilities developed on the Sorcery and Shamanic levels. The
magician brings together the use of tools from the Sorcery level with the
subconscious powers liberated on the Shamanic levels and combines their
use in a disciplined and controlled fashion.<p>

<b>ASTRAL MAGIC:</b><p>

Is performed by visualisation and altered states of consciousness or gnosis,
alone. Physical paraphernalia is not used although the tools and instruments
from the previous levels can be used in the form of visualised images. At
first the magician will probably require seclusion, silence, darkness and
considerable effort at concentration and trance to succeed with such magic,
but practice will allow it to be performed anywhere.<p>

<b>HIGH MAGIC: </b><p>

Is that which occurs when there is no impediment to the direct magical
effect of will, no barrier to direct clairvoyance and prescience, and no
seperation between the magician and any form of rapport or consciousness
he chooses to enter into. For most people the portals of High Magic are open
at a few peak moments in a lifetime. As the magician progresses through his
training the momentum he acquires will force open the gates to the
miraculous more often. No procedures are given here for the five
conjurations of High Magic. High Magic represents the point where technique
gives way to intuitive genius and each must intuit the key to unleashing
such powers for himself.<p>

The first twenty conjurations teach the full gamut of artificial tricks and
techniques for throwing and catching the magical thunderbolt. In High Magic
the primordial Chaos at the centre of our being grabs or hurls the
thunderbolt by itself.<p>

The five conjurations on each level may be attempted in any order but all
five should be completed before beginning on the next level. The magician
should prepare to begin the whole operation on a date that is auspicious or
personally significant. Perhaps a birthday or a seasonal turning point. A book
is prepared in which the magician is to record successes with each of the
twenty-five conjurations. Only successful results are noted and the magician
must modify his approach to each conjuration until results worthy of
recording are achieved. Lesser results may be recorded elsewhere for
reference. The record of the Liber KKK operation, however, should contain an
account of notable successes with each of the twenty-five conjurations. A
single success with each should be regarded as an absolute minimum whilst
five successes with each of the twenty-five conjurations can be regarded as
thorough work.<p>

With the possible exception of acts of High Magic, all conjurations should be
planned in detail beforehand. Upon entering the temple beginning work, the
magician should know precisely what he intends to do. Most magicians
prefer to write out a rubric for a conjuration even if they rarely use the
written form as a cue. The magician will often have to do more than is
planned as inspiration and necessity move him. Yet he should never fail to
carry out what he has planned or begin work with a vague idea of doing
some magic.<p>

<i>The Gnostic Banishing Ritual</i><p>

During the period of the performance of the Liber KKK operation the
magician may need to defend himself against the results of his own mistakes
and hostile psychic influences. He may also need to replenish his own health
and psychic forces. For these purposes the Gnostic Banishing Ritual may be
used. It is a technically compact and powerful conjuration of Ritual
Enchantment for all of the above purposes. It may be used freely during the
work as a whole and particularly as a prelude and an ending to each of the
first fifteen conjurations.<p>

Conjurations One to Five - Sorcery Level Magic<p>

Sorcery depends on exploiting psychic connection between the physical
phenomena and only secondarily on establishing psychic connections
between mind and physical phenomena. Each of the conjurations requires
the use of physical instruments which can be used again on other levels. It is
highly desirable that the magician make these instruments by his own hand.
However the magician may adapt existing objects for use if such objects are
especially significant, or unique artifacts, or designed by the magician, or if
such objects become available to the magician in an unusual or meaningful
manner. It is no accident that sorcery techniques often resemble certain
childhood behaviour patterns. Children often have a natural familiarity with
the simple principles of magic even if they lack the persistance or
encouragement to make them work. The adult magician is seeking to regain
that childlike sense of imagination, fluidity and wishful thinking, and turn it
into something of real power.<p>

Conjuration One - Sorcery Evocation<p>

The magician creates with his own hands a physical representation of a
fetish entity by carving, moulding or assembly. Its functions are in
general to attract success, to protect by repelling misfortune and to
act as a reservoir of power for the magician. It is usually shaped to
resemble some kind of actual living being or chimerical being whose
form suggests its function. If it is vaguely humanoid in shape it is
known as a Homunculus. It may be made to contain parts of the
magician's body or be annointed with blood or sexual fluids. The
magician treats the fetish as a living being, speaking his will to it,
commanding it to exert its its influence in his favour and carrying it
on his person when on critical errands. Some magicians prefer to make
two fetishes, one to implement will, the other to bring knowledge and
information.<p>

Conjuration Two - Sorcery Divination<p>

The magician prepares a simple model of the universe for use as a
divinatory tool. A set of Rune Sticks or Rune Stones is most excellent
for this purpose. Occidental geomancy sticks provide a somewhat
simpler model whilst the systems of Tarot or I Ching can prove too
complex for later work on the Shamanic levels unless abbreviated in
some way. The magician should perform divination both for general
trends and for answer to specific questions. The element of the
divinatory tool should be treated as having a fairly direct
relationship to the parts of reality they represent and the procedures
of sortiledge should be regarded as a mirror of the process by which
reality takes its decisions. Divinatory activity should be pitched at
a frequency and complexity which allows answers to be remembered. It
is preferable to divine for phenomena which are likely to confirm or
negate the divination within a relatively short time period.<p>

Conjuration Three - Sorcery Enchantment<p>

For the work of the third conjuration the magician may need to prepare or
acquire a variety of instruments, but chief amongst these should be a single
special tool or magical weapon, for enchantment. A small pointed wand or a
knife are especially convenient. This special instrument or weapon can also
be usefully employed to trace the pentagrams in the Gnostic Banishing
Ritual. A fist sized piece of modelling clay or other plastic material may be
the only other instrument required. To perform Sorcery Enchantment the
magician makes physical representations of his will and desire. Where
possible the magical weapon should be used to help make or manipulate
these representations. The magician should perform one or several
conjurations of this type per week. As always he should aim to influence
events before nature has made her mind up, and he should not put too great
a strain on nature by conjuring for highly improbable events.<p>

Conjuration Four - Sorcery Invocation<p>

The aim of the fourth conjuration is to create radical changes in behaviour
by temporarily altering the environment. There is no limit to the variation of
experience the magician may wish to arrange for himself. He might, for
example, after some careful background research, depart in disguise to some
strange place and play out a completely new social role. Alternatively, he
may wish to equip his temple and himself in such a way that he experiences
being an ancient Egyptian god for a time. In Sorcery Evocation the magician
tests to the limit his ability to create arbitrary change by modifying his
environment and his behaviour.<p>

Conjuration Five - Sorcery Illumination<p>

In works of Illumination the magician aims for self improvement in some
precisely defined and specific way. Grandiose plans for spiritual
enlightenment should be abandoned in favour of identifying and overcoming
the more obvious weaknesses and increasing existing strengths. For the work
of Illumination the magician makes or acquires some object to represent his
quest as a whole. This objects is technically known as a "lamp" although it
may take the form of anything from a ring to a mandala. The "lamp" is used
as a basis over which to proclaim various oaths and resolutions. Such oaths
and resolutions may also be marked onto the design of the lamp. The
magician may need to perform various supplementary acts of invocation,
enchantment, divination and even evocation to make progress with the work
of illumination. It is not unusual for the magician to destroy and rebuild the
lamp during the work of illumination.<p>

Conjurations Six to Ten - Shamanic Level Magic<p>

Shamanic Magic depends on the use of altered states of consciousness
in which active visualistation and passive vision seeking can most
easily occur.  The altered states which are easiest and safest to
access are those of half- sleep, dream and light trances brought on by
quiet meditation. However, any method of Gnosis can be used according
to taste, but in initial exercises it is wise to avoid certain
dangerous and ecstatic practices which can lead to a loss of control.
In general it is preferable to try and deepen the trance by
concentrating on visualisation and vision than to deepen it by extreme
Gnosis beforehand. In Shamanic Magic the magician is seeking to
discover and establish connections between his mental imagery and
phenomena in the world. Visions frequently occur in symbolic language,
thus for example, diseases take on the appearance of insects or
loathsome animals, and fears or desires may appear as spirits. The
magician or shaman should deal with such things as the images in which
they present themselves, banishing or invoking such forms by force of
visualisation and interpreting their physical meaning where necessary.
Shamanic magic tends to become a very idiosyncratic and free form
exercise in which the magician also explores his symbol synthesising
faculties.<p>

Conjuration Six - Shamanic Evocation<p>

In this work the magician strives to establish a vision of an entity which he
projects to do his bidding. It is often useful to work with the visualised
forms of the entities used for the sorcery evocation although other forms can
be chosen. In general, entities are used to encourage desired events to
materialise, or to seek out information, in situations which are too complex
for simple spells or divinations to be formulated. Entities act as semi-
intelligent spells with a limited degree of independent action. The magician
seeks to build an increasing rapport with the entities he has conjured by
imagination until they begin to have real effect upon the world. Some of the
best work with entities can often best be achieved by interacting with them
in dreams.<p>

Conjuration Seven - Shamanic Divination<p>

In Shamanic Magic divination consists of a vision quest for answers to
particular questions. However, the traditional term "vision quest" should be
understood to include a quest for an answer sensed in any way, be it
hallucinatory voices, tactile sensation or whatever. In general the magician
concentrates on the question he wishes to put as he enters his state of
dream, half-sleep or trance and then allows a flow of images, voices or other
sensations to arise within himself. A completely free form vision can be
attempted and later interpreted, or the magician may attempt to structure
his experience by looking for special symbols, particularly those chosen for
the sorcery divination work.<p>

Conjuration Eight - Shamanic Enchantment<p>

In Shamanic Enchantment the magician seeks to impress his will upon
the world by a direct or symbolic visualization of his desire. Thus
whilst in his chosen form of trance he summons up an image of the
target phenomena and visualises his desire coming to pass. The
magician will often find it helpful to visualise himself in the spirit
vision travelling to the person or situation he wishes to influence.
He then visualises an imaginative enactment during which the situation
or the person's behaviour changes to fit his desire. It is not unusual
for the visualisation to become somewhat symbolic or distorted or
coloured by the magician's imagination. In general these distractions
should be banished by greater concentration on the desired
visualisation. However, if they are persistent they may reveal some
knowledge about the target or the magician's relationship to it which
he can use to improve his enchantment. For example, if a target person
repeatedly appears to have some kind of aura or animal form in a
vision it is often best to work ones visualisation directly upon this.
Similarly, if a target situation seems to have some kind of
characteristic vibration or "feel" about it in the spirit vision then
the magician will often succeed by spirit vision then the magician
will often succeed by working his magic upon a visualisation of this
rather than of the actual substance of the situation.<p>

Conjuration Nine - Shamanic Invocation<p>

In Shamanic Invocation the magician draws knowledge and power from
Atavisms, normally animal atavisms. A number of ingenious explanations
exist as to why such experiences are possible. The human genetic code
contains a huge amount of apparently unused information. Much of this must
relate to our evolutionary history. The human brain has developed by a
process of accretion rather than by complete modification. The older parts of
our brain contain circuits and programs identical with those in other animals.
Some magicians consider that the psychic part of humans is built up from
the psychic debris of many past beings including animals, in much the same
way as the physical body is. Others consider that the collective psyches of
the various animal species is available to them telepathically.<p>

To perform Shamanic Invocation the magician strives from some kind of
possession by an animal atavism. The selection of a particular animal form is
a very person matter. It may be that the magician has had some affinity
with a particular animal since childhood, or has some characteristic, physical
or mental, which suggests an animal, or it may be that an intuition builds up
or that a sudden visionary revelation occurs. To develop the invocation the
magician should try to visualise himself in animal form whilst in trance and
even to project himself in astral travel as an animal. It is often useful to
physically act out the behaviour of the animal in a suitable environment.
With practice, varying degrees of split consciousness can be achieved in
which it is possible for the magician to interrogate his atavism upon matters
it understands and to ask it to provide him with such of its powers as his
physical or astral bodies can support.<p>

Conjuration Ten - Shamanic Illumination<p>

The so called medicine journey of Shamanic Illumination is a quest for
self-knowledge, self renewal or self improvement. It can take many
forms.  Traditionally it often takes the form of a death and rebirth
experience in which the magician visualises his own death and
dismemberment of his body followed by a rebuilding of his body and
"spirit" and a rebirth.  Sometimes this process is accompanied by
physical privations such as sleeplessness, fasting and pain to deepen
trance. Another method is to conduct a series of visionary journeys
summoning up the so called "spirits" of natural phenomena, animals,
plants and stones and asking them to yield knowledge. The simplest
method of all is to retire for some days to a wild and secluded place
far from the habitations of men and there to conduct a complete review
of one's life up to that point, and also of one's future
expectations.<p>

Conjurations Eleven to Fifteen - Ritual Magic<p>

In  ritual  magic,  the  physical  use  of  magical  instruments is
combined with altered states of consciousness in  a  series  of  structured
ceremonies.  You,  the  magician, also begin to incorporate certain magical
theories into the  design  of  your  work  to  make  it  more  precise  and
effective.  In particular, you should seek to broaden your use of trance by
using various techniques of gnosis. This has the  effect  of  bringing  the
unconscious parts of the mind, which actually do the magic, more fully into
play.  In  ritual  magic,  considerable  use  is made of various systems of
symbolic correspondence, analogical thinking, and sigils. These are used to
communicate with the unconscious and to preoccupy the conscious mind  while
magic is being worked.<p>
Ritual magic is always structured as an indirect approach to desire
on  the  conscious  level.  The  ritual  magician never works with a direct
representation or visualization of what he or she wants,  but  rather  with
some  sigil  or symbolic analogy which in a gnostic state stimulates actual
desire in the unconscious.<p>


Conjuration Eleven - Ritual Evocation<p>

For ritual evocation, magicians may choose to  continue  using  the
entity  forms  employed  in  the  sorcery or shamanic levels or may wish to
experiment with traditional forms from the classical grimoires of  spirits.
Alternatively  they  may  attempt  to  build  up  their  own  entity forms.
Tradition has it that a magician should not seek to maintain more than four
entities at the same time, and in practice this seems a good rule of thumb.
In ritual evocation a material basis is always used even if this is  merely
a graphic sigil on paper. In the initial evocations, the magician builds up
a  strong  visualized  image of the entity using full gnosis. In subsequent
evocations, you address various commands and  directions  to  the  material
basis  of  the  entity  or  else  seek  to receive information from it. The
material basis should be handled ritually and  while  in  a  gnostic  state
whenever possible. When not in use, it should be concealed.<p>


Conjuration Twelve - Ritual Divination<p>

In   ritual   divination   some  kind  of  physical  instrument  is
manipulated to give a symbolic or analogical answer while  in  a  state  of
gnosis.  Deep  states  of  gnosis  tend  to  preclude  the  use  of complex
divinatory instruments such as the Kabbala or  I  Ching  for  many  people.
Others may find that very simple systems such as bone casting tend to yield
too little information for this kind of work, while systems of intermediate
complexity  such  as  runes,  tarot  or  occidental geomancy are often most
useful. Before the divination, the  magician  should  ritually  charge  the
divinatory  instrument  with  a  sigil  or analogical representation of the
question.  The  divinatory  selection  is  then  made  under  gnosis.   The
interpretation  may  be  made  under  gnosis  also or on return to ordinary
consciousness.<p>


Conjuration Thirteen - Ritual Enchantment<p>

For ritual enchantment, the magician may well  choose  to  use  the
special  instrument  of  enchantment  from  the  sorcery level work, unless
particularly  inspired  to  create  a  better  tool.  The   instrument   of
enchantment  or  "magical  weapon"  is used to trace sigils in the air, and
also where possible in the manufacture and manipulation of various  spells.
All ritual enchantments depend upon the use of some kind of spell to occupy
and  bypass the conscious mind and bring the more powerful unconscious into
action. A spell can consist of virtually anything from the manufacture  and
consecration  of  a  sigil,  to the manipulation of wax images, or a ritual
enactment of some analogy of desire. In all cases, the  magician  must  use
gnosis  and  concentration upon the spell itself, rather than the desire it
represents to work effective enchantments.<p>


Conjuration Fourteen - Ritual Invocation<p>

In ritual invocation, you,  the  magician  seek  to  saturate  your
senses  with  experiences corresponding to, or symbolic of, some particular
quality you wish to invoke. Thus you may dress your temple and person  with
colors,  smells,  symbols,  numbers,  stones,  plants,  metals,  and sounds
corresponding to  that  which  is  to  be  invoked.  You  also  adapt  your
behaviour,  thoughts,  and  visualizations while in gnosis in an attempt to
become possessed by what you invoke. In practice, the  classical  god-forms
are  frequently  used  as the pagan pantheons offer a spectrum of qualities
resuming the whole of  psychology.  You  should  not  confine  yourself  to
invoking  only  those qualities for which you have a personal sympathy. Any
particularly successful invocation should be followed by an  invocation  of
quite  different qualities at some later time. A thorough program of ritual
invocation should encompass success with at least five completely different
invocations.<p>

Conjuration Fifteen - Ritual Illumination<p>

In Ritual Illumination the magician applies various ritual acts of divination,
enchantment, evocation and invocation to himself for self improvement. As
with all acts of illumination the changes attempted should be specific rather
than vague and general. The magician may find it useful to prepare a more
elaborate "lamp" perhaps in the form of a mandala representing his self or
soul for this conjuration. One effect of ritual illumination is often to force the
magician to choose between Atman and Anatta. If he works within the
paradigm of Anatta, the hypothesis of no-soul, then illumination is a matter
of the addition or the deletion of certain patterns of thought and behaviour.
If the magician works within the paradigm of Atman, the doctrine of
personal soul, or Holy Guardian Angel, then he faces a more complex,
dangerous and confusing situation. If a personal soul is presumed to exist
but without a true will then the atman magician can proceed as if he were an
Anattaist. If a true will is presumed to exist then the conjuration must be
directed towards its discovery and implementation. The author has avoided
treading too far along this path but has observed the process go
spectacularly wrong in numerous cases. Those who wish to attempt it are
counselled to avoid accepting as true will, anything which conflicts radically
with ordinary commonsense or "lower will", as it is disparity called in this
paradigm.<p>

Conjurations Sixteen to Twenty - Astral Magic<p>

Astral Magic is Ritual Magic performed entirely on the plane of visualisation
and imagination. Unlike Shamanic Magic where a fairly free form use of
images and visions is explored, this magic requires the precise and accurate
visualisation of an internal landscape. In this landscape the magician carries
out processes designed to bring him knowledge of the ordinary world or to
change the world or himself. Astral Magic has to be approached with at least
as much preparation and effort as it put into ritual magic or else it can tend
to become a brief series of excursions around the imagination to little
magical effect. Properly performed, it can be a source of extraordinary
power and it has the advantage of requiring no physical equipment. Astral
Magic is usually begun in some quiet secluded place whilst the magician is
comfortably seated or couched with closed eyes. There may be few outward
signs that anything is happening apart from perhaps a variation in breathing
rates or posture or facial expressions as the magician enters gnosis. <p>

To prepare for Astral Magic a temple or series of temples needs to be
erected on the plane of visualised imagination. Such temples can take any
convenient form although some magicians prefer to work with an exact
simulacrum of their physical temple. The astral temple is visualised in fine
detail and should contain all the equipment required for ritual or at least
cupboards where any required instruments can be found. Any objects
visualised into the temple shold always remain there for subsequent
inspection unless specifically dissolved or removed. The most important
object in the temple is the magician's image of himself working in it. At first
it may seem that he is merely manipulating a puppet of himself in the
temple but with persistence this should give way to a feeling of actually
being there.<p>

Before beginning Astral Magic proper, the required temple and instruments
together with an image of the magician moving about in it should be built up
by a repeated series of visualisations until all the details are perfect. Only
when this is complete should the magician begin to use the temple. Each
conjuration that is performed should be planned in advance with the same
attention to detail as in Ritual Magic. The various acts of astral evocation,
divination, enchantment, invocation and illumination take on a similar
general form to the acts of Ritual Magic which the magician adapts for astral
work.<p>

Conjurations Twenty One to Twenty Five - High Magic<p>

All the techniques of magic are really just so many ways of tricking some
indefinable parts of ourselves into performing magic. The universe is
basically a magical structure and we are all capable of magic. The really
useful theories of magic are those which explain why magic tends to work so
erratically and why we have such enormous inhibitions about believing in it,
making it work, and recognising that it has worked. It is as if the universe
has cast a spell upon us to convince us we are not magicians. However, this
spell is rather a playful cosmic joke. The universe challenges us to shatter
the illusion by leaving a few cracks in it.<p>

No details are presented for the five conjurations of High Magic, nor can they
be given, the reader is referred back to the remarks made on them in the
introduction. The magician must rely on the momentum of his work in
sorcery, shamanism, ritual and astral magics to carry him into the domain of
high magic where he evolves his own tricks and empty handed techniques
for spontaneously liberating the chaotic creativity within.<p>
