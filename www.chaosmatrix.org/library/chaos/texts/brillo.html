Ohhhh, I think I get it now.  I wonder if Occam was saying the same thing
I was saying, but in rather different words....<P>

I have noticed that most people cannot tell when they've crossed the line
from empirical data to speculation.<P>

Case in point:  Quite a number of years ago I had an experience that was
radically different from any I'd had before.  I was opening a can of
pickled radishes, and as the smell of the food came out, I had a vision.
Not external hallucinating, but something internal.  My consciousness
shifted radically and was a state I'd never experienced before.  In this
altered state I saw a plain, on a rainy, somewhat chilly day.  I somehow
knew it was in the first half of the 20th century.  I knew it was China.
There was a group of unhappy people huddled together.  There were guards
with guns gathered around.  Somehow I knew these people were Buddhists and
were being taken from their homes and rounded up, and were being punished
because of being Buddhist.  They were probably going be killed eventually.
There was a woman of indeterminate age in this group.  She was holding a
little girl of maybe five or six.  The little girl was crying - and
suddenly I knew that I was that little girl.<P>

Now, what all this has to do with Occam, I believe, is that Occam, like
me, understands that all I can legitimately say is what I said above.
That's all.  I can say that I had a subjective experience of such and such
content.<P>

But I told my new-age friends, and they got all excited.  "See, Laura!
You had a Past Life Experience!  That PROVES that reincarnation is a
reality!"<P>

They multiplied entities.  They crossed the line between empirical
experience and speculation, and they didn't realize they'd done it.  Occam
would say, if I'm not mistaken, that this speculation is not valid.  I
could speculate if I wanted to, and wonder if it was too many zen books
causing this vision, but I don't because I don't know.<P>

I would not tell a shrink about this, because the shrink would multlply
entities, too.  The shrink would say I was fucking nuts and send for the
men in white coats with the big butterfly nets.  That, too is
speculation.<P>

On another occasion I had a rip-snorter of an experience, complete with
white light and cool breeze.  Later some people said, "That was the Hand
of God touching you."<P>

No. No good.  We don't know that.  We don't know if God touched me, or if
I was momentarily psychotic, or if I was under too much stress, or ate too
much chocolate.  All I can say is that I had a subjective experience.  I
am the only one who can say it, BTW.  You can say that I REPORTED having
an experience - but you don't know if I'm telling the truth, or just
lying.  You cross the line into speculation when you believe me - or
disbelieve me, or make judgements about the experience.<P>

Not that I don't speculate, mind you.  But I try to be clear and aware of
what I am doing, and don't mistake speculation for facts.<P>

Are you there, JB?  Is this your understanding of Occam's Razor?<P>

Best regards,<P>
