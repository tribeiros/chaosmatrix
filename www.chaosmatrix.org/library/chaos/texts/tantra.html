That's how my fiancee and I first did some serious magick together.  I
found that the matching breath, accompanied by a very gentle swaying back
and forth (we were nude, sitting, facing each other, with our palms and
feet touching), and locking eyes spontaneously produced the effect of
body-switching, though I stress the effect, while very dramatic, was not
total.  This was probably made easier by the fact that she and I had both
had dreams where we were someone of the other sex.<P>

While it was not intercourse, and the contact we had was technically
nonsexual, we both later admitted it had been a HUGE turn-on.  I suffered
waves of pleasure, quite orgasmic, a bit like a hashish trip.  I don't
recall that we had a magickal "goal" in mind other than to experiment.<P>

Neither of us was on drugs at the time.<P>

I can only imagine it would be astoundingly intense if it were enhanced
by an entheogen such as LSD, though a very high dose of hallucinogen
might impair the concentration required.<P>

All in all, most worthwhile, and I recommend it, if you can find a
suitable partner.  This way lie other tantric practices, which I hope to
add to my magickal armamentarium.<P>
