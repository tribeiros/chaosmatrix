I think I make a crappy "I wanna be a black-magick-A.C.-amoral-psychopath"
sort of chaos mage, but am willing to learn. Please post pertinent
instructions.<P>
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

1. Examine your wardrobe. Any article ov clothing coloured anything
other than black must be discarded immediately, if not sooner.<P>

2. Locate the trendiest coffeshop in town. Go there, but complain
bitterly about everything and everyone nearby. Reminisce about
how much cooler it was before. (Before what is up to you).
Drink espresso and smoke clove cigarettes, or handrolled Drums.<P>

3. Purchase - or better yet, steal from the library, if possible -
everything by Uncle Al. DO NOT under any circumstances
actually read this material! You may, however, flip through it
now & then, to glean certain catch phrases with which to
pepper your complaints about the coffeehouse.<P>

4. Purge your music collection ov everything except death metal/
noise (choose one or both). Vinyl by Ozzy's Black Sabbath is ok.<P>

5. Learn the name ov at least one lesser-known Elder God. Paint
this on your leather. Sneer condescendingly at anyone who asks
what it means, or tries to pronounce it.<P>

6. Change your last name to a 3-digit number or the obscure Elder
God mentioned above. Sorry, SatanX7 is already taken.<P>

7. Familiarize yourself with the local magickal, pagan, or Wiccan
organizations or bookstores. (if none nearby, pick crystal worshippers,
believers-in-angels-in-UFOs or tree-huggers). Learn their basic beliefs.
Pooh-pooh them loudly in public.<P>

8. If anyone asks what exactly _you_ believe or practice, raise one
eyebrow (tweezed into devilish points for effect), stroke your goatee
(likewise), snort, scoff, and Cast Aspersions Upon Them.<P>

9. Post constantly to alt.religion.wicca, alt.gothic, or rec.music.industrial,
flaming everyone who has ever heard ov said newsgroup. Use as many
scatological and sexual terms as possible. Invent impossible physical
recreations involving rodents and dental floss and accuse them ov it.
Do Not respond to anyone who flames back - disappear for a day
or two, then start over.<P>

Bonus Points: never, ever, spell a common 2-letter preposition "o - f" ;)<P>

hey, it's worked great for me so far!<P>
