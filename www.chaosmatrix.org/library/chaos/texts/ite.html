Catholic term for the sin of most heretic groups who attempt to either
create
heaven of hell in this world instead of waiting for it in the next.  The
Gnostics are a prime example of people guilty of attempting to Immanetize
the
Eschaton.  Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea give a pretty good run down
of
the idea in Illuminatus! where Goodman and his partner are having the
phone
conversation with the priest.  The priest runs through some of the
Catholic
Dogma on the topic.<P>

I have seen the phrase used in an anti-heretical paper.  My head about
exploded when I read it; I had been thinking it was original to RAW.
Nothing new under the sun, of course.  I think the charge was levelled
against Martin Buber where I read it, but honestly my memory is faulty on
this point, except that I am very certain that it appears to be a
theological term, specifically a heresy, that predates RAW significantly.<P>

A little note on this oft-misunderstood phrase:  many people confuse it
with the idea of "imm*i*nentizing" the eschaton.  Imminent means "real
soon".  Immanent means "everywhere" or "all-permeating", perhaps.  The
eschaton, as every good Chaote knows, is the End of Everything.
"Immanentizing the eschaton" refers to the heretical idea that the
eschaton is in fact a state of being, accessible at any time, rather than
some chronological event.  Of course, in the theological usage, it
doesn't normally refer to magickal efforts to make apocalypse happen, as
the Chaote's looser usage usually means.<P>

Hope this helps, as they say.<P>
