KANSAS CITY, Mo. (August 2, 1997 11:45 p.m.
EDT) -- William S. Burroughs, the stone-faced
godfather of the "Beat generation" whose
experimental novel "Naked Lunch" unleashed an
underground world that defied narration, died
Saturday. He was 83.<P>

Burroughs died at 6:50 p.m. in Lawrence, Kan., at
Lawrence Memorial Hospital, about 24 hours after
suffering a heart attack, said Ira Silverberg, his
longtime New York publicist.<P>

"The passing of William Burroughs leaves us with
few great American writers. His presence in the
American literary landscape was unparalleled,"
Silverberg said.<P>
