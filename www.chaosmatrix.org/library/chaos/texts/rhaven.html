<H1>Rhaven's Alphabet</H1>

<P>The following is a copy of the alphabet created by Rhaven from the
zee-list for his own use in magick.  He asked that I scan it and
place it online for him.  Included is the letter he sent to me
regarding its creation, symbolism, and use, and the graphics of
the alphabet and the sigil wheel that were included with the
letter.</P>

<H3>Letter from Rhaven</H3>

<P>Fenwick,</P>

<P>Well, it took me a damn while but I finally got it off.  This is
the sigil wheel I wanted you to scan for me, I hope you don't
mind but I wanted to get a pic of my alpha too so I dropped it
in there.  Either one or both of the circles scanned will do,
and of course you're free to use these personally, or distribute
them, or turn it all into a nifty word game for your grandma.</P>

<P>There's only a little symbolism I kept in mind while making; I'm
heavily attached to symbolism and planetary/elemental forces, and
the 26 letters of our alpha broke down perfectly... five on the
inner circle for vowels and the four elements plus spirit, nine on
the middle for sun moon mercury venus mars saturn neptune uranus,
and twelve on the outer for the astrological houses aries thru
pisces.  I left the center openon this particular version, you can
put anything that pleases one there with a little immagination and
a copier.  The symbolism is a bit academic but I mostly watned
something that was universal somehow, and it jsut kind of all came
out anyway... primarily I wanted any damn system that I didn't have
to translate multiple letters into one or one into multiples, or
substitute vowels that don't exist.  I haven't seen any of these
other than the "Hermetic Rosy Cross" or whatever, it's in D.M.
Kraig's Modern Magick, and of course the old square system for
sigils.</P>

<P>My alpha is a bit complex for common use but it's good for
talismans and inscriptions.  Hope you get something you like out
of all this.  Drop me an e-mail if you have any questions.  I
really appreciate your trouble, thanks again.</P>
