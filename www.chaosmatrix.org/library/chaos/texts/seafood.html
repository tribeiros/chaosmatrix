Hi Zs,<P>

        I recently went to Captain D's (you know 'The Great Little Seafood
Place').  I placed my order and the total came to $6.66 (I'm not kidding),
and when I drove to the window there was this old bald man named 'Al' giving
me my food.  I'm not kidding about this.  It felt very strange.  Could old
Aleister be alive and working at Captain D's in Valley, Alabama?  I said "Do
what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law",  he just looked at me
strangely and gave me my change.  I went home and ate my fish.<P>
