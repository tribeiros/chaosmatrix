Ooooh..just outta curiosity (and the overwhelming desire to start a heated
debate on my favorite list), what is the difference between NewAgers and
normal freaks like us?!  I mean, where is the line that turns someone from
a pagan (or whatever title) to a NewAger?
</BLOCKQUOTE></I><P>

Oh, i've played the "lurking newbie" long enough.  This is one i feel
compelled to comment on.<P>

I'm loath to try to offer any absolute definitions (no offense, but these
arguments on "denotative issues" don't really thrill me), but i would like
to offer a few distinctions i've discovered between New Age-ism (NA) and
Chaos Magick (CM).<P>

For one, most NAers subscribe to an "absolute" theory of meta-reality,
particularly in regards to reincarnation and past-lives.  They tend to see
this system of repeating lives as premiere, the centerpiece of all their
other beliefs.  Indeed, i once had a NAer tell me, after i indulged his
wishes to do a numerology chart on me, that ALL numerology and astrology
was founded on reincarnation...  that without a foundation of the
'absoluteness' of reincarnation, numerology and astrology "made no sense
at all."  As i'm still sceptical on the notion of reincarnation, i've
foreverafter had a bad taste in my mouth about these two sister-systems
(just as well, considering how they tend to degenerate into fatalism and
determinism).<P>

NAers tend to see their particular system as universal:  "Everybody has
seven chakras, whether they know it or not."  "Everyone is reincarnated,
whether they know it or not."  "Everyone is subject to karma, whether they
know it or not."  They've even tried to assimilate all the other "big
name" prophets of all the major religions.  "Oh, Jesus was a mystic
proponent of reincarnation...  Really!  But it all got editted out of the
Gospels by various unenlightened sods, after the fact."  This has actually
been a strong selling point to NA dogma, that it can absorb other
doctrines, keep what they can use, and dismiss what doesn't fit as a
'pollution' to the original espoused belief, regardless of whether they
have any historical evidence to back it up.  But this also fosters a
blithe arragance towards "traditionalists," who just aren't 'cool' enough
to 'see the whole picture.' To paraphrase Yabro's "Messages From Micheal,"
"A plant needn't understand photosynthesis to turn green in the spring."
That pretty much sums up the NA attitude, in a nutshell.  Which, if i'm
not mistaken, elevates it to the level of "religion."<P>

CM, of course, doesn't promote any kind of absolute theory of the
afterlife, or any 'cosmic' code-of-conduct (karmic or otherwise).  This
alone draws a wide distinction between it and NA.<P>

Secondly, most of the popular mockery that the NAers have been subject to
is the caricature that they're basically "pollyannish," that they have a
skewed, unrealistic perception of the gritty "real world."  But i find
this image fairly accurate.  They don't really want to acknowledge the
ugliness and brutality of the world they find themselves in.  And their
strategies, their pastel-gilded "everything is love" attitude towards
every scenario, every situation, seems naive at best.  In a world where
rightist death squads kill school teachers in the middle of the night,
where transnational corporations irradiate our water table for the sake of
fiscal expediency, where one out of every five children are officially
malnourished and one out of every three women have been raped at least
once before their 18th birthday, the general attitude and strategies of
the NA community seem woefully ineffectual and outright ludicrous.  In
fact, it doesn't even LOOK like a strategy for change... its looks more
like a complex system of denial.<P>

This may be why so many NAers lapse into a state of paralysis and
impotence, having to rely on their divinatory tools, their rune stones or
their tarot cards, to make the simplest life decisions.  Or perhaps
they'll wind up meditating for 5 or 6 hours a day, every day... searching
for some revelation, some conceptual 'grail,' that will give their lives
some purpose, to fill some vacuum that they can't otherwise fill.  (This
doesn't look like 'results magick' to me.)  Rather than offering them
useful techniques to "take charge" of their own lives, it often winds up
offering them intoxicating avenues to help FLEE personal responsibility,
to avoid having to make the tough decisions that everyday life demands.
These are the fruits of the New Age, as i've seen them.<P>

Murray Bookchin, an eco-anarchist out of Vermont, once wrote of the NAers,
calling them 'lotus eaters,' comparing them to those characters that
Odysseus bumped into in Homer's "Odyssey;" an island of stagnant,
apathetic addicts, chewing on flowers all day, largely unaware of their
'outside' world.  Not an altogether inappropriate description.<P>

The CMs are (or seem to be) far more open to the full range of human
experience, good and bad.  They can see the world both for what it IS, and
what it COULD BE.  They don't rely on celestial determinism, and they
don't pretend things are prettier then they are.  In this regard, i'd say
that CM has a far more practical relationship to this "default reality"
then NA, and many other paradigms.  It offers a wider range of pragmatic
options for dealing with the genuine problems of our world.  It says, up
front, that an individual has to have the strength of will, the resolve,
to take command of their own lives, to steer the course of their own
personal evolution, regardless of how acary that might seem.  As opposed
to the NAers, the Chaotes don't shirk from the responsibility of
commanding their own destinies.  They welcome it, because they have the
vision to recognize this dizzying spectrum of options.  CM doesn't make a
very good 'escapist' paradigm... but NA seems pretty well suited to
escapism.<P>

The efficacy of NA as a magickal belief system is as potentially viable as
any other belief system, i suppose.  Why wouldn't it be?  And they use
several techniques that many chaotes have found value in.  (I, for one,
can still carry on a conversation with a 'lotus-eater,' and walk away with
some valuable insights.)  But frankly, the 'religious baggage' that tends
to come with a full-blown acceptence of the NA ideology seems no more
liberating (to me) than a full-blown acceptence of orthodox christianity.<P>

Or so i've seen.  Just an opinion.<P>
