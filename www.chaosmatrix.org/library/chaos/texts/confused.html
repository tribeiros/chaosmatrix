<H1>Fireclown's Sigilization Basics for the Confused</H1>
<H2>by Fireclown (monasteros@aol.com)</H2>

<P><HR><P>

OK, so you haven't read Liber Null, Practical Sigil Magick, the Grey Book,
Visual Magick, or anything else on Sigil Magick, and don't have any money
and/or hate books anyway. May this brief bit of fluff aid you in some way.<P>

<B>HISTORY</B><P>

Sigilization, or Sigil Magick is generally attributed to Austin
Osman Spare. I feel he got the idea from drawing up monograms as
a child, or perhaps from looking at watermarks on paper.<P>

<B>END OF HISTORY SECTION.</B><P>

<B>THEORY</B><P>

The general idea is that Magick functions on a subconcious/deep mind
level, and that the logical/discursive mind only hinders the manifestation
of results. It does this by 1) 'Lust of Result', and 2) constantly denying
the possibility of manifestation. I.E., 'I can't get laid 'cos I'm a
bastard!', or 'I'm stupid and clumsy and have no social graces, therefore
I can'e be a waiter, even though I really really want to be one". There
are other reasons, but I'm not going to go into them here.<P>

Therefore Sigil Magick seeks to implant and embed directions and/or
desires into the deep mind in a way that goes unoticed/unopposed by the
rational/discursive mind.<P>

<B>PRACTICE</B><P>

Take a statement of Desire, containing no negative words, and write
it out.<P>

I WANT TO FUCK BOOTSY COLLINS  (used as an example only)<P>

But no, that's not quite right...too vague...<P>

I WILL FUCK BOOTSY COLLINS<P>

Yes, thats better. Forcefull is good.<P>

Eliminate repeat letters.<P>

IWLFUCKBOTSYN <P>

Now make the letters into a monogram of sorts.<P>

			\  / | \  /
			 \/  |  \/      diagram simplified for ASCI
			    (|)
			___________


</PRE>

Anyway, you use all the letters left over and make a little picture.<P>

This is your 'seed', if you will.<P>

Now, forget all about Bootsy for awhile, and take you little picture and
PLANT IT!<P>

There are a variety of ways to do this, and we'll look at some.

<OL>

<LI>Gaze at the Sigil, whilst jerking off or fucking, it will embed when
you come.

<LI>Gaze at the Sigil, and hurt yourself.

<LI>Gaze at the Sigil, and hold your breath 'till you pass out. It embeds
when your head strikes the altar.

<LI>Strongly visualize killing someone you hate. Then visualize your Sigil

<LI>Strongly visualize making someone you love very happy, and visualize
your Sigil

<LI>Combine any or all of the above. The more contradictory, the better.

<LI>Meditate to vacuity, and when vacuous, visualize Sigil
</OL>

Obviously there are many ways to do this particular Magick Trick, just as
there are as many rabbits as there are hats to pull them from. The most
important bits to keep in mind are: make you Sigil nonrepresentative of
your desire, try to forget what the sigil is for, and I reccomend
deystroying your Sigil as soon as you plant it.<P>

I will also be heretical here, and say one should not record their
experiments with Sigil magick, and if they do, keep the records extremely
vague. One good way to do this is to seal the paper used to work up your
Sigil (perhaps the finished and charged sigil as well) in an envelope
marked only with the date performed. Don't open the envelopes for at least
six months. Still, I think that fast create/embed/destroy cycles work
best.<P>

Let me know of any questions, as well as fun or especially painful tales
that arise from these practices. These will be collected in a future
article, called 'Sigils as Harbingers of Personal Apocalypse' to be
assembled when enough tales of mindrending horror amass.<P>
