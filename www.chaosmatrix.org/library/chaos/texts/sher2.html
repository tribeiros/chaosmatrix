<H1>Chaos Magick</H1>

Chaos Magick has its roots in every occult tradition and in the
work of many individuals. If any one person can be said to have
been responsible, albeit unintentionally, for the present climate
of opinion that person would be Austin Osman Spare, whose magical
system was based entirely on his image of himself and upon an
egocentric model of the universe. He did not intend that the system
he devised for his own use should be used by others since it was
clear to him that no two individuals could benefit from the same
system. Nor did he fall into the trap of presuming that the information
revealed to or by him was pertinent to all mankind as all the
messiahs did. Aleister Crowley came to look upon him as a "black
brother" purely because he refused to accept Crowley's Law of
Thelema, preferring instead to work beyond dogmas and rules, relying
on intuition and information uprooted from the depths of self.<P>

The most recent public expression of Chaos Magick has been through
the work of the Illuminates of Thanateros, an order which Pete
Carroll and I initiated in 1978. Our aim at that time was to inspire
rather than lead magicians interested in the Chaos concept by
publishing ideas of a practical nature. Our approach differed
to Spare's only insamuch as we were interested in group as well
as solo magick. The response to our writings was much greater
than we anticipated and by 1982 there were groups working in England,
Australia, America, Egypt and Germany as well as allied groups
such as the "Circle of Chaos" and many individuals working alone.<P>

The difficulties of running such an order soon became apparent.
What seemed simple to us, both in concept and technique, was not
simple to people who had not suffered the bizarre and arbitary
intricacies of what is now referred to as "traditional magick."
This put us in an awkward position because it meant that a magical
concept which, by our own definition, could not be taught now
needed to be taught. Both Pete and I held guruship and hierarchy
as anathema yet now we were being expected not only to teach but
also to lead.<P>

It has been said that all systems of magick have the same end
result. I doubt that this is true because so many systems restrict
their practitioners within such narrow parameters of dogma and
morality (even if there is no priesthood as such) that instinct
and imagination are stifled by rules and doctrines. A path cannot
be chosen sensibly until all paths have been examined for comparison
and to restrict oneself to one path would, in any case, limit
ones experience and modes of thinking.<P>

A solution was eventually to the problem of how to reach that
which could not be taught. No rules or instructions were ever
given, only suggestions. No mention was made of notions best left
for the individual to decide such as reincarnation and the existence
or nature of god. Ideas of that nature have little bearing on
the performance of practical magick anyway, and individuals practising
the techniques rapidly came to their own conclusions. We knew
that we were on the right track when we came to collating the
information sent to us by individuals and groups. Without exception
everyone who sent results to us considered the techniques they
had used to be extremely potent but - and this was the important
thing - they had all come to different conclusions on matters
of philosophy. That they had come such varying conclusions and
still wanted to remain within the loose organisation structure
we had set up was more encouraging than anything else.<P>

To detail the methods of Chaos Magick would be spurious since
they are adequately dealt with in available publications. It would
be useful however, to point out a popular misconception which
has been unintentionally fostered by people writing in specialist
magazines. There has been some confusion about the word 'chaos',
some writers believing the word to have been used in this context
to express the techniques themselves. Nothing could be further
from the truth. Whilst it is correct that some modes of gnosis
are effective because they confuse the ratio-cinative functions
they ultimately lead to clarity and magicians involved in the
Chaos current tend to be meticulous in the way they organise their
programme of work. This is a legacy inherited from the "93 system".
We formulated the term "Chaos Magick" to indicate the randomness
of the universe and the individuals relationship with it. The
antithesis of chaos, cosmos, is the universe suitably defined
by the successful magician for his own purposes and that definition
is under constant scrutiny and may be regularly changed. Chaos
is expressive of this philosophy and reinforces the idea that
there is no permanent model for the individual's relationship
with everything that he is not. The word encompasses not only
those things we know to be true but also what we suspect may be
true as well as the world of impressions, paranoias and possibilities.<P>

If there were anything such as a Chaos Credo it would run on the
following lines: I do not believe in anything. I know what I know
(gnosis) and I postulate theories which may or may not enter my
system of adopted beliefs when those theories have been tested.
There are no gods or demons, except for those I have been conditioned
into acknowledging and those I have created for myself. I create
and destroy beliefs according to their usefulness. In the words
of the wise "nothing is true, everything is permitted"
- provided it interferes with no-one.<P>

At the group level obviously a consensus of some sort must be
reached. I use the word consensus advisedly because other descriptions
such as "shared reality" would be quite misleading since no notion
beyond the concrete can be shared. It can, at best, be appreciated.
Guidance in technique is always useful but reliance on books,
even books on Chaos Magick, is best kept to a minimum in favour
of working by instinct.<P>

Group workings usually fall into four categories - experimental,
initiatory, repeated ritual and celebratory (for which several
groups may come together) although by no means all groups include
all four categories in their repertoire. More important for a
group working any sort of magick is to build and maintain an atmosphere
which excites and inspires the imagination. The groups already
in existence have, to a large extent, moved away from the idea
prevailing in the seventies that theatrical trappings are not
necessary. They tend to use any device which will contribute to
the magical atmosphere they wish to create. The traditional magical
weapons are sometimes used but, more often than not, quite new
weapons peculiar to each group are made. Masks and robes are effective
and, therefore, widely used although nudity is not frowned upon
(See the "Cardinal Rites of Chaos").<P>

As far as experimental magick is concerned, sigilisation has been
the most widely researched subject, but telekinesis, ESP and telepathy
as well as many methods of raising power have been looked into
in varying degrees of detail.<P>

Chaos Magick is not looking for converts but anyone who is already
inclined towards magical adventure and who is prepared to break
new ground would be warmly accepted by the existing groups.<P>
