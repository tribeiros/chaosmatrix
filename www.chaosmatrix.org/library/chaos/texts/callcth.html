H.P. Lovecraft's Magick Realism</H1>

<H3>by Erik Davis</H3>

<p><HR><P>

<blockquote><i>In this book it is spoken of...Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres,
Planes and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial
whether they exist or not. By doing certain things certain results follow. </i><br>
--Aleister Crowley</blockquote><p>
<p>
	Consumed by cancer in 1937 at the age of 46, the last scion of a faded
aristocratic New England family, the horror writer Howard Phillips Lovecraft
left one of America's most curious literary legacies. The bulk of his short
stories appeared in <i>Weird Tales</i>, a pulp magazine devoted to the
supernatural. But within these modest confines, Lovecraft brought dark fantasy
screaming into the 20th century, taking the genre, almost literally, into a new
dimension.<p>
	Nowhere is this more evident than in the loosely linked cycle of stories known
as the Cthulhu Mythos. Named for a tentacled alien monster who waits dreaming
beneath the sea in the sunken city of R'lyeh, the Mythos encompasses the cosmic
career of a variety of gruesome extraterrestrial entities that include
Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, and the blind idiot god Azazoth, who sprawls at the
center of Ultimate Chaos, "encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and
amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demonic flute
held in nameless paws."<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a> Lurking on the
margins of our space-time continuum, this merry crew of Outer Gods and Great
Old Ones are now attempting to invade our world through science and dream and
horrid rites. <p>
	As a marginally popular writer working in the literary equivalent of the
gutter, Lovecraft received no serious attention during his lifetime. But while
most 1930s pulp fiction is nearly unreadable today, Lovecraft continues to
attract attention. In France and Japan, his tales of cosmic fungi, degenerate
cults and seriously bad dreams are recognized as works of bent genius, and the
celebrated French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari praise his
radical embrace of multiplicity in their magnum opus <i>A Thousand
Plateaus</i>.<sup>2</sup> On Anglo-American turf, a passionate cabal of critics
fill journals like <i>Lovecraft Studies</i> and <i>Crypt of Cthulhu</i> with
their almost talmudic research. Meanwhile both hacks and gifted disciples
continue to craft stories that elaborate the Cthulhu Mythos. There's even a
Lovecraft convention--the NecronomiCon, named for the most famous of his
forbidden grimoires. Like the gnostic science fiction writer Philip K. Dick,
H.P. Lovecraft is the epitome of a cult author.<p>
	  The word "fan" comes from <i>fanaticus</i>, an ancient term for a temple
devotee, and Lovecraft fans exhibit the unflagging devotion, fetishism and
sectarian debates that have characterized popular religious cults throughout
the ages. But Lovecraft's "cult" status has  a curiously literal dimension.
Many magicians and occultists have taken up his Mythos as source material for
their practice. Drawn from the darker regions of the esoteric
counterculture--Thelema and Satanism and Chaos magic--these Lovecraftian mages
actively seek to generate the terrifying and atavistic encounters that
Lovecraft's protagonists stumble into compulsively, blindly or against their
will.  <p>
	Secondary occult sources for Lovecraftian magic include three different "fake"
editions of the <i>Necronomicon</i>, a few rites included in Anton LaVey's
<i>The Satanic Rituals</i>, and a number of works by the loopy British
Thelemite Kenneth Grant. Besides Grant's Typhonian O.T.O. and the Temple of
Set's Order of the Trapezoid, magical sects that tap the Cthulhu current have
included the Esoteric Order of Dagon, the Bate Cabal, Michael Bertiaux's
Lovecraftian Coven, and a Starry Wisdom group in Florida, named after the
nineteenth-century sect featured in Lovecraft's "Haunter of the Dark." Solo
chaos mages fill out the ranks, cobbling together Lovecraftian arcana on the
Internet or freely sampling the Mythos in their chthonic, open-ended (anti-)
workings.<p>
	This phenomenon is made all the more intriguing by the fact that Lovecraft
himself was a "mechanistic materialist" philosophically opposed to spirituality
and magic of any kind. Accounting for this discrepancy is only one of many
curious problems raised by the apparent power of Lovecraftian magic. Why and
how do these pulp visions "work"? What constitutes the "authentic" occult? How
does magic relate to the tension between fact and fable? As I hope to show,
Lovecraftian magic is not a pop hallucination but an imaginative and coherent
"reading" set in motion by the dynamics of Lovecraft's own texts, a set  of
thematic, stylistic, and intertextual strategies which constitute what I call
Lovecraft's Magick Realism. <p>
	 Magical realism already denotes a strain of Latin American
fiction--exemplified by Borges, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Isabel Allende--in
which a fantastic dreamlike logic melds seamlessly and delightfully with the
rhythms of the everyday. Lovecraft's Magick Realism is far more dark and
convulsive, as ancient and amoral forces violently puncture the realistic
surface of his tales. Lovecraft constructs and then collapses a number of
intense polarities--between realism and fantasy, book and dream, reason and its
chaotic Other. By playing out these tensions in his writing, Lovecraft also
reflects the transformations that darkside occultism has undergone as it
confronts modernity in such forms as psychology, quantum physics, and the
existential groundlessness of being. And by embedding all this in an
intertextual Mythos of profound depth, he draws the reader into the chaos that
lies "between the worlds" of magick and reality.<p>
					<p>
<b>A Pulp Poe</b><p>
<b></b>	Written mostly in the 1920s and '30s, Lovecraft's work builds a
somewhat rickety bridge between the florid decadence of <i>fin de si`ecle</i>
fantasy and the more "rational" demands of the new century's science fiction.
His early writing is gaudy Gothic pastiche, but in his mature Chtulhu tales,
Lovecraft adopts a pseudodocumentary style that utilizes the language of
journalism, scholarship, and science to construct a realistic and measured
prose voice which then explodes into feverish, adjectival horror. Some find
Lovecraft's intensity atrocious--not everyone can enjoy a writer capable of
comparing a strange light to "a glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing
hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh."<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn1">[3]</a> 	<p>
	But in terms of horror, Lovecraft delivers. His protagonist is usually a
reclusive bookish type, a scholar or artist who is or is known to the
first-person narrator. Stumbling onto odd coincidences or beset with strange
dreams, his intellectual curiosity drives him to pore through forbidden books
or local folklore, his empirical turn of mind blinding him to the nightmarish
scenario that the reader can see slowly building up around him. When the Mythos
finally breaks through, it often shatters him, even though the invasion is
generally more cognitive than physical. <p>
	By endlessly playing out a shared collection of images and tropes, genres like
weird fiction also generate a collective resonance that can seem both
"archetypal" and cliched. Though Lovecraft broke with classic fantasy, he gave
his Mythos density and depth by building a shared world to house his disparate
tales. The Mythos stories all share a liminal map that weaves fictional places
like Arkham, Dunwich, and Miskatonic University into the New England landscape;
they also refer to a common body of entities and forbidden books. A relatively
common feature in fantasy fiction, these metafictional techniques create the
sense that Lovecraft's Mythos lies beyond each individual tales, hovering in a
dimension halfway between fantasy and the real. <p>
	Lovecraft did not just tell tales--he built a world. It's no accident that one
of the more successful role-playing games to follow in the heels of <i>Dungeons
&amp; Dragons</i>  takes place in "Lovecraft Country." Most role-playing
adventure games build their worlds inside highly codified "mythic" spaces of
the collective imagination (heroic fantasy, cyberpunk, vampire Paris, Arthur's
Britain). The game <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> takes place in Lovecraft's 1920s
America, where players become "investigators" who track down dark rumors or
heinous occult crimes that gradually open up the reality of the monsters.
<i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is an unusually dark game; the best investigators can do
is to retain sanity and stave off the monsters' eventual apocalyptic triumph.
In many ways <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> "works" because of the considerable density
of Lovecraft's original Mythos, a density which the game itself also
contributes to. <p>
	Lovecraft himself "collectivized" and deepened his Mythos by encouraging his
friends to write stories that take place within it. Writers like Clark Ashton
Smith, Robert Howard, and a young Robert Bloch complied. After Lovecraft's
death, August Derleth carried on this tradition with great devotion, and today,
dozens continue to write Lovecraftian tales. <p>
	With some notable exceptions, most of these writers mangle the Myth, often by
detailing horrors the master wisely left shrouded in ambiguous gloom.<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn2">[4]</a> The exact delineations of Lovecraft's
cosmic cast and timeline remain murky even after a great deal of close-reading
and cross-referencing. But in the hands of the Catholic Derleth, the
extraterrestrial Great Old Ones become elemental demons defeated by the "good"
Elder Gods. Forcing Lovecraft's cosmic and fundamentally amoral pantheon into a
traditional religious framework, Derleth committed an error at once imaginative
and interpretive. For despite the diabolical aura of his creatures, Lovecraft
generates much of his power by stepping beyond good and evil. <p>
<p>
<b>The Horror of Reason</b><p>
<b></b>	For the most part Lovecraft abandoned the supernatural and religious
underpinnings of the classic supernatural tale, turning instead looked towards
science to provide frameworks for horror. Calling Lovecraft the "Copernicus of
the horror tale," the fantasy writer Fritz Leiber Jr. wrote that Lovecraft was
the first fantasist who "firmly attached the emotion of spectral dread to such
concepts as outer space, the rim of the cosmos, alien beings, unsuspected
dimensions, and the conceivable universes lying outside our own spacetime
continuum."<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn3">[5]</a> As Lovecraft himself put it
in a letter, "The time has come when the normal revolt against time, space, and
matter must assume a form not overtly incompatible with what is known of
reality--when it must be gratified by images forming <i>supplements</i> rather
than <i>contradictions</i> of the visible and measurable universe."<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn4">[6]</a> <p>
	For Lovecraft, it is not the sleep of reason that breeds monsters, but reason
with its eyes agog. By fusing cutting-edge science with archaic material,
Lovecraft creates a twisted materialism in which scientific "progress" returns
us to the atavistic abyss, and hard-nosed research revives the factual basis of
forgotten and discarded myths. Hence Lovecraft's obsession with archeology; the
digs which unearth alien artifacts and bizarrely angled cities are
simultaneously historical and imaginal. In 1930 story "The Whisperer in
Darkness," Lovecraft identifies the planet Yuggoth (from which the fungoid
Mi-Go launch their clandestine invasions of Earth) with the newly-discovered
planet called Pluto. To the 1930 reader--probably the kind of person who would
thrill to popular accounts of C.W. Thompson's discovery of the ninth planet
that very year--this factual reference "opens up" Lovecraft's fiction into a
real world that is itself opening up to the limitless cosmos. <p>
	Lovecraft's most self-conscious, if somewhat strained, fusion of occult
folklore and weird science occurs in the 1932 story "The Dreams of the
Witch-House." The demonic characters that the folklorist Walter Gilman first
glimpses in his nightmares are stock ghoulies: the evil witch crone Keziah
Mason, her familiar spirit Brown Jenkin, and a "Black Man" who is perhaps
Lovecraft's most unambiguously Satanic figure. These figures eventually invade
the real space of Gilman's curiously angled room. But Gilman is also a student
of quantum physics, Riemann spaces and non-Euclidian mathematics, and his
dreams are almost psychedelic manifestations of his abstract knowledge. Within
these "abysses whose material and gravitational properties...he could not even
begin to explain," an "indescribably angled" realm of "titan prisms,
labyrinths, cube-and-plane clusters and quasi-buildings," Gilman keeps
encountering a small polyhedron and a mass of "prolately spheroidal bubbles."
By the end of the tale that he realizes that these are none other than Keziah
and her familiar spirit, classic demonic cliches translated into the most alien
dimension of speculative science: hyperspace. <p>
	These days, one finds the motif of hyperspace in science fiction, pop
cosmology, computer interface design, channelled UFO prophecies, and the
postmodern shamanism of today's high-octane psychedelic travellers--all
discourses that feed contemporary chaos magic. The term itself was probably
coined by the science fiction writer John W. Campbell Jr.in 1931, though its
origins as a concept lie in nineteenth-century mathematical explorations of the
fourth dimension. <p>
	In many ways, however, Lovecraft was the concept's first mythographer. From
the perspective of hyperspace, our normal, three-dimensional spaces are
exhausted and insufficient constructs. But our incapacity to vividly imagine
this new dimension in humanist terms creates a crisis of representation, a
crisis which for Lovecraft calls up our most ancient fears of the unknown. "All
the objects...were totally beyond description or even comprehension,"
Lovecraft writes of Gilman's seething nightmare before paradoxically proceeding
to describe these horrible objects. In his descriptions, Lovecraft emphasizes
the incommensurability of this space through almost non-sensical juxtapositions
like "obscene angles" or "wrong" geometry, a rhetorical technique that one
Chaos magician calls "Semiotic Angularity."<p>
	Lovecraft has a habit of labeling his horrors "indescribable," "nameless,
"unseen," "unutterable," "unknown" and "formless." Though superficially weak,
this move can also be seen a kind of macabre <i>via negativa</i>. Like the
apophatic oppositions of negative theologians like Pseudo-Dionysus or St. John
of the Cross, Lovecraft marks the limits of language, limits which
paradoxically point to the Beyond. For the mystics, this ultimate is the
ineffable One, Pseudo-Dionysus' "superluminous gloom" or the <i>Ain Soph</i> of
the Kabbalists. But there is no unity in Lovecraft's Beyond. It is the
omnivorous Outside, the screaming multiplicity of cosmic hyperspace opened up
by reason.<p>
	For Lovecraft, scientific materialism is the ultimate Faustian bargain, not
because it hands us Promethean technology (a man for the eighteenth century,
Lovecraft had no interest in gadgetry), but because it leads us beyond the
horizon of what our minds can withstand. "The most merciful thing in the world,
I think, is the inability of the mind to correlate all its contents," goes the
famous opening line of "Call of Cthulhu." By correlating those contexts,
empiricism opens up "terrifying vistas of reality"--what Lovecraft elsewhere
calls "the blind cosmos [that] grinds aimlessly on from nothing to something
and from something back to nothing again, neither heeding nor knowing the
wishes or existence of the minds that flicker for a second now and then in the
darkness". <p>
	Lovecraft gave this existentialist dread an imaginative voice, what he called
"cosmic alienage". For Fritz Leiber, the "monstrous nuclear chaos" of Azazoth,
Lovecraft's supreme entity, symbolizes "the purposeless, mindless, yet
all-powerful universe of materialistic belief." But this symbolism isn't the
whole story, for, as DMT voyagers know, hyperspace is haunted. The entities
that erupt from Lovecraft's inhuman realms seem to suggest that in a blind
mechanistic cosmos, the most alien thing is sentience itself. Peering outward
through the cracks of domesticated "human" consciousness, a compassionless
materialist like Lovecraft could only react with horror, for reason must cower
before the most raw and atavistic dream-dragons of the psyche. <p>
	Modern humans usually suppress, ignore or constrain these forces lurking in
our lizard brain. Mythically, these forces take the form of demons imprisoned
under the angelic yokes of altruism, morality, and intellect. Yet if one does
not believe in any ultimate universal purpose, then these primal forces are the
<i>most</i> attuned with the cosmos precisely <i>because</i> they are amoral
and inhuman. In "The Dunwich Horror", Henry Wheeler overhears a monstrous moan
from a diabolical rite and asks "from what unplumbed gulfs of extra-cosmic
consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those half-articular
thunder-croakings drawn?" The Outside is within. <p>
<p>
<b>Chaos Culture</b><p>
<b></b>	Lovecraft's fiction expresses a "future primitivism" that finds its
most intense esoteric expression in Chaos magic, an eclectic contemporary style
of darkside occultism that draws from Thelema, Satanism, Austin Osman Spare,
and Eastern metaphysics to construct a thoroughly postmodern magic.<p>
	For today's Chaos mages, there is no "tradition". The symbols and myths of
countless sects, orders, and faiths, are constructs, useful fictions, "games."
That magic works has nothing to do with its truth claims and everything to do
with the will and experience of the magician. Recognizing the distinct
possibility that we may be adrift in a meaningless mechanical cosmos within
which human will and imagination are vaguely comic flukes (the "cosmic
indifferentism" Lovecraft himself professed), the mage accepts his
groundlessness, embracing the chaotic self-creating void that is himself. <p>
	As we find with Lovecraft's fictional cults and grimoires, chaos magicians
refuse the hierarchical, symbolic and monotheist biases of traditional
esotericism. Like most Chaos magicians, the British occultist Peter Carroll
gravitates towards the Black, not because he desires a simple Satanic inversion
of Christianity but becuase he seeks the amoral and shamanic core of magical
experience--a core that Lovecraft conjures up with his orgies of drums,
guttural chants, and screeching horns. At the same time, Chaos mages like
Carroll also plumb the weird science of quantum physics, complexity theory and
electronic Prometheanism. Some darkside magicians become consumed by the
atavistic forces they unleash or addicted to the dark costume of the Satanic
anti-hero. But the most sophisticated adopt a balanced mode of gnostic
existentialism that calls all constructs into question while refusing the cold
comforts of skeptical reason or suicidal nihilism, a pragmatic and empirical
shamanism that resonates as much with Lovecraft's hard-headed materialism as
with his horrors.<p>
	 The first occultist to really engage these notions is Aleister Crowley, who
shattered the received vessels of occult tradition while creatively extending
the dark dream of magic into the twentieth century. With his outlandish image,
trickster texts, and his famous Law of Thelema ("Do what thou wilt shall be the
whole of the law"), Crowley called into question the esoteric certainties of
"true" revelation and lineage, and was the first magus to give occult
antinomionism a decidedly Nietzschean twist.<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn5">[7]</a> 	<p>
	Unfettered, this occult will to power can easily degenerate into a heartless
elitism, and the fascist and racist dimensions of both twentieth-century
occultism and Lovecraft himself should not be forgotten. But this
self-engendering will is more exuberantly expressed as a will to Art. In many
ways, the <i>fin de siecle</i> occultism that exploded during Crowley's time
was an essentially esthetic  esotericism. A good number of the
nineteenth-century magicians who inspire us today are the great poets,
painters, and writers of Symbolism and decadent Romanticism, many of them
dabblers or adepts in Satanism, Rosicrucianism, and hermetic societies. The
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was infused with artistic pretensions, and
Golden Dawn member and fantasy writer Arthur Machen was one of Lovecraft's
strongest influences.<p>
	But it was Austin Osman Spare who most decisively dissolved the boundary
between artistic and magical life. Though working independently of the
Surrealists, Spare also based his art on the dark and autonomous eruptions of
"subconscious" material, though in a more overtly theurgic context.<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn6">[8]</a> Today's Chaos magicians are heavily
influenced by Spare, and their Lovecraftian rites express this simultaneously
creative and nihilistic dissolution. And as postmodern spawn of role-playing
games, computers, and pop culture, they celebrate the fact that Lovecraft's
secrets are scraped from the barrel of pulp fiction.<p>
	<p>
<b>Proof in the Pudding</b><p>
<b></b>	 In a message cross-posted to the Internet newsgroups alt.necromicon
[<i>sic</i>]  and alt.satanism, Parker Ryan listed a wide variety of magical
techniques described by Lovecraft, including entheogens, glossalalia, and
shamanic drumming. Insisting that his post was "not a satirical article," Ryan
then described specific Lovecraftian rites he had developed, including this
"Rite of Cthulhu":<p>
<p>
	A) Chanting. The use of the "Cthulhu chant" to create a 	concentrative or
meditative state of consciousness that forms 	the basis of much later magickal
work.<p>
	B) Dream work. Specific techniques of controlled dreaming that 	are used to
establish contact with Cthulhu. <p>
	C) Abandonment. Specific techniques to free oneself from 	culturally
conditioned reality tunnels. <p>
Ryan goes on to say that he's experimented with most of his rites "with fairly
good success."<p>
	In coming to terms with the "real magic" embedded in Lovecraft, one quickly
encounters a fundamental irony: the cold skepticism of Lovecraft himself. In
his letters, Lovecraft poked fun at his own tales, claiming he wrote them for
cash and playfully naming his friends after his monsters. While such attitudes
in no way diminish the imaginative power of Lovecraft's tales--which, as
always, lie outside the control and intention of their author--they do pose a
problem for the working occultist seeking to establish Lovecraft's magical
authority. 	<p>
	The most obvious, and least interesting, answer is to find authentic magic in
Lovecraft's biography. Lovecraft's father was a traveling salesman who died in
a madhouse when Lovecraft was eight, and vague rumors that he was an initiate
in some Masonic order or other were exploited in the <i>Necronomicon</i>
cobbled together by George Hay, Colin Wilson, and Robert Turner. Others have
tried to track Lovecraft's occult know-how, especially his familiarity with
Aleister Crowley and the Golden Dawn. In an Internet document relating the
history of the "real" <i>Necronomicon</i>, Colin Low argues that Crowley
befriended Sonia Greene in New York a few years before the woman married
Lovecraft. As proof of Crowley's indirect influence on Lovecraft, Low sites
this intriguing passage from "The Call of Cthulhu":<p>
<p>
     "That cult would never die until the stars came right  again and<p>
      the secret priests would <p>
     take Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume <p>
     His rule of earth.  The time would be easy to know, for then <p>
     mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones;  free and <p>
     wild, and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown <p>
     aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. <p>
     Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new  ways  to <p>
     shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all earth <p>
     would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.<p>
	Low claims this passage is a mangled reflection of Crowley's teachings on the
new Aeon and the <i>The</i> <i>Book of the Law</i>. In an article in
<i>Societ&eacute;</i>, Robert North also states that Lovecraft referred to
"A.C." in a letter, and that Crowley was mentioned in Leonard Cline's <i>The
Dark Chamber</i>, a novel Lovecraft discussed in his <i>Supernatural Horror in
Literature</i>. <p>
	But so what? Lovecraft was a fanatical and imaginative reader, and many such
folks are drawn to the semiotic exotica of esoteric lore regardless of any
beliefs in or experiences of the paranormal. From <i>The Case of Charles Dexter
Ward</i> and elsewhere, it's clear that Lovecraft knew the basic outlines of
the occult. But these influences pale next to <i>Vathek</i>, Poe, or Lord
Dunsany.<p>
	Desperate to assimilate Lovecraft into a "tradition", some occultists enter
into dubious explanations of mystical influence by disincarnate beings. North
gives this Invisible College idea a shamanic twist, asserting that prehistoric
Atlantian tribes who survived the flood exercised telepathic influence on
people like John Dee, Blavatsky, and Lovecraft. But none of these Lovecraft
hierophants can match the delirious splendor of Kenneth Grant. In <i>The
Magical Revival</i>, Grant points out more curious similarities between
Lovecraft and Crowley: both refer to "Great Old Ones" and "Cold Wastes" (of
Kadath and Hadith, respectively); the entity "Yog-Sothoth" rhymes with
"Set-Thoth," and <i>Al Azif: The Book of the Arab</i>  resembles Crowley's
<i>Al vel Legis: The Book of the Law</i>.  In <i>Nightside of Eden</i>, Grant
maps Lovecraft's pantheon onto a darkside Tree of Life, comparing the mangled
"iridescent globes" that occasionally pop up in Lovecraft's tales with the
shattered <i>sefirot</i> known as the Qlipoth. Grant concludes that Lovecraft
had "direct and conscious experience of the inner planes,"<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn7">[9]</a> the same zones Crowley prowled, and that
Lovecraft "disguised" his occult experiences as fiction. <p>
	Like many latter-day Lovecraftians, Grant commits the error of literalizing a
purposefully nebulous myth. A subtler and more satisfying version of this
argument is the notion that Lovecraft had direct <i>unconscious</i> experiences
of the inner planes, experiences which his quotidian mind rejected but which
found their way into his writings nonetheless. For Lovecraft was blessed with a
vivid and nightmarish dream life, and drew the substance of a number of his
tales from beyond the wall of sleep. <p>
	In this sense Lovecraft's magickal authority is nothing more or less than the
authority of dream. But what kind of dream tales are these? A Freudian could
have a field day with Lovecraft's fecund, squishy sea monsters, and a Jungian
analyst might recognize the liniments of the proverbial shadow. But Lovecraft's
Shadow is so inky it swallows the standard archetypes of the collective
unconscious like a black hole. If we see the archetypal world not as a static
storehouse of timeless godforms but as a constantly mutating carnival of
figures, then the seething extraterrestrial monsters that Lovecraft glimpsed in
the chaos of hyperspace are not so much archaic figures of heredity than the
avatars of a new psychological and mythic aeon. At the very least, it would
seem that things are getting mighty out of hand beyond the magic circle of the
ordered daylight mind.  <p>
	In an intriguing Internet document devoted to the <i>Necronomicon</i>, Tyagi
Nagasiva places Lovecraft's potent dreamtales within the <i>terma</i> tradition
found in the Nyingma branch of Tibetan Buddhism<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn8">[10]</a>. <i>Termas</i> were "pre-mature" writings
hidden by Buddhist sages for centuries until the time was ripe, at which point
religious visionaries would divine their physical hiding places through omens
or dreams. But some <i>termas</i> were revealed entirely in dreams, often
couched in otherworldly Dakini scripts. An old Indian revisionary tactic (the
second-century Nagarjuna was said to have discovered his Mahayana masterpieces
in the serpent realm of the <i>nagas</i>), the <i>terma</i> game resolves the
religious problem of how to alter a tradition without disrupting traditional
authority. The famous <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> is a <i>terma</i>, and
so, perhaps, is the <i>Necronomicon</i>.<p>
	Of course, for Chaos magicians, reality can coherently present itself through
any number of self-sustaining but mutually contradictory symbolic paradigms (or
"reality tunnels," in Robert Anton Wilson's memorable phrase). Nothing is true
and everything is permitted. By emphasizing the self-fulfilling nature of all
reality claims, this postmodern perspective creatively erodes the distinction
between legitimate esoteric transmission and total fiction. <p>
	This bias toward the experimental is found in Anton LaVey's <i>Satanic
Rituals</i>, which includes the first overtly Lovecraftian rituals to see
print. In presenting "<i>Die Elektrischen Vorspiele</i>" (which LaVey based on
a Lovecraftian tale by Frank Belknap Long), the "Ceremony of the Angles," and
"The Call to Cthulhu" (the latter two penned by Michael Aquino), LaVey does
claim that Lovecraft "clearly...had been influenced by very real sources."<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn9">[11]</a> But in holding that Satanic magic allows
you to "objectively enter into a subjective state," LaVey more emphatically
emphasizes the ritual power of fantasy--a radical subjectivity which explains
his irreverence towards occult source material, whether Lovecraft or Masonry.
In naming his Order of the Trapezoid after the "Shining Trapezohedron" found in
Lovecraft's "The Haunter of the Dark"--a black, oddly-angled extraterrestrial
crystal used to communicate with the Old Ones--LaVey emphasized that fictions
can channel magical forces regardless of their historical authenticity. <p>
	In his two rituals, Michael Aquino expresses the subjective power of
"meaningless" language by creating a "Yuggothic" tongue similar to that heard
in Lovecraft's "The Dunwich Horror" and "The Whisperer in the Dark." Such
guttural utterances help to shut down the rational mind (try chanting "P'garn'h
v'glyzz" for a couple of hours), a notion elaborated by Kenneth Grant in his
notion of the Cult of Barbarous Names. After leaving the Church of Satan to
form the more serious Temple of Set in 1975, Aquino eventually reformed the
Order of the Trapezoid into the practical magic wing of the Setian philosophy.
For Stephen R. Flowers, current Grand Master of the order, the substance of
Lovecraftian magic is precisely an overwhelming subjectivity that flies in the
face of objective law. "The Old Ones are the objective manifestations...of the
subjective universe which is what is trying to 'break through' the merely
rational mind-set of modern humanity."<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn10">[12]</a>
For Flowers, such invocations are ultimately apocalyptic, hastening a
transition into a chaotic aeon in which the Old Ones reveal themselves as
future reflections of the Black Magician ("There are no more Nightmares for
us," he wrote me). <p>
	This desire to rebel against the tyranny of reason and its ordered objective
universe is one of the underlying goals of Chaos magic. Many would applaud the
sentiment expressed by Albert Wilmarth in Lovecraft's "The Whisperer in
Darkness": "To shake off the maddening and wearying limitations of time and
space and natural law--to be linked with the vast <i>outside</i>--to come close
to the nighted and abysmal secrets of the infinite and ultimate--surely such a
things was worth the risk of one's life, soul, and sanity!"<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn11">[13]</a><p>
	In his electronically circulated text "Kathulu Majik: Luvkrafting the Roles of
Modern Uccultizm," Tyagi Nagasiva writes that most Western magic is ossified
and dualistic, heavily weighted towards the forces of order, hierarchy,
moralizing, and structured language. "Without the destabilizing force of Kaos,
we would stagnate intellectually, psychologically and otherwise...Kathulu
provides a necessary instability to combat the stolid and fixed methods of the
structured 'Ordurs'...One may become balanced through exposure to Kathulu"
(Tyagi's "mis-spellings" show the influence of Genesis P. Orridge's Temple of
Psychick Youth). Haramullah criticizes black magicians who simply reverse
"Ordur" with "Kaos," rather than bringing this underlying polarity into balance
(a dualistic error he also finds in Lovecraft). Showing strong Taoist and
Buddhist influences, Haramullah calls instead for a "Midul Path" that magically
navigates between structure and disintegration, will and void. "The idea that
one may progress linearly along the MP [Midul Path] is mistaken. One becomes,
one does not progress. One attunes, one does not forge. One allows, one does
not make."<p>
	In the <i>Cincinatti Journal of Ceremonial Magic</i>, the anonymous author of
"Return of the Elder Gods" presents an evolutionary reason for Mythos magic.
The author accepts the scenario of an approaching world crisis brought on by
the invasion of the Elder Gods, Qlipothic transdimensional entities who ruled
protohumanity until they were banished by "the agent of the Intelligence," a
Promethean figure who set humanity on its current course of evolution. We
remain connected to these Elder Gods through the "Forgotten Ones," the
atavistic forces of hunger, sex ,and violence that linger in the subterranean
levels of our being. Only by magically "reabsorbing" the Forgotten Ones and
using the subsequent energy to bootstrap higher consciousness can we keep the
portal sealed against the return of the Elder Gods. Though Lovecraft's name is
never mentioned in the article, he is ever present, a skeptical materialist
dreaming the dragons awake.<p>
			<p>
<b>Writing the Dream...</b><p>
<b></b>	Within the Mythos tales, one finds two dimensions--the normal human
world and the infested Outside--and it's the ontological tension between them
that powers Lovecraft's magick realism. Though Cthulhu and friends have
material aspects, their reality is most horrible for what it says about the way
the universe <i>is</i>. As the Lovecraft scholar Joshi notes, Lovecraft's
narrators frequently go mad "not through any physical violence at the hands of
supernatural entities but through the mere <i>realization</i> of the the
existence of such a race of gods and beings." Faced with "realms whose mere
existence stuns the brain," they experience severe cognitive
dissonance--precisely the sorts of disorienting rupture sought by Chaos
magicians.<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn12">[14]</a> <p>
	The role-playing game <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> wonderfully expresses the
violence of this Lovecraftian paradigm shift. In adventure games like
<i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>, one of your character's most significant
measures is its hit points--a number which determines the amount of physical
punishment your character can take before it gets injured or dies. <i>Call of
Cthulhu </i>replaces this physical characteristic with the psychic category of
Sanity. Face-to-face encounters with Yog-Sothoth or the insects from Shaggai
knock points off your Sanity, but so does your discovery of more information
about the Mythos--the more you find out from books or starcharts, the more
likely you are to wind up in the Arkham Asylum. Magic also comes with an ironic
price, one that Lovecraftian magicians might well pay heed to. If you use any
of the binding spells from <i>De Vermis Mysteriis</i> or the <i>Pnakotic
Manuscripts</i>, you necessarily learn more about the Mythos and thereby lose
more sanity.<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn13">[15]</a><p>
	Lovecraft's scholarly heros also investigate the Mythos as much through
reading and thinking as through movements through physical space, and this
psychological exploration draws the mind of the reader directly into the loop.
Usually, readers suspect the dark truth of the Mythos while the narrator still
clings to a quotidian attitude--a technique that subtly forces the reader to
identify with the Outside rather than with the conventional worldview of the
protagonist. Magically, the blindness of Lovecraft's heroes corresponds to a
crucial element of occult theory developed by Austin Osman Spare: that magic
occurs over and against the conscious mind, that ordinary thinking must be
silenced, distracted, or thoroughly deranged for the chthonic will to express
itself.<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn14">[16]</a> <p>
	In order to invade our plane, Lovecraft's entities need a portal, an interface
between the worlds, and Lovecraft emphasizes two: books and dreams. In "Dreams
of the Witch-House," "The Shadow out of Time" and "The Shadow over Innsmouth,"
dreams infect their hosts with a virulence that resembles the more overt
psychic possessions that occur in "The Haunter in the Dark" and <i>The Case of
Charles Dexter Ward</i>. Like the monsters themselves, Lovecraft's dreams are
autonomous forces breaking through from Outside and engendering their own
reality. <p>
	But these dreams also conjure up a more literal "outside": the strange dream
life of Lovecraft himself, a life that (as the informed fan knows) directly
inspired some of the tales<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn15">[17]</a>. By seeding
his texts with his own nightmares, Lovecraft creates a autobiographical
homology between himself and his protagonists. The stories themselves start to
dream, which means that the reader too lies right in the path of the infection.
<p>
	Lovecraft reproduces himself in his tales in a number of ways--the
first-person protagonists reflect aspects of his own reclusive and bookish
lifestyle; the epistolary form of the "The Whisperer in Darkness" echoes his
own commitment to regular correspondence; character names are lifted from
friends; and the New England landscape is his own. This psychic self-reflection
partially explains why Lovecraft fans usually become fascinated with the man
himself, a gaunt and solitary recluse who socialized through the mail, yearned
for the eighteenth century, and adopted the crabby outlook and mannerisms of an
old man. Lovecraft's life, and certainly his voluminous personal
correspondence, form part of his myth.<p>
	Lovecraft thus solidifies his virtual reality by adding autobiographical
elements to his shared world of creatures, books and maps. He also constructs a
documentary texture by thickening his tales with manuscripts, newspaper
clippings, scholarly citations, diary entries, letters, and bibliographies that
list fake books alongside real classics. All this produces the sense that
"outside" each individual tale lies a meta-fictional world that hovers on the
edge of our own, a world that, like the monsters themselves, is constantly
trying to break through and actualize itself. And thanks to Mythos
storytellers, role-playing games, and dark-side magicians, it has. <p>
<p>
<b>...and Dreaming the Book</b><p>
<b></b>	In "The Shadow out of Time," Lovecraft makes explicit one of the
fantastic equations that drives his Magick Realism: the equivalence of dreams
and books.  For five years, the narrator, an economics professor named
Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, is taken over by a mysterious "secondary
personality." After recovering his original identity, Peaslee is beset by
powerful dreams in which he finds himself in a strange city, inhabiting a huge
tentacle-sprouting conical body, writing down the history of modern Western
world in a book. In the climax of the tale, Peaslee journeys to the Australian
desert to explore ancient ruins buried beneath the sands. There he discovers a
book written in English, in his own handwriting: the very same volume he had
produced inside his monstrous dream body.<p>
	Though we learn very little of their contents, Lovecraft's diabolical
grimoires are so infectious that even glancing at their ominous sigils proves
dangerous. As with their dreams, these texts obssess Lovecraft's bookish
protagonists to the point that the volumes, in Christopher Frayling's phrase,
"vampirize the reader." Their titles alone are magic spells, the hallucinatory
incantations of an eccentric antiquarian: the <i>Pnakotic Manuscripts</i>, the
<i>Ilarnet Papyri</i>, the <i>R'lyeh Text</i>, the <i>Seven Cryptical Books of
Hsan</i>. Lovecraft's friends contributed <i>De Vermis Mysteriis </i>and von
Junzt's <i>Unaussprechlichen Kulten</i>, and Lovecraft named the author of his
<i>Cultes Des Goules</i>, the Comte d'Erlette, after his young fan August
Derleth. Hovering over all these grim tomes is the "dreaded" and "forbidden"
<i>Necronomicon</i>, a book of blasphemous invocations to speed the return of
the Old Ones. Lovecraft's supreme intertextual fetish, the <i>Necronomicon</i>
stands as one of the few mythical books in literature that have absorbed so
much imaginative attention that they've entered published reality.	<p>
	If books owe their life not to their individual contents but to the larger
intertextual webwork of reference and citation within which they are woven,
than the dread <i>Necronomicon</i> clearly has a life of its own. Besides
literary studies, the <i>Necronomicon</i> has generated numerous
pseudo-scholarly analyses, including significant appendixes in the
<i>Encyclopedia Cthulhiana</i> and Lovecraft's own "History of the
<i>Necronomicon</i>." A number of FAQs can be found on the Internet, where a
mild flame war periodically erupts between magicians, horror fans, and
mythology experts over the reality of the book. The undead entity referred to
in the <i>Necronomicon</i>'s famous couplet--"That is not dead which can
eternal lie,/And with strange eons even death may die"--may be nothing more or
less than the the text itself, always lurking in the margins as we read the
real.<p>
	Lovecraft's brief "History" was apparently inspired by the first
<i>Necronomicon</i> hoax: a review of an edition of the dreaded tome submitted
to Massachusetts' <i>Branford Review</i> in 1934.<a
href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn16">[18]</a> Decades later, index cards for the book
started popping up in university library catalogs. <p>
	It's perhaps the principle expression of Lovecraft's Magick Realism that all
these ghostly references would finally manifest the book itself. In 1973, a
small-press edition of <i>Al Azif</i> (the <i>Necronomicon's</i> Arabic name)
appeared, consisting of eight pages of simulated Syrian script repeated 24
times. Four years later, the Satanists at New York's Magickal Childe published
a <i>Necronomicon</i> by Simon, a grab bag that contains far more Sumerian myth
than Lovecraft (though portions were "purposely left out" for the "safety of
the reader"). George Hay's <i>Necronomicon: The Book of Dead Names</i>, also a
child of the '70s, is the most complex, intriguing, and Lovecraftian of the
lot. In the spirit of the master's pseudoscholarship, Hay nests the fabulated
invocations of Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu amongst a set of analytic, literary and
historical essays.<p>
	Though magicians with strong imaginations have claimed that even the Simon
book works wonders, the pseudohistories of the various <i>Necronomicons </i>are
far more compelling than the texts themselves. Lovecraft himself provided the
bare bones: the text was penned in 730 A.D by a poet, the Mad Arab Abdul
Alhazred, and named after the nocturnal sounds of insects. It was subsequently
translated by Theodorus Philetas into Greek, by Olaus Wormius into Latin, and
by John Dee into English. Lovecraft lists various libraries and private
collections where fragments of the volume reside, and gives us a knowing wink
by noting that the fantasy writer R.W. Chambers is said to have derived the
monstrous and suppressed book found in his novel <i>The King in Yellow</i> from
rumors of the <i>Necronomicon</i> (Lovecraft himself claimed to have gotten his
inspiration from Chambers).	<p>
	All of the <i>Necronomicon's</i> subsequent pseudohistories weave the book in
and out of actual occult history, with John Dee playing a particularly
conspicuous role. According to Colin Wilson, the version of the text published
in the Hay <i>Necronomicon</i> was encrypted in Dee's Enochian cipher-text
<i>Liber Logoaeth</i> . Colin Low's <i>Necronomicon</i> FAQ claims that Dee
discovered the book at the court of King Rudolph II's court in Prague, and that
is was under its influence that Dee and his scryer Edward Kelly achieved their
most powerful astral encounters. Never published, Dee's translation became part
of celebrated collection of Elias Ashmole housed at the British Library. Here
Crowley read it, freely cobbling passages for <i>The Book of the Law</i>, and
ultimately passing on some of its contents indirectly to Lovecraft through
Sophia Greene. Crowley's role in Low's tale is appropriate, for Crowley
certainly knew the magical power of hoax and history.<p>
	For the history of the occult <i>is</i> a confabulation, its lies wedded to
its genealogies, its "timeless" truths fabricated by revisionists, madmen, and
geniuses, its esoteric traditions a constantly shifting conspiracy of
influences. The <i>Necronomicon</i> is not the first fiction to generate real
magical activity within this potent twilight zone between philology and
fantasy. <p>
	To take an example from an earlier era, the anonymous Rosicrucian manifestos
that first appeared in the early 1600s claimed to issue from a secret
brotherhood of Christian Hermeticists who finally deemed it time to come above
ground. Many readers immediately wanted to join up, though it is unlikely that
such a group existed at the time. But this hoax focused esoteric desire and
inspired an explosion of "real" Rosicrucian groups. Though one of the two
suspected authors of the manifestos, Johann Valentin Andreae, never came clean,
he made veiled references to Rosicrucianism as an "ingenius game which a masked
person might like to play upon the literary scene, especially in an age
infatuated with everything unusual."<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn17">[19]</a>
Like the Rosicrucian manifestos or Blavatsky's <i>Book of Dzyan</i>,
Lovecraft's <i>Necronomicon</i> is the occult equivalent of Orson Welles' radio
broadcast of the "War of the Worlds." As Lovecraft himself wrote, "No weird
story can truly produce terror unless it is devised with all the care and
verisimilitude of an actual hoax."<a href="lovecraft_fn.html#fn18">[20]</a><p>
	In <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i>, Umberto Eco suggests that esoteric truth is
perhaps nothing more than a semiotic conspiracy theory born of an endlessly
rehashed and self-referential literature--the intertextual fabric Lovecraft
understood so well. For those who need to ground their profound states of
consciousness in objective correlatives, this is a damning indictment of
"tradition." But as Chaos magicians remind us, magic is nothing more than
subjective experience interacting with an internally consistent matrix of signs
and affects. In the absence of orthodoxy, all we have is the dynamic tantra of
text and perception, of reading and dream. These days the Great Work may be
nothing more or less than this "ingenius game," fabricating itself without
closure or rest, weaving itself out of the resplendent void where Azazoth
writhes on his Mandelbrot throne.<p>
