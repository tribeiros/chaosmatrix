Introduction

  This is the second ezine produced by the members of the Z(Cluster), a non
  hierarchical international association of chaos magicians.  Chaos Magick is
  a postmodern variation on Ceremonial Magick first developed by Austin 
  Osman Spare in London at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.  Chaos 
  Magicians believe it to be the most appropriate magickal stance for con-
  temporary society and the new millenium.  A longer introduction to Chaos 
  Magick, for readers unfamiliar with it, may be found in the ZChronicles1.x.
  
  This issue of the ezine has contributions from 8 of the nodes of the Cluster,
  but members produce far more than can be found here, and interested readers 
  are directed to the websites on which many of the essays, rituals, FAQs, 
  and graphics reside. Truly interested readers are advised to join the 
  Z(Cluster) so that they can avail themselves of the words of the  many 
  members who did not contribute to this issue but are active online.
        
  Chaos Magick, unlike many other forms of Magick, has no secrets, except those
  secrets you hide from yourself.  Chaos Magick is as unique as the individual
  Chaos Magician, and the contents of this ezine reflect this individuality.
  
  Unlike ZChronicles1, which was conceived as an introduction to chaos magick 
  and to the Z(Cluster), ZChronicles2 is more practically oriented and contains
  a number of workings, rituals, rites, and exercises for the new or advanced 
  chaos magician.
  
  This ezine is a work in progress.  Over the next few months it will meta-
  morphose from an ascii document to a webzine.  Finally, it will be produced
  as a hard copy zine.  Hard copies of ZChronicles1 are still available for 
  $6 from marik@aol.com.
  
*******************************************************************************

Questions and Answers on the Z(Cluster)

1.  What is the Z(Cluster)?

a)The Z(Cluster) is an association of chaos  magicians
b)The Z(Cluster) is a chaos infection, spreading through the internet, 
  and lodging in the damaged neocorteces of chaos magicians foolish 
  enough to believe that magick can be performed through the recycled
  electrons of the world wide data web.
c)The Z(Cluster) is a group of IOT wannabees whose only purpose in life 
  is to whine about/wimpily attack the standup real chaos magicians of
  that venerable association.
d)The Z(Cluster) is a figment of the editor's imagination.
e)The Z(Cluster) is a figment of your imagination.  If you had not 
  committed the original sin of dualistic thinking you would realize 
  there is no such phenomenam as the Z(Cluster).
  
2.  Why should I join the Z(Cluster)?

a)I'm so confused by the answers to question 1 that the only way I can 
  expect to sleep tonight is by joining.
  
b)I like their style.

c)I hate the IOT, the OTO, the GD, and every other magickal organization
  I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.
  
c)I'm interested in chaos magick and would like to practice strange dark
  rites but am disturbed by those tentacles that tap at my window every time 
  I do a rite from Simon's Necronomicaon.
  
d)I got nothing to lose because the Z(Cluster), unlike every other group I
  have every encountered doesn't actually expect me to do squat.  
  
e)I'm real lazy but think that by becoming a member and hence a real chaote
  i will (i) get laid more often, (ii) not get beaten up quite so much, 
  (iii)will be reborn in a sexual paradise when I die.
  
f)I actually understand most of this shit they're trying to do and agree that
  civilization is a disease, that bringing about the destruction of the 
  consensual belief structure, and hence the end of the world, is a good thing. 
  

2.  O.K. I can say yes to one of the above.  How can I join?

Joining the Z(Cluster) requires a simple declaration.  Actually getting 
anything out of it requires telling marik@aol.com that you are a 
member.  Something along the lines of "I declare myself to be a member
of the Z(Cluster)."  It is customary for members to declarethemselves a node, 
and give themselves a node name containing the letter Z.  Some members refuse 
to do this.  Since there are no rules, ranks, leaders, dues, 
or any other requirements to associate with the Z(Cluster) members are governed 
by common courtesy, or whatever they deem to be such.  Since the Z(Cluster) 
is also a clearinghouse for chaos related messages, rituals, and documents, 
getting on the ZCluster mailing list ensures continuing information. To get on
the mailing list, send email to marik and he will tell you how.  It's pretty
simple.


3.  If I refuse to declare myself a member will I be able to participate
    in Z(Cluster) activities?
    	
a)Certainly
b)Absolutely not
c)Maybe
d)What do I know?

3.  Who belongs to the Z(Cluster)?

As of 3/15/96 there are 25 known nodes of the cluster.  Some of these
nodes contain 15 to 30 members, some 5 to 10, and most one or two.
Estimates on the actual membership range between 50 and 100.  
Some nodes appear to be inactive, some are working, some are hyperactive,
and some may have passed on to a higher state of human evolution and 
joined the Greys in their sadly misunderstood but brave war against 
the fascist Galactic Federation.(Waddyamean you don't think the Greys
should be abducting humans and subjecting them to proctological
examinations with gleaming steel probes? A number of our members have
been pleading with the greys for just this experience, but no luck so
far!)  Anyway, if you really want to know who belongs, declare yourself
a member to marik and he'll send you a list of members, their net addresses,
and even, from the really foolish, their home addresses and telephone
numbers.

4.  What does the Z(Cluster) have to offer?

A mailing list.  The occassional newsletter.  An ezine once or twice a 
year.  A MUD space in which online rituals can take place in real time. 
A hard copy zine of indeterminate frequency. Perhaps an IRC Undernet channel 
Soon, a website and a webzine. Mainly plenty of support from chaos magicians 
genuinely interested in sharing their knowledge, having fun, perfoming online 
rituals, and treating each other in a friendly, intelligent, and 
(given this document) surprisingly mature way.

With all that talk of servetor (how ever they are spelled) and 
godforms I was wondering how people here went about their ways of 
creating them seeing that most people have diffent ideas and 
meathods.

So how about so examples of perfered methods?

Ah, don't worry about the spelling.  I never encountered the word before I
met FireClown.  I think Peter Carroll made it up as part of his attempt to
obfuscate chaos magick.  Demons, imaginary friends, guardian angels, sprites,
elementals, fairies, and practically any other type of entity can be defined
as a servitor if it is bound by you and charged with a special function.
 Servitors can be considered bits of one's psyche that have been given a
certain amount of independence.  For example, FireClown has a bookfinding
servitor that brings him the books he seeks.  FireClown, being a bit
bibliophilic, always has a list of arcane and usually out of print books or
pamphlets he wants, but he is unwilling to spend every free minute wandering
through SF's billion used bookstores.  So he lets his servitor do it for him,
and the books appear.  Often a friend will say, weren't you looking for this
particular book?  etc...  FireClown will tell you, if you wish, how he
created this servitor.  William Blake had servitors that taught him painting
and also, by the looks of one of his illustrations, swept his floors.  How
good of a job his domestic servant servitor did is not recorded, to my
knowledge, but the one that taught him painting was certainly very talented
and did a fine job.  

I, and, I believe, FireClown, have a group of servitors who cluster around
us.  I can sense them, but I do not know their names.  I send them out to do
my bidding, and occassionally call them back.  These entities appear to be
both loyal and vicious. I usually charge them with jobs in Baphomet
ceremonies. Because I do not find Baphomet, sweet and hairy though he is, a
particularly wankable entity,I  do blood ceremonies.  Because I'm fairly
squeamish about bloodletting, I use a retrctable lancet thingie with sterile
needles to draw blood.  I then smear the blood either on a crystal I have or
on the image of the god himself.  I then order my servitors to perform their
deed and ask the God to keep and eye on them.  Sometimes, if I am harmed by
another person, the servitors appear to assume that I wish them to create
harm in return and I have had occassion where I have had to tell them not to
attack an attacker.  Sometimes I don't care.  The last person who stole
jewelry from me ( a lot, five years ago), was shot dead in a bar shortly
after the theft.  In this case I did not tell my demons to attack, but they
may have anyway.  I do not know.  It is sometimes helpful for me to think
that they did.  Because I am a black magician (interested in those areas of
my psyche that are hidden from me and frighten me), my servitors are demons.
But for many chaotes I think they are not.

I think that servitor development has something to do with childhood.  I
believe most of us developed servitors in childhood and that some of these
might still be hanging around in our psyches.  At least the means to develop
an imaginary entity that has a certain autonomy seems to be wired into the
imaginative faculties of most children.  Movies on this subject include Drop
Dead Fred, Toy Story, Tetsudo, and Natural Born Killers.  Books on this
subject are endless and include grimoires, children's stories, and any number
of fantasy mythologies.

Phil Hine deals with this topic at length, best in his pamphlet Condensed
Chaos,less well in his book Condensed Chaos. 

I don't personally do much sigil magick.  Mostly I work with unnamed
servitors, lucid dreaming, and godforms.  Lucid dreaming, BTW, is a fine way
to develop control over psychic entities, since in lucid dreaming it is
relatively easy to modify characteristics of the dream environment, including
the entities that populate the dream.

A pleasure to answer your question, Jim.  I would like to hear from others
since I will, within a couple of months, be writing the second part of my
bloody long essay on Sigils, Servitors, and Godforms.

In chaos,

marik

To me, the best descriptive name applied to what Carroll and many Chaotes 
call a servitor is "bud-will", although I also frequently call them 
"fetches" as well.  I see them as a disembodied attribute of desire; in 
other words, servitors are manufactured entities with a singular purpose 
to their existence.  One could also think of a servitor as the ghost of 
an obsession that has been exorcized from it's home and can return to it 
only when it has united itself with the object of it's desire.

Once created, I think servitors have a limited degree of free will - 
limited by the scope of the desire they have been created to achieve.  I 
don't think they can cognize or perform actions not related to fulfilling 
their initial objective.  They are a ball of higher-energy seeking to 
return to a state of lower energy by dissipating the force that binds 
them into externality by uniting with an object (as E.E. Rehmus wrote, 
"an arrow never forgets its target").  For me, the defining criterion 
that makes something a servitor is that it is always under the control of 
its creator, in that its very existence is bound inextricably to it's 
creator's desire.

The next step up, if you will, from servitor is egregor.  An egregor can 
be thought of as a servitor whose "being" is made up of the disembodied 
desires of a number of individuals working in cooperation, so that no ONE 
person creates/controls it.  Egregors are multi-purpose and often (though 
not always) have a more long-term existence, as they have been created 
for several purposes.  This is true even when all who participate in its 
creation have used the same statement of intent and expressed the same 
desire, because even though every statement of intent may be semantically 
identical, the way in which this formulated desire would be fulfilled 
will differ from person to person.  Thus, while an egregor's several 
purposes will usually be related, it is not nearly so homogenous as a 
servitor/fetch/bud-will.

Finally, there are godforms.  A god or godform is by far the most 
difficult to create, as it is (as far as I've been able to tell so far!) 
impossible for a single person to create.  Godforms may have any number 
of purposes, and (unlike the two forms above) are dependant not upon a 
single act of creation, but instead upon a series of ongoing and 
unconnected acts of creation which take the form of a series of seedings 
with desires.  As an example, I'll cite the Judeo-Christian Jehovah.  
Jehovah probably began life as an egregor created by a Semitic tribe of 
somewhat nomadic status that took its god with it during its wanderings.  
In the course of contact with other cultures, other tribes began to ask 
Jehovah to fulfill its desires - protect us from natural disasters, bring 
us justice, smite our enemies, what have you.  After awhile, the egregor 
evolved a certain apparent independence of action, to the point where it 
was credited with its own acts of creation, due to the fact that it 
became composed of a complex of desires large enough that no one person 
or group knew of all the desires that served as its formative energy (cf 
statement of intent again).  The relationship between the desire and 
attributes given to the godform by its "worshipers" eventually became so 
complex that its motives could no longer be understood by any one person 
who participated in its ongoing creation, and in fact its creators 
weren't even aware of each others motives in seeking access to the 
egregor anymore.  A godform is no longer under the control of its 
creator, and direct knowledge of all things involved with the egregor are 
no longer known to any single person or group.  Depending on the weight 
of the desire "fed" to the godform, it may even end up turning on its 
original creators eventually.  Thus, it begins (in the eyes at least of 
any given observer) to take on attributes and perform actions of its own 
will.  It begins to be described in mind and speech in more-or-less 
anthropomorphicized terms - it may appear to be wrathful, or just, or 
even insane, the last if its seed-desires become very conflicted in 
intent and gravity.  Godforms may even have important lessons to teach, 
if only because the relations engendered in it between desires, and the 
fact that it will continue to hang around after unification with the 
object of any given desire is achieved, end up creating new information 
that accrete to the godform itself.

There are as many ways of creating servitors as there are ways of 
performing any given magickal act.  My own personal favorite way of 
creating a servitor is to "mythologize" a sigil.  That is, I'll create a 
material basis sigil and then muck about with its appearance until I have 
created a sort of chimaera.  A good example of this is a thing called a 
"Watcher" that I've used in the past (and to great benefit!).  The 
technqiues I used for this are embedded in the following working:

                              +++++++++++

WATCHER CONJURATION

It is the intention of this working to create a particular type of 
servitor called a Watcher.  The Watcher's function, as its name implies, 
is to act as guardian for its creator, functioning in effect as an extra 
pair of eyes.  It may be bound to a particular place as a watchman, or 
may be of a more spatially general nature, per the specifications of the 
conjurer.

Materials Needed

Octarine-colored lights  &  Ouranian Incense  &  Material from which to 
create a figurine (i.e., clay, wax, wood)  &  Glass container  &  A 
square of silk  &  Wrapping large enough to cover the glass container  
&  Black electrical tape  &  A cigarette of any type

Preliminaries

1.  Fashion a figurine in the form of a horned serpent, and paint it (if 
    desired) in whatever colors you desire, with the exception that the 
    figurine's eyes should be in a color that forms a "flashing color" in 
    combination with octarine.  Pay very close attention to detail, and use 
    utmost skill in your creation of the figurine.

2.  Decide upon a name for the Watcher; there are no rules for this choice.  

3.  Draw upon the wrapping for the container your personal sigil/glyph.  
    This will face into the container.

4.  Inscribe upon the cigarette the planetary sigils for Ouranos (at the 
    end that gets lit), Jupiter (in the center), and Mars (at the end of 
    the smokeable part).

5.  Make sure that your working area is lit only with the octarine 
    lights, and fumigate well with the Ouranian incense.

The Conjuration

0.  Open a Vortex, ending it with the words "XIQUAL (name of the Watcher)"

1.  Place the figurine upon your altar.

2.  Recite the following invocation to Ouranos:

Io Ouranos!  Serpent of Octarine Flames!
I summon thee from within me, within me!
Io Ouranos (repeat 8 times)
The Octarine arrow pierces my creation
(Visualize an octarine eight-rayed star within the figurine)
The name of this servitor, this Watcher, is (Watcher's name)
Come, Ouranos, breathe life into my creature!
Ouranos, God of Magick Octarine
Ouranos, Serpent Octarine
Ouranos, Baphomet, Semyaza, Carmara (repeat 7 times)

Repeat the above 3 times, maintaining strictest concentration upon the 
figurine throughout.

3.  Still focusing exclusively upon the figurine, address it with the words:

Watcher!  (say its name)
I am thy god, you are my servant
Serve me well, watch for me and warn me,
I shall reward you with life;
Fail me, and I shall destroy you forever!

4.  Light the cigarette and inhale some of the smoke.  As you exhale it 
    over the figurine, chant the words "Io Ouranos" with the first drag, 
    "Io (your magical name here)" with the second, and "Io (insert 
    Watcher's name here)" with the third.  The intonation of each phrase 
    should last exactly as long as does your exhalation of smoke.

5.  Repeat step 4 until the cigarette has been entirely consumed.  It is 
    best to smoke the entire cigarette without losing any of the ashes.

6.  The cigarette being finished, rub the entire interior of the glass 
    container briskly with the square of silk.

7.  Pick up the figurine and place it upon whatever item you are 
    accustomed to using as a focal point on your altar.  Address the 
    Watcher with the words:

(Watcher's name), here is Axis Mundi!
This is my body
This is your soul!
Serve me well, watch for me and warn me,
and I shall reward you with life;
Fail me, and I shall destroy you forever!
You are my servant; I am thy god!

8.  Hold the Watcher in the incense smoke and say to it:

(Watcher's name), here is Spiritus Mundi!
This is the breath of Ouranos
This is my breath!
Serve me well, watch for me and warn me,
and I shall reward you with life;
Fail me, and I shall destroy you forever!
You are my servant; I am thy god!

9.  Place the Watcher against your own body until its temperature is the 
    same as your own, while addressing it with the words:

(Watcher's name), here is Stella Sol!
Here is warmth and succor
Here is fire and brimstone!
Serve me well, watch for me, protect me
and I shall reward you with life;
Fail me, and I shall destroy you forever!
You are my servant; I am thy god!

10.  Place the figurine inside the glass container and seal it.  Wrap 
     the container in whatever wrapping you have chosen, with your personal 
     sigil facing inward.

11.  Fasten the wrapping shut with the electrical tape in the form of an 
     eight-rayed star.

12.  Shout out, "It's alive!  Alive!"

13.  Close the Vortex and anokquz.

Notes

Once you have wrapped the glass container, it is not to be opened 
again.  No one but the conjurer should ever see the Watcher-figurine, 
and no light should ever fall on it save octarine light.  Should the 
container ever get broken, prepare a new container and transfer the 
figurine to it only after having fumigating with Ouranian incense and 
illuminating the working space solely with octarine light.

Ideally, no one but the conjurer should be told precisely what the 
container holds.
                         ++++++++++++++

Should a working similar to the above be performed by a group instead of 
by one individual, I would consider the result to be an egregor.  Should 
the resultant egregor become adopted and used by other groups not 
connected directly to the original group, I would consider it to have 
become a godform.

There are of course gray areas in this whole process that beg greater 
exploration (ain't it always the way? :), and like all definitions the 
ones I use are over-simplifications, but I hope I've gotten the ideas out 
clearly enough to be useful and not engender misunderstanding.

	Here's a shot at explaining my angle. 

	Servitors are attracted, found, or created by any of a very wide
	array of methods and pathways.

	Not all ways are intentional, and many are of very dubious authorship,
	I.E., I'm not always sure where they come from. I qualify them as 
	Servitors if they SEEK to please me, even if they don't ACTUALLY do
	so.

	I create them in a variety of ways, here are some-

	I collect Items in a bag, box, or jar (vessel from here on out), which
	said items relate to a specific focus of work. For a bookfinder, the
	vessel will at first contain a sigil built from the word <bookfinder>.
	Here is the first distinction that I am building a Servitor, not 
	making a Sigil, as a Sigil would perhaps state <I desire the Book of
	Results>, while a Servitor is a job description. I then place more
	things relating to the Job in the vessel, perhaps some blood or
	semen, perhaps some shavings from the pages of a hard to find book.
	I'll periodically address the vessel, asking it to find me books
	and lead me to them when it has found them. If I find the Book Of
	Results, if I bought it I'll put the reciept in the vessel, or if
	I find that I can xerox a copy, I copy a page of the book to place
	in the vessel. I say, Thanks, Bookfinder, how about the Theatre of
	Magick? and so on...

	Now the above actions could be said to be creation, but the above
	instance seems like attraction, like I noted what I wanted and
	something, I have no clue what, came to fill the position. Maybe
	an out-of-work ghost who likes bookstores and the Attention and
	Candy I give it.

	Sometimes I quite definately have made something. I'll carve a body
	from wood, and carve sigils and bindrunes on it, and, again, feed
	it blood and semen. I'll make up a name for it, Fritz, perhaps,
	and inculde it in my ritual work. These I tend to sleep with, and
	I breathe on them alot, too. Usually I they 'wake up' in dreams, and
	if it is a squid-form I'll dream of squid-things. Again, once it gets
	going I just talk to and tell it what I need it to do, and if possible
	carry it around in my pocket while I do my thing... I find it good
	to sneak it out and show it the world, but I'm funny that way.....

	I find things when I do an exorcism of a person or place, and I like
	the energy flux I find...I tell the critter it can come home with
	me, and join in the fun we call My Life...often they come along
	without hesitation, and sort of disapear in coming months, just
	poping up sometimes, 'DON'T WALK DOWN THIS STREET'. In New Orleans
	this happened, but I had to keep going where I was going, it was
	very much like a voice in my head, saying 'BIG NASTY SHIT!!!!', to
	which I said, 'I need to get to my bike & get home, keep me posted'.
	I got within 100 yards of my horse and it says 'SOON SOON SOON' so
	I slip my knife out & open it, keeping it well hidden against my body.
	I'm on Decatur St and all the sudden it is like everybody vanishes,
	except for two drunk frat boys, and voice goes 'THEM THEM THEM'-
	as the begin to walk past me, the closest grabs me & I let him spin
	me past his fist and open his clothes and at least a bit of him
	with the knife as I spin on past...They both bolted and ran, and
	my Voice and I went and had dinner...

	I think the basic form of Servitor is what I call a Protect-Me-You!
	Whose job is to keep you aware of danger and assist in trouble. I
	learned of these from an old Romanian woman who spoted another part
	East-European Gypsy thief at work, namely me. She told me you put
	stolen goods, broken locks, skeleton keys, nails, razorblades, etc
	in a vessel along with some of your hair and blood, and something
	from your dead ancestors, seal it up, and bury it, and for God's
	sake be more careful! A Witches bottle for thieves. I still find
	myself saying- Protect me, You! When doing Questionable things.

	I have also found that if I make alot of Sigils for related desires,
	they group together and form work-parties- becoming a Servitor.

	I must add that I have no Idea how magick works, and try to play
	as much as possible...my Servitors reflect this. Circus Bears and
	Astral Doubles of my bicycle (A Sorcerous Horse), and alot of
	shadows and dreams. I very specificaly avoid being hard-line about
	anything, and run solidly on a mixture of Desire, Intuition, and Luck.
	Of course I have Servitors for these three things who get paid 
	overtime in Candles, Candies, and Incense....

	Hoping this be helpfull

Natural Born Killers, The Demonology of Oliver Stone

Rumor has it that Quentin Tarentino, author of the original screenplay of
the cinematographic tour de force "Natural Born Killers",and the director,
Oliver  Stone, quarrelled over changes Stone made in the script.  At a guess, 
and knowing Tarentino's wildly popular "Pulp Fiction", I would imagine that
Tarentino,  fundamentally interested in the possibility of redemption from 
a life of violence through an act of unnatural intervention, disagreed 
with Stone's interest in the relationship between violence and the media.  
Readers of this article may remember that Jules, played by Samuel L.Jackson, 
the Afro-American assassin in "Pulp Fiction", surviving gunfire that should
have killed him and  his partner, regarded the event as an act of divine 
intervention and gave up killing.  His partner, Vince, played by John Travolta, 
ignored the message, and was soon shot to death.  Fans of Stone will admit 
to his continual interest in the effects of popular culture on the human psyche.  
However, Stone is also interested in the problem of good and evil, an interest 
that is neither theological (as is the case with Scorsese in "The Last 
Temptation of Christ") nor  philosophical (for example Coppolla in "Apocalypse 
Now"), but socio-psychological. His films focus on the origin of evil and 
whether  it is a conditioned response or a natural inclination.  Stone seems 
to believe that it may be both, but leans towards the nurture side of the 
argument.  In addition, his films deal with deterministic issues, the extent 
to which freedom is possible in a person's life, the extent to which the path 
of the life of an individual is predestined.
 
The film "Natural Born Killers" was generally misinterpreted as a satire on
public  fascination with mass murderers or an attack on the alleged 
encouragement of acts of violence by the entertainment industry. Neither view 
bears close analysis, despite disinformative press conferences by Stone.  As 
Jon Katz noted, Stone encouraged the perception of "Natural Born Killers" as 
anattack on the media:

>"My point was to show the American landscape in the l990s as reflected in the 
>media," Stone told his admiring America Online audience. He then added that he
>hoped Natural Born Killers would "make my audience think about the
>consequences of this social and cultural violence." 

Katz evidently swallowed this tidbit of disinformation whole, forgetting that
he was discussing a movie director whose manipulation of the organs of the 
entertainment industry has allowed him to make very popular films about issues 
that American society as a whole would usually rather forget.  Thus Stone 
directed public attention to the continuing psychic wound of the Vietnam War 
in "Platoon", the vicious treatment of Vietnam Vets in "Born on the Fourth of
July", the habitual governmental rewriting of history in JFK, the treatment of
Vietnamese immigrants in "Heaven and Earth" and the toxic effect  of hierarchy 
in "Nixon".  None of these films dealt with populartopics, but  Stone not only 
cases, from video sales rather than theatrical release. This is strong sorcery 
indeed! 

My partner and I saw the film in Key West during a rare holiday and were quite
surprised by the clear analysis of demonology outlined throughout the movie.
For readers who have not seen the film, or for those of you whose memories of 
it have faded, I encourage you to rent or buy the video, and watch it with 
your finger poised on the pause button.  The film is filled with very rapid,
perhaps only 5 to 15 frames, shots of the faces of demons.  References to
demons recur throughout,and the movie can be analyzed as an essay on demonology.  
However, the demonology presented is not the familiar grimoire of traditional 
ceremonial magick, but the black magick of the chaos practitioner. That is to 
say Stone is interested in modern, or even postmodern approaches to the 
existence of demons.  He tends to view them as psychological artefacts, but
entities of such power that they may as well be real life horned and bloody
creatures on an equal footing with human beings.  To what extent the references
to chaos magick, a form of postmodern ceremonial magick that uses popular
culture as well as traditional methods to perform magickal acts, was deliberate 
is a matter for conjecture.  I have always been of the school of criticism that 
allows a work of art to stand separate from its creator, just as a child may 
stand apart from its parent.  It is also a matter of conjecture whether the 
frequent images of coyotes refer to Native American shamanism or is an allusion 
to the chaote/coyote pun of the Temple of Psychic Youth.  However, the general 
theme of the film is concerned with the origin, development, and exorcism
or assimilation of personal demons.

The plot of the movie concerns a three week killing spree by Mickey and Mallory
Knotts, played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, the events leading up to 
this spree, their capture, and, after the passage of a year, their successful 
escape from prison.  Stone uses a variety of techniques to present this nar-
rative, including cartoons, found images, sophisticated matting, alternating 
black and white and color, historical footage and as noted above, images that
are shown on the  screen so rapidly they can almost be characterized as
subliminal.  Stone satirises a number of television formats during the film, 
including situation comedies, news programs, and "true crime" dramatizations 
of the "America's Most Wanted" genre. Film critics seemed to have been 
particularly threatened by Stone's use of satire. Jon Katz wrote:

>Oliver Stone has defected. He has joined the editorial boards, J-school
>deans, religious fanatics, righteous boomers, Janet Renos, and other
>blockheads who hold popular culture responsible for the decline of America.

Read popular film critics for popular culture and Katz' plaint becomes 
slightly more comprehensible, although just as wrong. One woders how Katz
reconciles Stone's happy ending with this alleged conservative view.

Tom Keogh, relentlessly following the pack of other film critics who persisted
in superficial analysis of the film, stated:

>And that's the problem with using the jabber of trash culture against itself: 
>It's still jabber.

While Stone certainly maintained a critique of the relationship between 
popular culture and violence throughout the film, the heart of the movie 
is concerned with more archetypal issues.

Soon after the opening scene, a prelude that features many of the dominant 
motifs of the film (apparently random coloration, stop action photography,
sudden turns into schmalz, horror, and complex visual and social jokes),
Stone uses the form of a sitcom to describe Mallory's childhood and her 
first meeting with Mickey.  In an extremely brave parody of himself, Rodney
Dangerfield,in the role of Mallory's sexually abusive father, sets the scene 
for a dramatic denunciation of the modern late Neolithic nuclear family.  
Hakim Bey has ascribed many of the problems of contemporary society to the 
decision of paleolithic society to forsake hunter-gathering in favor of 
neolithic agriculture, a choice that necessitated the development of urban 
civilization and ultimately the nuclear family. It is to be noted that Mickey 
and Mallory, during their killing spree, return to a paleolithic, hunter 
gatherer lifestyle.  Mickey, in his pivotal speech during his interview in 
prison by Wayne Gale (Robert Downey, Jr.), defines himself as a hunter, a 
kind of a feral rabbit, and as a "natural born killer". The elements that 
awaken the demon in Mallory are rapidly outlined as sexual abuse, the refusal 
of a parent to protect a child from an abuser, the need to develop violence 
as a means of self defense, and a sense of powerlessness.  These are, of course,
circumstances that are repeated again and again in the histories of the child-
hoods of serial killers.

Stone reinforces this point with flashbacks to Mickey's childhood also.Both of 
Mickey's parents are shown to be abusive, physically and mentally.  In 
addition Mickey witnesses the violent suicide of his father, and has recurrent 
visions of his father's body, its head blown off, rising from an armchair in
front of a television. Stone also points out that neither Mickey nor Mallory 
associate their traumatic childhoods with their adult violence.  Both refuse 
to deal with childhood issuesthrough conventional therapy (Mallory strangles 
the psychiatrist who asks her about her father).  Mickey explicitly denies 
that his environment made him into a killer, terming himself a "natural born
killer."   But this approach leads him to a position that cites evil as
inborn.  "We all  knew we're just a piece of shit from the time we could
breathe," he tells Wayne  Gale, and Mallory is filmed in her high security
cell singing "Born bad,  naturally born bad".  Stone's flashbacks to their 
respective childhoods, however, suggests that he ascribes their 
violence as much to nurture as to nature.

Mickey states that he understands the nature of his violence.  He tells Wayne
Gale "Everyone got the demon within you.  The demon lives in here.  It feeds 
on your hate, your cuts, kills, rapes.  It uses your weakness, your fears.  
Only the vicious survive."  However, by this time Mickey has had a year in 
prison to consider the effect of the exorcism that the rattlesnake shaman per-
forms before Mickey accidentally kills him.  Prior to this he exclaimed to 
Mallory "I'm no demon."  His self understanding has been bought at a price.

Mickey and Mallory begin their killing spree by first murdering Mallory's 
mother and father.  Mickey has been jailed for grand theft auto and is freed
from a prison ranch by an act of divine or demonic intervention that creates
a tornado and allows him to flee.  Spiral symbolism recurs throughout the 
film in snakes and tornados.  Spirals, in symbology,  refer not only to the 
cyclical nature of the natural universe, but also to discursive, dualistic, or 
discriminatory thinking.  Spirals are used to trap demons in English folk 
magick, and there is a sense in most mystical traditions that the fall from 
paradise is a result of dualistic thinking.  Thus Adam and Eve eat of the 
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil (dualism), encouraged by the demon 
snake (dualistic thought).  The murder of Mallory's parents can be seen as 
justified and cathartic, but their deaths do nothing but strengthen the 
demons within Mickey and Mallory.  Standing on a high bridge, Mickey and 
Mallory bind themselves in marriage with their own blood, and as their blood
falls, it turns into writhing cartoon snakes.  In most Eastern metaphysics,
and to an extent in western, paired snakes are a frequent metaphor for the 
lifeforce (the caduceus, the ida and pingali of Yoga).  The Knotts' wedding 
rings are paired snakes, and Mickey, at one point later chides Mallory for 
that their whole venture is worthless if she loses hers.  The suggestion is 
that the paired snakes are a symbol for psychic integration, in this case, 
Mickey hopes, through violence. Paired snakes, or a snake eating its own tail
are archetypal symbols for integration, or the defeat of dualistic thinking.
Thus the killing spree, in the terms of the metaphysics indicated in the imagery
of the film, is an attempt by the Knotts to integrate their demons, to assimi-
late them, to unify their personalities, fractured by the abuse of their 
childhood.

But violence is no solution, even violence that takes the form of magickal 
sacrifice, for Mickey's bloodletting can certainly be seen in these terms,
deteriorate, and the demons within them become so powerful that they begin to 
destroy their unifying love for one another.  Lost in the badlands, the pair 
discover the hut of a Native American shaman and his grandson.  The shaman is
played by Russell Banks, a leader of AIM, and a figure of great power in his
community.  Stone's choice of Banks to play the role suggests he considers 
a shamanist or magickal approach to violence in society both politically and 
psychologically appropriate.

The shaman tells his grandson that the demons whom he had seen in a vision  
years before havecome to their home.  Lest  there be any doubt, Stone projects 
the word "demon" onto Mickey and Mallory.
 
The grandfather states Mallory has the "sad sickness", that she is "lost in 
a world of ghosts." This is an apt metaphor for the psychic damage that is 
caused by child abuse.  It may also be a reference to one of the six worlds
on the Wheel of Samsara in Buddhist symbolism, a world of craving that cannot
be satisfied.  In Mallory's case the craving is a desire to be loved.
The boy asks his grandfather whether he can help them, and in reply the 
medicine man recounts a story of an old woman who nursed a poisonous snake 
back to health, only to be bitten by it.  When the old woman asks the snake 
why he did it, he replies she knew he was a snake and he acted only out of 
his nature.  Knowing this, the shaman chooses to help the Knotts, and, 
lulling them into a trance, performs an act of sorcery that changes Mickey 
and Mallory at a fundamental level, beginning the process of their healing.
Unfortunately, the price for their redemption is not only their capture but 
his death.  Mickey, waking from a nightmare of his childhood, shoots the 
shaman, an act that he later tells Wayne Gale is the only murder for which 
he feels remorse.  He exclaims to Mallory that he shot the shaman by accident,
but Mallory screams "There ain't no accidents", and then, in a
critically important statement says "You are death.  You killed life."  The 
precarious balance that allowed the Knotts to remain free has ended.  The two 
are captured by, in the words of Tom Keogh,"another celebrity wannabe -- an 
obsessed, sexually-deviant detective named Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore)."

Scagnetti is far more than this.  As is clarified in a series of flashbacks
and actual footage of the Texas Clock Tower massacre, Scagnetti has never been 
able to resolve his mother's death at the hands of the Texas sniper.  His 
attempt to deal with the fracture in his personality caused by this childhood 
violenceleads him to become a detective specializing in tracking down serial 
killers,but this path does not work and Scagnetti becomes that which he hunts, 
a killerhimself, strangling, in one scene, a prostitute, and in another 
attempting to strangle Mallory.  Scagnetti's abject failure at either resolving 
his own violence or possessing Mallory underscores the main theme, that 
overcoming the demons created by child abuse cannot be achieved through 
more violence. In fact Scagnetti and the Knotts are variations on a theme.

Stone suggests appears to suggest that "love is the answer".  This retro and 
superficial argument might seem plausible from a director as obsessed with
the sixties and seventies as Stone, and Mickey does tell Wayne Gale that 
"the only thing that kills a demon is love."  However, this statement is in 
the context of a speech that triggers a riot that eventually leads to Mickey
and Mallory's escape, and so it may be viewed with some suspicion.  More 
pertinent is Mickey's response as to whether he feels any remorse for the half
a hundred people he has killed.  "Was it worth it?", Wayne asks, in a piece
of magnificent insincerity for which Robert Downey Jr. should have at least
been nominated for an Oscar.  Mickey's reply is the pivotal statement of the
movie.  He responds with a question of his own:"Was an instant of my purity,"
Mickey asks, "Worth a lifetime of your lies, Wayne?"

Purity of intention, purity of action, this concept is at the base of bushido,
a Japanese reformulation of Buddhist metaphysics that allowed the development
of the samurai class.  Sakyamuni Buddha strictly forbids killing, but the 
samurai considered themselves to be good Buddhists, even though their feudal
obligation might require the taking of human life.  To understand this is 
to understand the basis of buddha mind, of yoga, or of the process by which 
a magickal intention is actualized.  Bushido maintains that pure action, 
freed of consequence (and thus of karma) is possible to one who sees clearly,
whose mind has been freed from dualistic thinking, who is no longer in a 
battle between good and evil, but understands the interdependence of all 
phenomena.  The magickal act that the Native American shaman accomplished was
to free Mickey and Mallory from this type of dualistic thinking.  Mickey voices
this when he talks about his "instant of purity".

As the riot breaks out in the prison, Mickey is allowed another "instant of
purity".  He breaks free from his captors, killing all but two of the guards
in the interview room, takes Gale, his cameraman, and two guards hostage, 
and goes to find Mallory.  He discovers her about to be murdered by Scagnetti,
who is shortly killed, and the strange entourage of Mallory, Mickey, Wayne
Gayle, and the others run through the rioting prison, apparently without
a plan of escape.

It is at this point that Stone introduces a strange character.  A prisoner
named Owen, in clean and pressed clothes appears out of the carnage and leads
them first to  a tiled room that looks like a cross between a bathroom and an 
abattoir, andthen out of the prison.  When Mickey asks him what he wants for 
helping them, he says he only wants to go with them.  Yet, after they leave 
the prison Owen is neither mentioned nor seen again.  Moreover, Owen is not 
mentioned in the credits at the end of the movie.  Owen is, in fact, "deus ex
machina".  He is Mickey's guardian angel, which until now Mickey has not known.
After their escape he is reassimilated, or returns to the realms whence he came.  
In any event, his purpose is clear.  He is there to show that the psychic 
reintegration of Mickey and Mallory has been achieved, that the magick of the 
of the arhat, the one pointedness of the magus.

Certainly, Mickey and Mallory do kill Wayne Gale, but as Mickey says, it's 
not personal.  He likes Wayne.  He kills him because the lies that Wayne 
propagates are of a piece with the lies that feed the demons of popular 
culture, the lies that discourage self-analysis, that feed ignorance, that
prevent self-knowledge, that sap the realization that the current of magick
in the world is continuous and always accessible.  Demons continue to infest
the world, but the last scene shows Mickey and Mallory years later, with 
two children and Mallory pregnant with a third, travelling the country in a
mobile home. Stone has driven home his point.  It is possible to kill the 
demons created by childhood abuse, but only through an act of divine or 
unnatural intervention willed by a sorcerer and accepted by the possessed.
This act can occur when the magickal intention is pure, and undivided.
As Mickey says "A moment of realization is worth a lifetime of prayers."

Some Brief Notes Regarding the on-Going Work of our Miskatonic                      
Alchemical Expedition 
        
by ASHT Ch0zar SSaratu1103 

Author's 1994 Preface 

This little essay was originally penned by me, Bill Siebert, otherwise 
known as AShT Ch0zar SSaratu,in 1987 for confidential distribution to 
members of the Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition (MAE) as part of an 
on-going project to create a body of written material to prepare those 
seeking initiation into this Ophidean/Elysian Mystery School.  

The MAE was designed as a syncretic mystery school amalgamating the 
techniques, world views, and mythologies of all participants --ideally, 
without bogging-down in disputes of dogma or hierarchy.  Before talking 
about MAE, I will give a bit of background on myself. 

Since 1967 or so, I have been actively involved in magick and paganism, 
albeit as a solitary.  In 1977 I probationed in and became an initiate of 
the Typhonian branch of Ordo Templi Orientis headed by Kenneth Grant.  I 
remained an active member of this Thelemic Order (attaining the rank of 
V) until 1984 when I was suspended (later to be expelled in 1985) by K.G. 
because he felt my Will was not aligned with that of the Orders.  In 1981, 
I co-founded Math of the ChRySTAL HUMM, a Shamanic/Alchemical Thelemic 
Powerzone based based in an old rundown farmhouse with 23 acres of rolling 
fields & woodlands <our ritual space> in upstate New York.  In retrospect, 
I believe my Great Work parted from Grant's mainly because the focus of my 
Will was at that time going into my on-going magickal endeavor to reify an 
ecumenical thelemic powerzone & profess house, rather than devoting myself 
more fully to promulgating the Law of Thelema under the aegis of KG and the 
Typhonian OTO.  

In 1985, I became one of the three founding Sovereigns of the Chthonic-
Auranian OTO, branch of the OTO-- a wholly new manifestation of the Order 
claiming no imprimatur from Crowley, and doing away <as much as possible> 
with hierarchy grades & restraint of individual enthusiasm.  The Chthonic-
Auranian OTO is dedicated to exploration-&-union of the Dark/Light 
Mysteries of all onic formul.  At about this time, I also became a 
regional coordinator of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, a Lovecraftian 
Mystery School descended from the Sirius mystery cults of egypt Babylon & 
Sumeria, by way of Gateways within creative individuals who are capable of 
dreaming the mythos, and making it accessible even to those who do not 
believe their dreams to be real.  It was into the maelstrom of these mythic 
forces that the Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition took form and birthed 
itself at Math of the ChRySTAL Humm  some where in 1986 or 87. 

                                 * * * 

It is now 1994.  A lot has transpired since this essay was written.  I 
left Math of the ChRySTAL HUMM in the hands of friends in 1988 to pursue 
the study of Megapolistomancy within dance clubs and dirty back streets of 
Buffalo New York.  About 1989 or 1990 Math of the ChRySTAL HUMM 
reabsorbed itself back into the void from whence it came.  The house & land 
which were the physical basis for this powerzone has been foreclosed upon by
the banks.  The Chthonic-Auranian OTO is alive-&-well, prospering under the 
guidance of its many capable Sovereigns.  I have been out of contact with 
the EOD since 1988.  From what I have been able to ascertain, the EOD is 
no longer operating on the outer.  

The MAE has been evolving in fits & starts since parting from the 
nurturance of Math of the ChRySTAL HUMM powerzone in 1988.  The MAE is, a 
living viable Current --from my perspective, alive and growing within each 
of us who played with its magick at Math of the ChRySTAL Humm.  Yet, 
although I believe the MAE is a many headed hydra, I can only speak of it 
through the lens of my own personal experience.  Synchronous with my own 
personal journey of re-discovery, the MAE has become a wriggling 
semi-somnolent pupa dormant within me --absorbing & reifying a new 
megalomanic context to augment its elysian primal nurturance.  The 
1994 publication of this essay is designed to arouse the Miskatonic 
Alchemickal Expedition from its six year hibernation to begin its work 
anew. 

Currently, Bill is living amidst the social decadence, political 
corruption, and stagnant decay of New Orleans with his wife-&-Priestess 
Raven Greywalker.  Together they are studying and learning arcane 
mysteries from diverse encounters with various megalomanic 
power-spots and with the plethora of individuals whose ancestry and 
magicks stem from an amalgamation of Haitian and African Voodoos, strange 
native American magicks, even-stranger heresies brought here from France 
and Spain by various prisoners of conscience fleeing from the long arm of 
Inquisition and Crown --as well as those not-quite human fringe-people 
whose swamp, bayou, & river ancestors possess a certain bactrian look 
analogous to their Innsmuthian kin, yet with an indolent balefulness not 
often found beyond the foetid nurturance of Louisiana's biological social 
spiritual and political backwater.  Compounding this genetic, spiritual, 
and ethnic mire is an on-going influx of disaffected and disenfranchised 
persons from the world around, drawn to New Orleans by its astral and 
literary beacon proclaiming it to be a Mecca for the weird.  

Into this complex milieu, AShT Ch0zar SSaratu awakens once more to prod 
the hermit, Bill, into literary fecundity. 


                            Original Preface 

   
Lest there be confusion, let me state here that this little essay is 
written from my own personal internal perspective.  I feel strongly that 
most of my fellow expedition members would agree with the content of what 
I am saying, but many of them might find my vocabulary a bit unfamiliar. 
Among Thelemites, our expeditions are currently known as Holy Guardian 
Angel Workings.  Back in the days when our expeditions were less focused, 
some (who placed themselves on the fringes of our endeavors) called our 
workings Pagan Parties.  Gatherings is the most common local term.  Up 
until recently, I have been rather silent about my intense internal work 
with Lovecraft's Mythos -- preferring to keep my Lovecraftian magicks to 
myself, while integrating myself consciously & openly into whatever 
mythology my fellow expedition members were weaving.  But the time for 
silence is at an end.  With this paper, I begin to open the inner workings 
of my personal mythology, the Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition, to all who 
may be interested working this Current. 


                           Preliminary Remarks


The purpose/methodology/tools of the Miskatonic Alchemical Expeditions 
are difficult for me to put into words.  The expedition is not a dream 
school in the way I use that word.  Our work involves physical plane 
waking-consciousness magickal endeavors.  The expedition is a coordinated 
anarchistic group endeavor to create an environment in which 
dreams/phantasies/visions are projected outward within our working group 
(Circle).  We assist individuals to reify their internal Universes within 
waking consciousness with intentionality & responsibility.  

I sometimes feel that the word Initiation is a bit mis-used/over-used, 
but I feel that it does indeed apply to aspects of our work.  In my 
experience (corroborated by K.Grant), initiation cannot be guaranteed thru 
any rite.  Initiation is a connection which jumps-starts an individual 
into an exalted state of consciousness.  Initiation is rather elusive, & 
sometimes appears to be transient.  I have found that initiation works most 
powerfully when the initiatory link is clearly made in both directions--
i.e., when the initiator & aspirant keep playing leap-frog with one 
another-- so that both experience a powerful initiation, and each is very 
clearly aware of (& acknowledged for) h-is/er role as initiator.  

I suspect that one-way initiations accrue karma, which neutralizes or 
masks the long-term effects of traditional top-down initiations --at least 
until the initiator dies (or leaves office), or the initiate severs 
connection with the initiating Order to formulate h-is/er own internal 
initiatory links).  Perhaps commercial initiators (such as those in 
various New Age Spiritual Psychology Movements) charge steep fees for 
their services as a way of absolving the inhibitory karmic link in the 
here-&-now. 

As I say, we do not claim to guarantee initiation.  We provide a 
setting, a set of tools, and a community, by which we assist one-another 
(and selected outsiders) to activate our self-chosen and ever-evolving 
phantasy reality during daily waking consciousness --i.e., in our 
"ordinary" lives, not just during our rather intense rituals.  Attempting 
to comprehend our work intellectually can be very misleading, especially 
if mental gymnastics are not grounded in actual day-to-day experience of 
our work.  As I attempt to convey the flavor & intensity of our work, I 
sometimes get the feeling I am attempting a task of the magnitude of 
conveying an experience of chocolate mousse to someone who has lived h-
is/er entire life on a diet of un-seasoned white rice, stale bottled 
water, & vitamin pills. 


                               Set-&-Setting


The setting for our rites is (ideally) primitive & isolated --where the 
niceties of civilization (morals, clothing, social taboo, etc) can be 
consciously put-aside by each expedition member individually, each in the 
manner/degree which is in accord with each individual's True Will.  During 
our all-night Circles, some people revert to a pre-human or a 
non-terrestrial state, while others retain their human persona as they 
channel information from alien races (or gods, angels, demons, etc).  Some 
--who become uninhibited, sexually aroused, and who have located <one or 
several> suitable partner(s)-- make love in total abandon; while still 
others commune within the sexual energy field in non-physical ways, &/or 
talk with trees or crystals.  For this type of Working, the setting must be 
isolated so no one feels the need to stifle or edit any energies which 
come pouring thru. [As I said, all this doesn't make much practical sense 
unless you've experienced it firsthand!] 

On some occasions, some (or all) of us create-&-perform group Dramatic 
ritual to coordinate the mindset of the group at the on-set of our free-
form all-night Shamanic Circle.  Whether or not we stage a formal ritual, 
we encourage each person in Circle to do whatever personal ritual(s) &/or 
energy balancing s/he feels would assist h-im/er in manifesting h-is/er 
inner self.  We then communicate various entheogenic sacraments to assist 
us (individually & as a group)in manifesting trans-rational consciousness.  


                            Entheogenic Elixir


[addendum made in 1994: Of the various entheogenic elixirs which we 
experimented with from 1980-88, the basic recipe we found most efficacious 
was composed of a concentrated infusion of Psilocybe cubensis stems-&-
pieces (prepared after the manner of Soxlet) in cool 190 proof grain 
alcohol.  This elixir was then concentrated by distillation of excess 
alcohol until insoluble waxy residues began to accumulate in the bottom of 
the flask.  The slurry was filtered while hot and the filter paper then 
washed with hot ethanol to resolve any active constituents trapped in 
the residue.  The filtrate and the ethanol washings were combined, then 
diluted approximately 50/50 with Chambord raspberry liquor, then stored in 
a home freezer till a few hours prior to use.  {Preparation time: 
approximately 1 week @24 hours/day.} At an appropriate moment during the 
all-night ritual <as the cone of power was being raised>the elixir was 
diluted approximately 50/50 w/ Coca Cola.  The sugar, caffeine, and alcohol 
included in this process were all found to be sympathetic adjuncts to the 
active entheogen, psilocybin.  The estimated dose of psilocybin was 
approximately 75-300 mgs per serving.  Although traditional 
ethnopharmacologists claim 50 mg.  to be the maximum useful dose of 
psilocybin, I have found that doses far in excess of this to be 
efficacious given an appropriate Set-&-Setting.  During our expeditions, 
some persons regularly consumed 3 or 4 servings over a 4-8 hr period.  
When available, an additional drop or 2 (1000-2000 mcgs) of liquid LSD per 
person would be added to the cup as well.  At a few other times cannabis 
infusions in ethanol were added to this basic recipe, but massive amounts 
of THC made the elixir too lethargic and had a tendency to give some folks 
a bad case of the spins every time they turned their head.  Human kalas 
(consecrated sexual fluids) were often added to the cup just prior to 
consumption.  Rescue Remedy, a homeopathic stress reliever obtainable thru 
Heath Food stores was found useful in helping quiet the jitters of too 
rapid a "take-off".] 


                         Sacramental Guidelines


We have found that certain guidelines (which we are constantly 
up-dating) are useful for sacrament consumption.  From my perspective, I 
find the following to be quite useful: 

a). Some form of ritual in which a common sacrament is consecrated 
jointly, then communicated.  Usually, we use a cup ritual -- both for its 
esoteric symbolism & so that we can truly share in the same sacrament.  
The elixir we normally use is always brewed with unknown potency, so that 
it becomes virtually impossible for the rational self to meter the dose.  
I find that the rational mind (my own, & most other folks as well) is 
often fearful of the transition to trans-rationality via the un-rational.  
Once the leap has been made, the rational mind has a lot of fun 
integrating/assimilating trans-rational reality, but the first approach 
can be real scary sometimes.  Perhaps we detect subliminal astral 
presences, such as the Hounds of Tindalos or the mad flute players, which 
then induce panic in the most intrepid of explorers! 

b). In conjunction with the cup ritual, each explorer is asked to state 
why s/he is in attendance.  Flippant, shallow, or incomprehensible answers 
are clarified thru further interactions.  If clarification does not prove 
to be feasible, that person is asked to leave the circle.  In formal 
Circles at major Festivals involving strangers, we also collect money for 
sacrament at this time, while ascertaining that each individual has met 
all of the pre-requisite criteria (e.g.: having personally cut-&-hauled 
their weight in firewood to the ritual site, being willing to remain in 
Circle till the morning sun is visible in the dawn sky, vowing to handle 
any bad-trips responsibly --i.e., without projecting them outward into the 
group at large, etc. 

c). The texture, contrast, & clarity of the Working is greatly increased 
if in addition to the commonly-shared sacrament some explorers 
communicates individual sacrament as well -- each in accord with h-is/er 
own Will.  I call this interaction of individual alchemical energies the 
Orchestra Effect.  Each individual sacrament provides an attunement to a 
unique perspective on the Multiverse, while our shared sacrament ties-us-
all-together.  Practically speaking, each individual gains access to 
simultaneous experience of many unique perspectives, usually (but not 
always) while maintaining h-is/er unique individuality.  Some sacraments 
(such as Euphoria) promote mentation, while others (such as 2CB) encourage 
emotive feeling.  Telepathy (both on a rational level & via the sensorium 
of the hind-brain) is common in our Circles.  Once, one of our explorers 
seemingly stumbled thru solid matter.  On another occasion several of us 
witnessed another explorer handle hot coals without being burned.  During a 
very early expedition, a water glass began to over-flow like a fountain, 
while the glass remained full to the brim.  At one of our 1985 
expeditions, we experienced a tornado and thunderstorm inside a tent, with 
winds was so fierce that I was unable to fall-over no matter how hard I 
tried, while a camera 20 feet away remained dry & was not blown from its 
flimsy tripod.  As I keep mentioning, The work of our Miskatonic 
Alchemical Expedition is not easy to talk-about in a purely rational 
context! 

d). Internal balance is crucial for this work.; The philosophical 
framework of Thelema (discovering one's Will & DOING it.)  coupled with 
the EST technique of being "At-Cause" in one's Universe can induce an 
aspirant towards creating an approximation of a karma-free state -- 
i.e.,no hidden strings jerking h-im/er around).  I sometimes remind myself
--as well as all others within hearing if I am being extrovert at the 
time-- that if I am at-cause in my Universe and Doing my Will, then there 
can be no un-willing Victims in my Universe, all Persecutors act in a 
conscious manner, and I have no need for Rescuers.  On a micro-cosmic 
level, we council nutritional awareness & personal transformative alchemy.  
All-night rituals can prove taxing to those who live their lives by 
external clock cycles.  Sleep deprivation, vitamin depletion & depressed 
blood sugar levels can bring all sorts of un-resolved issues out in the 
open and into manifestation, especially when energy levels are all 
cranked-up by powerful ritual, sexual prana, and entheogenic stimulation.  
While I feel it is essential to dump &/or transform toxins and to play-out 
all un-resolved conflicts, I encourage expedition members (this includes 
me, too!) to do their homework --all-night vigils, eating what they 
consider to be a nutritious diet, fasting & an on-going regimen of 
personal introspection/meditation/ritual work-- before engaging in 
powerful transformative group workings.  To promote balance at our 
Circles, we encourage one-another to take vitamin/mineral supplements.  
Lately, we have begun to have some sort of pot-luck meal (melons, Bar-B-Q 
on the ritual bonfire, fresh bread, etc.) during the wee hours of the 
morning, when our human biosystems can sometimes be starving for some food 
prana (but we are often too busy to notice!). 

Conscious & deliberate use of sex, entheogenic sacrament & ritual 
within a supportive setting all assist the rational mind to gently step 
aside, while opening-up the Third Eye & Crown Chakra.  The elixir 
mentioned supra --inspired by Doctor Laban Shrewsury's hermetic mead-- is 
most efficacious in facilitating this state, especially when used in 
conjunction with other alchemical compounds which open the Heart, enhance 
Sexual Creativity, or activate &/or stimulate the other chakras. 


                    Samadhi & Dissolution of Duality


When all chakras are open & functioning at their highest levels, there 
does not seem to me to be any meaningful purpose in attempting to 
distinguish between humans-&-gods, angels-&-demons, good-&-evil, or 
reality-&-fiction.  Each person becomes intimately connected-to/congruent-
with h-is/er personal phantasy reality.  A Buddhist may realize that s/he 
is the Buddha or transcend that state of attainment to become one with the 
infinite; a Lovecraftian mage may experience sexual union with Cthulhu or 
discover that s/he is at one with the chaos of Azathoth; a Christian may 
become the Christ, or may experience Jesus & Lucifer as two facets of the 
same cosmic gem.  A person may identify with h-is/er genetic past, or with 
some extraterrestrial race.  S/He can become a totem power animal, or come 
to a realization of being a human incarnation of Gaia.  

I am not talking about intellectual comprehension here.  Intellectual 
comprehension of the merger of the mundane with the transcendent is not 
difficult for anyone with a well-developed ego &/or sufficient spiritual 
pride.  [Many students of contemporary Western magick fit into this 
category.] The rational mind is more than happy to convince itself that it 
is God.  I am not speaking of that kind of realization.  I am speaking of 
full-fledged actualization (samadhi coupled with focus of individual Will) 
of godhead. 

It is also possible to actualize total union with the cosmic ALL/No-Thing, 
but commenting further on such a state is beyond the scope of this essay. 


                          Real Work of the MAE


I find things get really interesting when someone realizes that even 
though s/he can indeed choose to be Christ, Buddha, Azathoth, Satan, ET, 
Gaia, a virus, etc., s/he can also choose to be fully-actualized in-&-of 
h-im/er-self --i.e., as Jane or Fred, or Stacy.  When the ego stops trying 
to be God, & becomes a god instead, the real work of our Expedition begins 
in earnest!  If/When an explorer becomes aware of h-is/er cosmic nature, 
and is able to ground h-im/er-self in trans-rational reality, it then 
becomes feasible for h-im/er to interact with other cosmic beings --
neither limited by Space, fixed in sequential Time, nor locked-out of any 
particular reality framework.  Within this cosmic framework, all who work-
&-play here jointly create reality. 

[Note: It is also quite possible to create total-&-complete Nightmare and 
propagate terror thru-out the Multiverse, or to rend the fabric of Maya 
completely.  I do not recommend this course of action as a group endeavor. 
Likewise it is possible to tap-into the Cosmic All/No-Thing as a mystic, 
rather than as a magickian (i.e.,from an ego-less state with no point of 
Will).  That too, I find to be a rather solitary undertaking.  I have 
involved myself with each of these endeavors on various occasions in 
myriad different lives within infinitudes of alternity.  Each is powerful, 
educational, & <seemingly> necessary to the multiverse (at least as I know 
it).  Hindus call this cycle Brahma/Shiva/Vishnu (named after gods of 
Creation/Destruction/Preservation).  From my present perspective, I find 
co-Creation with other cosmic beings to be the most fun challenge in the 
Multiverse.  Destruction is too easy & preservation is not to my 
temperament.  So I have made Chaotic Creation (i.e., Creation with no 
central god figure to coordinate things) the focus of my lives' work.  I 
co-create pleasant evolutionary realities by working with those on similar 
paths.  Although destruction & preservation are indeed woven into the 
fabric of my existence <I kill plants-&-animals to eat as well as for my 
personal convenience; I reprint classical texts to preserve their message 
for future generations>, I leave grand Rites of destruction, and 
performance of un-changing Ritual to those who enjoy these endeavors!  The 
Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition specializes in evolutionary creativity.] 



   Depending on: 

<1>how many persons in Circle are able to manifest as cosmic beings, 

<2>our ability, Will, & desire(!) to recognize others who are in a similar 
   state, and 

<3>our ability/Will/desire to assist those who are still in transition, it 
   is sometimes possible to create a very powerful self-balancing mutually 
   gratifying Mythological framework.  Within this larger Mythological 
   framework, it is common to have functioning magickal eddy-realities, 
   within which the interfaces of each personal reality dance with 
   one-another.  

   

   To phrase it another way -- SaSaR (Sex & Sacrament & Ritual) combined 
with close camaraderie amongst expedition members, & a shared set/setting 
of Circle-space & expectation, induces the boundary edges among people in 
Circle blur.  The slightest thought (whether expressed or stifled) 
manifests within our collective reality. [As practitioners of Kria Yoga 
teach: Thought is Creative!] This newly actualized creation can be 
channeled, focused, &/or modified thru acts of Love under Will.  As the 
evening progresses, Reality (i.e.,our collective Maya) takes on a mythic 
flavor (exactly which mythos depends on how each participant has prepared 
his/her internal mind-&-emotional set ahead of time and the degree to 
which s/he is willing &/or able to share (via poetry, ritual, 
storytelling, lovemaking, conscious touching, chakra stimulation, 
fire-walking, etc) h-is/er personal Mythos with the rest of us.  When our 
weave of rational/emotional connections is sufficiently powerful, 
conventional reality dissolves completely and our jointly-created fantasy 
takes on mythic proportions.  Individual dreams weave together & play 
themselves out in our waking consciousness, not just in private 
dreamspace. 

 Our work might be likened to Psychodrama, but with a focus of reality 
engineering.  Israel Regardie once wrote that magical attainment is 
independent from psychological balance.  Such limited attainment may well 
have once been the norm when most magickians worked solitary, but (to me) 
the quest for magickal attainment must include active exploration of 
psychological edges --the places where insanity and genius are all but 
indistinguishable-- or the magickal endeavor is simply not worth my time & 
effort.  The Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition uses various psychological 
balancing techniques to make the exploration of edges easier & more 
productive, but as we learn how to achieve-&-maintain balance, our work 
escalates, rather than slacking-off.  We work Magick (inducing Change in 
harmony with Will), not just mental health.  Our dream enactment is 
collective, rather than individual, so that our personal quirks balance 
one-another out --which is one of the main reasons why our expedition 
contains a varied cross-section of individuals.  This provides a 
clearer/cleaner contact with (& actualization of) energies than is usually 
possible in a solo working, no matter how advanced an individual adept.  

   

   We have no "faculty" in our expedition.  We all explore together. 
Some of us have more experience than others, but we play leap-frog adeptship 
with one-another so often, that it does not make sense to me to designate 
a faculty.  We do, however, have a core group of intrepid explorers.  We 
have a local core of Thelemic magickians, augmented by individuals & sub-
groups from other well-developed magickal powerzones.  New members for our 
expedition seem to manifest as we become ready to handle their energy.  For 
some, one expedition is sufficient for a lifetime.  Others drift in-&-out 
of our Circles as they discover themselves & test-out their point-of-Will. 
Let me point out once again, that I am at the center of my personal 
universe.  Everything I say is grounded in my own personal perspective --
which is to say, with me at the core of the expedition.  Yet, from the 
perspective of some other member of the expedition, I may not even be in 
the core group at all!  

   

[Note made in 1994: Now that I've given you all sorts of non-hierarchal 
disclaimers about how I may or may not be in the core group, lets get down 
to some details!  Appended below is the text of another introductory essay 
I penned which approaches the MAE from another angle, that of an 
initiatory Order.  What follows was once given in secrecy to a select few.  
I ask you to treat it as you would any other Secret document --in the 
words of Herman Slater's now defunct Earth Religion News: 

                Protect the Mysteries, Reveal them Daily!

                              Practicum 

  The Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition is field-trip oriented R-&-D 
community which operates within that sentient web of initiates known on 
the outer as the Esoteric Order of Dagon (EOD).  From my perspective, the 
Mis katonic Alchemical Expedition operates hand-in-hand (perhaps tentacle-
in-hand may be a better euphemism) with the Chthonic-Auranian Branch of 
the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). 

   It is assumed that each applicant to the Miskatonic Alchemical Expedi 
tion of the EOD is a functional Thelemite whose understanding/appreciation 
of the Mythos is based upon direct personal magickal experience with outr 
energies, not merely an academic interest in the literary genre of weird 
fiction or a sociological/psychological interest in those who 
channel/advocate the Mythos.  That is to say, each applicant is expected 
have an understanding/appreciation of Will, Love, and personal 
responsibility from a Thelemic perspective, be willing/able to put these 
precepts into practice in his/her daily life, and be willing/able to 
function as a Thelemite within magickal community.  Each applicant is 
further expected to submit on-going records of magickal workings, dream 
diaries, fiction, essays, &/or evocative Art which demonstrates his/her 
vital connection with the Mythos as a magickian or a mystic.  Magick may be 
defined as causing change in conformity with Will.  Mysticism (in this 
context) may be defined as a passive link with the Mythos which generates 
syncretistic harmony &/or dissolution into the Mythos itself. 

   Initiation into (or affiliation with) the Chthonic-Auranian OTO is by 
no means mandatory for affiliation with the Miskatonic Alchemical 
Expedition.  Members of other branches of the OTO, as well as autonomous 
Thelemites are welcome within the ranks of the MAE.  The EOD does not 
require acceptance of Liber AL vel Legis as a requirement for membership.  
The MAE does, however, require that each expedition member accept Thelema 
and live by an individual ethical code of Will, Love, and Personal 
Responsibility.  Whether you accept the veracity of Crowley's channeled 
writings is up to you -- concepts are important, not packaging! 

   I strongly urge all those interested in active participation in the 
Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition to apply for membership into the EOD. 
Although it is possible to work with the Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition 
in the short-run without formal affiliation with the EOD, I do not 
recommend this course of action for the long-term.  I find that formal 
affiliation is synonymous with commitment.  I have found that those who 
cannot --or will not -- commit themselves to an organization are (in 
general) not dependable.  The on-going work of the MAE involves deep 
serious personal commitment -- not only to your own personal Great Work, 
but to the local & global community in which we work/play/grow/explore 
(both individually & collectively).  Hangers-on often become deadweights.  
We are building an ever-growing group gestalt, whose food is a shared 
information base & an ever-evolving group mythology.  Personal Commitment 
to the group is a first step towards formulating perfect love & perfect 
trust which is our primary sacrament. 

[Note made in 1994: While I still agree in principle with the sentiments 
expressed in the previous paragraph, there remains the difficulty of 
locating functional Magickal Orders worthy of one's loyalty and support. 
Since neither the EOD nor the MAE are presently functioning on the outer, 
and since (in all probability) the Chthonic-Auranian OTO does not have a 
functional group in your area, I can make no reasonable recommendations at 
present.  In my personal experience with myriad Magickal Orders, which <for 
the nonce> shall remain nameless, I have found far more spiritual 
corruption than true enlightenment, far more power games than fellowship 
or brotherhood, and far more hiding behind paper initiations to cover 
ignorance, than open sharing of knowledge or admittance of ignorance -- 
e.g., "I'm truly sorry, but even though you have been experimenting with 
VIII carezza for over three months now, I am unable to discuss your work 
with you because to do so would be inappropriate, for the mysteries you 
are exploring are `beyond your grade'.  If & when you have earned access to 
our Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis, I will be more than happy to 
discuss this topic with you more at length" (Soror 789, circa 1977).  

   While I still contend that refusal to work within the structure of a 
magickal Order can indeed be a symptom of egoistic imbalance, working within 
a corrupt Order is no solution.  All I can do at this point is wish you 
good luck in your search!] 


                          The Focus of Our Work

   From my perspective, the work of the Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition 
is always evolving & does not really fit into neat categories.  Chaos does 
not lend itself to description in a linear essay format.  Although I have 
chosen to speak of the work of the Expedition as though it could be 
separated into neat little boxes, such categorizations can be misleading.  
Needless to say, the little boxes I portray are my own. 

   [I once had a vision of entering the abyss by a rear entrance.  All of 
the various gods, demons, angels, and other sundry beings were lounging 
about playing poker, skinny-dipping in the great sea, and otherwise 
enjoying each other's company.  Then someone saw me & began shouting over 
a PA system: "Qliphoth to your shells!  God/desses to your Spheres!  
Everybody get into your boxes!"  -- In the abyss (as in this world) 
everything overlaps.  Neat boxes exist only in the minds of those who 
choose to separate their life experience into categories.] 

   On an individual basis, members of MAE utilize techniques of conscious 
dreaming, astral projection, & self-induced trance states to explore 
various realms of dream, nightmare, & vision.  As we re-enter normal 
waking consciousness via the gateway at Dath <which (to me) typifies the 
energies of Herschel (Uranus)>, expedition members focus their dream 
images into conscious awareness & outward expression via Hod (writing, 
scientific/magickal technique, etc.) or Netzach (Art, Music, etc.).  It is 
within this realm that exploration reifies personal initiation within the 
here-&-now. 

   On a group basis, members of Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition utilize 
Shamanic (Netzachian) & Ceremonial (Hodian) magickal techniques to focus 
their individual consciousness & the gestalt of the group itself thru the 
astral gateway at Yesod and into the worlds of dream, myth, and 
creativity.  These expeditions are undertaken as group endeavors to 
manipulate/explore the worlds of dream without the need to give-up waking 
consciousness. 

                  On the Dangers of Over-Specialization
       
   It is my feeling (based on personal observation of my own imbalances & 
much research over the past two decades) that over-emphasis on individual 
exploration can lead to introversion & isolation which borders on the 
pathological.  A solitary magickian wakes-up alone.  S/He becomes aware of 
his/her inherent trans-dimensional nature apart from a community of peers. 
S/He works the Path of the Hermit in order to tap-into his/her initiated 
self.  Adepts of this path progress rapidly to become Masters of the inner 
planes, but often at the expense of being able to relate to their fellow 
humans as anything other than tools for their personal trip.  For within 
the initiatory context of vision & dreamspace, everything is a projection 
of the self outward (a diagnostic tool to speed integration of 
personality) &/or a spirit sent to guide the initiate upon his/her path.  
It is easy for a hermit to become an exalted adept --yea, even a God.  But 
(all too often) s/he is not able to perceive the initiation of others who 
work analogous formul of attainment.  Smug superiority over his/her 
magickal comrades coupled with fear/loathing/disdain of those whom s/he 
considers to be mundane often limit the degree to which such individuals 
are able to manifest their true natures in the here-&-now.  
   

   Aleister Crowley, Nicola Tesla, Austin Osman Spare, and H.P. Lovecraft 
all spring to mind as examples of initiates who woke-up alone.  Each was a 
genius.  Each had a profound effect on the world I live in.  Yet, each was 
severely imbalanced in his relationships with other people.  Tesla was 
perhaps the most extreme.  He could not tolerate being touched.  He felt 
it disturbed his subtle magnetic fields.  He once moved a thousand miles 
from his home simply because someone put his arm on Tesla's shoulder!  Of 
these 4, I feel that Crowley worked most diligently to balance his 
solitary inner plane Workings with connection to community (being 
tapped-into non-solitary sex magick probably helped a lot)!  But in 
community, he acted as though he were the most advanced initiate on the 
planet.  Based on the number of people who moved in-&-out of his life, it 
would seem that he was somewhat difficult to be around for protracted 
periods of time.  He surrounded himself with people whom he used as tools 
&/or endeavored to re-form into images of himself.  I learned a lot from 
Crowley.  But, after many years of being a Hermit, I am now working to 
balance my exalted Hermetic initiations with group interactions within a 
community of magickal peers. 

   On the other hand, I am finding that those who work almost exclusively 
in community (Wo/Men of Earth) can also grow in an imbalanced manner.  As 
my personal experience with this formula is more limited than my hermetic 
experience, I can more readily perceive the weaknesses of Wo/Men of Earth 
than their strengths.  The Hermit perceives the Universe as being a tool 
for his/her personal initiation.  Hermits are cosmic children.  The 
Multiverse is their school & playground.  Wo/Men of Earth are cosmic 
parents.  Sometimes they get so caught-up in being responsible that they 
seem to have forgotten how to play. 
   

   When Hermits & Wo/Men of Earth clash, it is often over the role of 
healing/nurturing.  The Hermit wants to play games of initiation & create 
heroic mythologies.  The Wo/Man of Earth wants to play parent or healer.  
There are times/places for games of high initiation, and times/places for 
games of healing & nurturing.  When these two currents work in balance, 
everything is copacetic and magick flows on all levels.  To me, the 
positive interweaving of the magicks of the Hermit & the Wo/Man of Earth 
create a space in which the godform of the Lovers can manifest.  
  

  Problems arise (from my perspective) when time/space has been set-aside 
for initiatory game playing, and True initiation occurs.  Under such 
circumstances, the flow of raw magickal power thru an unfolding gestalt 
can sometimes be mis-perceived as a symptom of a disease process (e.g.,a 
psychotic episode, life-threatening physical ailment, magickal attack, 
etc), rather than as a positive initiatory experience.  A Wo/Man of Earth 
who is not able to tap-into his/her Hermetic godform has a very strong 
tendency to intervene in a nurturing/healing way -- even when those 
energies are counter-productive to the Work-at-hand. 

   From my perspective, a gestalt is a functional magickal organism.  Each 
individual within that gestalt takes on specific function(s).  Sometimes a 
person will breathe as though s/he is hyperventilating, or somebody else 
will stop breathing, altogether.  Neither is dangerous.  During one 
initiatory experience, I stopped breathing for over an hour (timed by a 
clock) without any serious repercussions other than a splitting headache
the following day.  While in another gestalt, a very powerful Hermit was 
working intimately with Fire.  A Wo/Man of Earth attempted to intervene -- 
for she felt that the Hermit might hurt herself.  The Hermit was self-
possessed enough to laugh at the Wo/Man of Earth, then pick up some hot 
coals to demonstrate that she was able to care for herself -- magickal 
reality was maintained!  

   But such a high degree of self-possession is rare, even among highly 
skilled Hermits, when they operate in a group gestalt.  Worry trips (no 
matter how well-meaning) can throw me off-balance.  I might have suffocated 
had I been surrounded by well-meaning nervous nellies who wanted to rush 
me off to a hospital.  The woman who handled fire could have been 
seriously burned if her certitude faltered at the wrong moment.  I have a 
much easier time manifesting paranormal phenomena in my solitary work.  I 
have become quite used to clocks running backwards, and seeing strange 
alien beings looking out at me from my bathroom mirror. 

[By the way, I was quite cognizant of paranormal manifestations many years 
before I began my researches with psychoactive sacraments!] 

   In my opinion, a Wo/Man of Earth who is over-due for an extended 
magickal retirement is real prone to ground the group's energy whenever 
s/he feels threatened by feelings/thoughts/phenomena which clash with 
his/her reality framework.  In extreme cases, lack of emphasis on 
individual personal development seems to manifest as an underdevelopment 
of an individual's Hadit-Point, making him/her susceptible to major freak-
outs during group workings.  I perceive freak-outs as being related to 
feeling a loss of center when each individual Hadit-point merges into the 
group gestalt. 

   If a freaked-out person gets sick (allergy attack, faints, etc.)  &/or 
projects his/her dis-ease outward onto an empathic receptor in the group 
gestalt, the group energy is effectively re-focused from High magick to a 
medical/psychological emergency, which (it would seem) is more normal to 
some than the initiatory paranormal universe which I prefer to inhabit.  By 
dampening, stifling, or distracting group energy, the imbalanced Wo/Man of 
Earth effectively limits/disperses exponential initiatory growth which 
gestalt consciousness engenders, unless s/he can be brought to balance by 
other members of the gestalt.  

   This is where I feel the Lover comes into play.  Those who embody the 
godform of the Lover are able to relate to both the Hermit and the Wo/Man 
of Earth without losing center, and without becoming judgmental of where 
the other person is coming from.  A Lover is able to relate to each of the 
wonders/joys/responsibilities/challenges of being a Hermit and of being a 
Wo/Man of Earth --without losing perspective on that which transcends each 
separate task.  A Lover is a Peacemaker who unites all in Love under Will.  
Lovers are (from my perspective) a godform which ameliorate the 
functioning of Hermits within community, and Wo/Men of Earth within 
paranormal reality.  

   Mathew Henry once commented that peace is such a precious jewel that he 
would give anything for it but truth.  The godform of a Lover is sometimes 
attempted by those who do not really understand what is like to be a 
Hermit or a Wo/Man of Earth.  In such an instance, the ersatz Lover may 
attempt to smooth things out, without really being able to catalyze 
resolution.  Such practices (in my experiences) lead to a fracturing of 
community.  To me, a Lover is functional as a balance-point between 
Hermits and Wo/Men of Earth only insofar as s/he is able to relate to both 
via personal experience, not just empathy.  

  I speak of Hermits, Lovers, and Wo/Men of Earth as though they are 
separate beings.  Such over-specialization (if it really existed) would be 
ridiculous.  I am working on all three grades -- as is everyone I know!  
The appropriate balance of Hermit, Lover, & Wo/Man of Earth within each of 
us is a highly delicate & ever-evolving balance, which we explore & fine-
tune on an on-going basis.  I encourage (& expect) each Expedition member 
to work/play/explore with those individuals/groups he/she/they may feel 
are appropriate, using whatever techniques he/she/they deem useful-- 
There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt! 

[Please note: As this essay is being published long after the demise of 
Math of the ChRySTAL Humm Powerzone during a period of somnolent 
dormancy of the EOD and the, the following section, Affiliation with the 
Mis katonic Alchemickal Expedition, is included solely for the sake of 
completeness.  At present (1994) there is no MAE or EOD to apply to, so no 
address will be printed.  Those involved in a Great Work similar to my 
own, may contact me c/o the editors of this magazine.] 


          Affiliation with the Miskatonic Alchemickal Expedition

   We cannot initiate anyone into the EOD.  We do not feel that initiation 
of this kind can be conferred from without --it emanates from within as 
the result of personal exploration & synthesis.  Initiation is a personal 
process of flowering/unfoldment.  Initiation is a side-effect of getting 
in-touch with one's self, and discovering/creating relationships between 
one's self & the rest of the Multiverse.  Although the EOD does not confer 
initiation, we are willing (yea, even eager!)  to recognize initiates by 
the fruits of their labors --their magickal/creative output. 

   If it is your will to seek affiliation with the Miskatonic Alchemical 
Expedition of the EOD, please send me a personal letter stating your will 
in this matter.  Let me know what you feel you have to offer our group & 
what you are looking to get from your association with us.  Please include 
your biography (earth-plane as well as magickal), along with any pertinent 
information about yourself & your personal explorations which you are 
willing to share at this time.  I would really appreciate a recent photo of 
yourself, along with your birth data (date/time/place).  If you are 
involved (or have past affiliations) with other magickal groups 
(local/regional/international), please tell me of your experiences with 
them insofar as you are able without violating any confidentialities or 
oaths of secrecy. 


   Acceptance into the Esoteric Order of Dagon requires some form of 
evidence of your activity in the Great Work.  Evidence can include any/all 
of the following: samples of your dream record, records of Magickal 
Workings, essays on magickal technique/philosophy, creative magickal 
fiction &/or Art (or photographs of your Art) which demonstrate your 
connection with the Mythos.  Those who are new to communicating their 
visions may find it useful to use fiction as a vehicle of expression. 


  Dream fragments which provide detailed description of rituals, alien 
entities, bizarre settings, &/or actual text (or artwork) from astral 
books or manuscripts are particularly useful to other dreamers.  But even 
brief fragments of dreams can sometimes provide a key word or image which 
another dreamer is seeking.  If your artform does not lend itself to 
written or pictorial evidence, please discuss your work with me.  I am 
sure we can come up with some method for you to demonstrate your activity 
in the Great Work. 


   Be sure your letter requesting affiliation with the EOD contains your 
legal name & mailing address, as well as the magickal name (or motto) by 
which you choose to be known within the EOD.  Your application will be 
evaluated personally by me, shown to members of my close magickal family, 
then forwarded (with comments/recommendations), to R'yleh Lodge.  What you 
submit may become a permanent part of the EOD's Library of Dath &/or the 
library of the Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition.  Submitted material will 
not be returned to you.  Please do not submit original manuscripts or 
artwork, unless you are donating them to our library.  


   Neither the EOD nor the Miskatonic Alchemical Expedition charges dues 
or initiation fees.  You are expected to pay only for those goods & 
services which you specifically request.  Donations to help pay for 
postage &/or to support our on-going publishing projects are always 
welcome.  As material flows into the Expedition library, I will make 
copies available to other Expedition members who request them.  Individual 
expedition members are requested to submit material to me for internal EOD 
use.  We encourage expedition members to submit material directly to the 
Library of Dath at R'yleh Lodge & to Black Moon Archives.  Material 
submitted to me will not be distributed to the general public unless you 
tell me it is ok for me to do so.  


                             1994 Postscript


   Despite the optimism with which I penned the above essay some seven 
years ago, Math of the ChRySTAL Humm and the Miskatonic Alchemickal Exped 
ition have both crumbled into dust.  What happened?  To say it was time 
for me to "move-on" or to "continue my magickal journey elsewhere" begs 
the question and answers nothing.  To write detachedly of the fall of the 
interlocking powerzones which I helped create and which in-turn gave me 
birth, is both beyond my ability, and would serve no purpose other than to 
allow me to beat my breast and air my grievances.  Rather than play Hamlet 
or King Lear, I choose to eschew the realms of linear reality to speak 
allegorically of that which I am too enmeshed within to write of--either 
honestly or compassionately. 

   Sometime in the mid 1970's, I was becoming more active in the Typhonian 
OTO.  I asked my then superior, Soror Tanith, why it was that Magickal 
Powerzones came together around a core of dedicated people, generated lots 
of energy, which in-turn attracted more people to the powerzone --only to 
have the whole thing eventually collapse in on itself, never to be heard 
from again?  Tanith answered that she felt that a powerzone was, by its 
very nature, impermanent.  Her answer was too pat and far from satisfying, 
but by its very nature, her answer created an itch in me (much like a bit 
of grit in an oyster) to explore this question further. 
  

   From my present (1994) perspective, it seems to me that powerzones are 
willfully created transient magickal engines--which are also unconsciously 
engendered immortal inter-dimensional organisms-- which attract ingenious 
and imaginative magickal beings to itself, who then drive themselves into 
a frenzy of taboo-breaking cross-fertilization in an effort to find &/or 
create mutual understanding and give birth to a new world --in which they 
give birth to one-another and themselves.  Inadvertently, these Bornless-
Ones also create spores of mutant magickal memes --initiatory multi-
dimensional tinker-toy mandalas which catalyze transubstantiation of human 
and trans-human consciousness in all who play with them.  When the spores 
reach maturation, some cataclysm (egoistic dissonance, financial strife, 
external persecution, etc.)  breaks-up the harmony of the incubating 
powerzone womb & the (now defunct) powerzone spreads its initiatory spores 
into the void to co-mingle & cross-fertilize with other spores from myriad 
defunct &/or living Powerzones, Magickal Orders, Occult Philosophies, etc. 
to continuously spawn new magickal engines and organisms wherever the 
confluence of forces find favorable alignments of Stars.  


  Thus, when the cycle of eons has ended, and the Phoenix returns in 
weariness to Heliopolis for its self-appointed immolation, it is not the 
end, but a new beginning.  For out of the ashes of the dying Phoenix arise 
dust motes which swirl and congregate under the influence of a billion 
whirling galaxies to coalesce --giving birth to myriad new phoenixes, 
strong in the vigor of their youth, shrieking orgiastically as they fly 
thru the worlds of (wo)men and their gods exploring conquering & remaking 
maya into their own images --as godlings are wont to do! 


   Anyone up for some interdimensional perichoresis?

    Node TAZ would never have existed if the editor had not met the following 
    contributor, founder of node Curious Yellow(Z), and the mage who introduced
    the editor to chaos magick.  Here's what he had to say about his node:
    
    A Note from Curious Yellow (Z)

        
        It seems a good time to lay out a bit of what this node of the
        (Z)Cluster is up to and attempting, as well as an attempt to put
        some old dogs to rest...

        Curious Yellow (Z) is interested in using modern Chaos Magick wed
        to archaic (UR) Sorcery to:

        A) Bring on the Coming Bad Times
        B) Slow the coming on of the Coming Bad Times

        We are somewhere between the Secular Apocalypticists ("It's completely
        hopeless-- Don't give up" DOOM) and hoping all the lies of the media/
        corporate deathculture interface suddenly become true. Thus we
        simultaneously are against a world run by petrochemical giants, but,
        since we are in that world, we'd like the fins back on the cars,
        please.

        C) We accept that the Pandaemonaen is either an internal state of mind
        or an utter failure, and so seek to make a happier place for sorcerers
        and their children in The New Dark Ages.

        D) We will generally attack anyone verbally/textually whom we feel
        mis-represents themselves not out of any major ethical problems with
        the practice of duping the rubes, but out of disgust with those who
        do it poorly.

        E) We wish to state clearly at this time that we have NO PROBLEM with
        the existance of Hierarchical Organizations or their members. We make
        fun of them, but, as a wise girl once said to me "friends don't let
        friends sell their souls to Jesus." We have nothing against Jesus,
        Satan, OTO, IOT, what have you, but we will be abusive to all the
        above periodically, because it is a pleasant thing. Fire, in and of
        itself, is cool.

        F) We seek to establish a series of Autonomous Zones wherein we may
        exist in the bittersweet bliss of Mystical Indolance and Magical
        Sloth. Sorcerous Avarice and Childish Greed. We are a Cult of
        Mystical Magickal Sorcerous Children, and we are tired of the Old
        Gods and their spiritualy vapid followers shitting in our sandbox.
        The sandbox becomes strangely hostile, the Healing Wind casts sand
        out of the glass into the Eyes of the Blind, we sing a little ditty
        in the dust to wake the dying....

        G) We hereby request that all Verbs begin a series of workings/plays
        to re-inhabit the National Parks of the United States of America
        with mean  old ghosts to lead the developers into massive fits of
        incontinance and stuttering. The humiliation will drive them to rash
        deeds of unbelievable destruction, but we'll be able to spot them
        by the tell-tale bulge of their pampers. This is in reaction to the
        various bills in Congress which will destroy our parklands, our
        true National Heritage. Save the Presidio! or at least do something
        really cool to it.

        H) This has been a presentation of Curious Yellow (Z), which, until
        somebody else re-affiliates, is

   ____________________________________________________________________________
   
      
	Elements of Sorcery-- The Fireclown 	Method Explained
	
		By The Fireclown, age Eight.

	
	"The universe wants to play. Those who refuse out of dry spiritual
	greed & choose pure contemplation forfeit their humanity-those who
	refuse out of dull anguish, those who hesitate, lose their chance at
	divinity-those who mold themselves blind masks of Ideas & thrash
	around seeking some proof of their own solidity end by seeing out of
	dead mens' eyes." Hakim Bey

	And play it will, with you, as a friend, with you, as cat to mouse,
	with you, through you, in you or on you, the Play is the Thing, and
	while No-Thing may be True, some nothings will stomp you flat if you
	don't direct them. And play it will, but it is best to keep in mind
	the universe has had a lot of time to get good at all facets of the
	game, so be aware...

	"Laughter is the only tenable attitude in a universe which is a
	joke played upon itself... It is not for us to question the
	universe's apparent lack of taste." Peter Carroll, Liber Null

	So, if we are going to play this game, whose rules seem to be only
	vaguely outlined in the manual that came with the deck, and as well
	are changed with every new layout or technique tossed into the soup,
	we are advised to approach it with humor, as grace is quite
	likely to be denied us from the get-go.

	These are the watch-forms the new practitioner should look for when
	seeking examples to follow in this most peculiar art: humor and grace.
	If you come across a sorcerer who is full of grace, they most likely
	have some tricks you can steal or trade for. If you meet one with 
	his humor intact beyond the realms cynical, see if you can figure out
	how they manage it. The course of sorcery tends to create radical
	stress on the bodymind, and either of these states (grace/humor) can
	be read as the practitioner is not (practicing, that is), or has dug
	enough holes for Hirself to fall into that they've learned to like
	it, if only as a wake up call.

	"Sorcery: the systematic cultivation of enhanced consciousness or non-
	ordinary awareness & its deployment in the world of deeds & objects
	to bring about desired results." Bey, again

	Lets look at this one: "Magick is the art and science of causing 
	change to occur in conformity to the will." Aleister Crowley

	Note the differences. They seem minor, at first, but grow as one shifts
	point of view from one to the other.

	Crowley's definition of magick seems to me too wide: the picking up
	of a glass of water and drinking of it is Magick. However, is it only
	Magick if you WILL to do it? What if I'm typing, and don't even notice
	what I've done? What, for that matter, if I spill the water or knock
	the glass to the floor? Did my magick fail? No, I'm just klutzy. All
	this talk of will, this Religion of Will, and the strange attraction
	to call it a Science...these all seem caught up together in the dread
	Magick.

	"Virtue: pure art." Austin Osman Spare

	Now to me Sorcery is no science, it is purely an art, and is not an
	art of Will but of Desire. A Sorcerer is one who Desires intensely,
	and who has acquired a knack of having his desires reciprocated. Will
	can be crucial, but also, not-willing seems equal to the task. The
	cultivation of non-ordinary states of consciousness is the primary task
	of the sorcerer, not ritual. In these states connections are noticed
	or made, a process of reticulation unending, a process of weaving
	webs, of soldering connections, and of feeding the network created 
	or discovered. 

	Sorcery takes things as they are, and seeks to maximize communication
	and information exchange within the fields of manifestation. There
	is an odd story I will relate:

	I was speaking with a Magician, of the Golden Dawn variety, who is
	very successful at his work, and we spoke of Angels and Demons. He
	was telling me of the testing processes used to determine if the
	entity he was working with was REALLY the one he conjured. This was
	a very involved process, sort of testing the critter via word and
	numbers, gematria etc. I was laughing quite hard at this point, and
	luckily, he knows me well enough to not take offense. I had to ask
	why he had conjured the beast to begin with--did he not have some
	task for it to fulfill? Why not just give it something minor to do,
	and if it could pull it off, then continue working with it. If it
	failed, see if it was good at some thing else. 

	I find the attitude above fairly common among those who choose
	'sorcerer' as a title. I wonder what would happen if you called
	the plumber, demanded his full name, business records etc., and then
	told him you'd kill him if he didn't fix the toilet right. This seems
	a somewhat common attitude among Magicians, though, and I think it
	has a lot to do with what skills are required for the type of work
	generally done. The Magician is expected to be knowledgeable about
	Astrology, QBL, Tarot, Mythology, Astral Travel, and various formulas
	for evocation, invocation, etc... and these skills, once learned,
	need to be used or one feels ones time has been wasted.

	For the sorcerer, the only thing he must be good at is finding what
	is needed, usually from an unusual state of mind, and pulling on the
	proper threads to get the desired result. Now, when you are working
	with a self-generated symbol system, you don't have to have it be
	coherent, explainable, etc., YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT.
	You just need to be able to use it. I think of GD/Crowley style magick
	and I think of a school of mechanics, wherein one learns all about
	design and construction of cars and such, and maybe gets a degree or
	two, and then goes off to design cars. I tend to think of sorcerers
	as those who discover that it would be good to know how to change
	the oil/belts/tires/and various filters so as to keep the car happy
	and on the road, and be able to fix it if it breaks down. If the car
	gets into real trouble, they see if they can learn to repair it, or
	take it to the Temple of the Gearheads (a particular meeting/work
	place for AutoSorcerers) and have them fix it. The goal is to keep
	the car on the road, not to understand cars in their totality.

	The term sorcerer, when one looks into it via it's Indo-European
	roots, can mean 'one who lays out lots'. This is, I would assume, a
	reference to the runes. Now, if a seer is a diviner, one who sees
	and makes prophecy, we have a clear division of labor. Using the
	runes as an example, you are a seer if you draw three runes and 
	then base your actions or inaction's on the result. You are a
	sorcerer if you lay out the runes to indicate your desired outcomes,
	and charge them in some fashion to force the hand of chance to
	facilitate these outcomes.

	From the get-go, the sorcerer is seeking to manifest Hir desires.
	S/He does this through odd states of consciousness. Hir ethical base,
	Hir battery of techniques, and model of the universe are built up
	on the foundation of experience. Their is no manual for sorcery, their
	is no Order of sorcery, their is not even a common symbol-system or
	definition of sorcery.

	Some others definitions of sorcery:

	"Sorcery is the art of using material bases to effect magical
	transformations." Peter J. Carroll, Liber Null

	Sorcery is "The art of using material bases to enhance a magical
	conjuration, the outcome of which is determined by the sorcerer's
	will."  Nicholas Hall,  Chaos & Sorcery

	sorcery (noun). Magic; performance of tricks with pretended help
	from evil spirits, witchcraft. Websters illustrated dictionary, 1949
	(note: are they evil because they only pretend to help?)

	The idea that sorcery is just magick using material bases is common
	in Carrollian Chaos Magick, but seems a not too useful definition.
	This goes back to the old High Magick/Low Magick (and Black/White)
	rationale wherein we rate magick not by it's effect, but it's methods
	and appearances. I will stick with my own definitions, as I view
	Sorcery as subtly different from Magick.

	"The incremental openings of perception gradually banish the false
	selves, our cacophonous ghosts--the "black magic" of envy & vendetta
	backfires because Desire cannot be forced. Where our knowledge of 
	beauty harmonizes with the <ludus naturae>, sorcery begins.

					Hakim Bey
		
	The opening of perception, and the banishment of false ghosts? What
	does this mean to a Sorcerer, one may well ask. Are we speaking of
	Visualization Exercises and the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the 
	Pentagram?

	I do not claim to speak for anyone, and my interpretations of Bey's
	words are just that, but I do not think these are what he is 
	speaking of... meditations and visualizations and pentagrams and rites
	are not Sorcery. However, for many they are the precursors to it. 
	These things are tools for an internal garden, 'a rooting out of the
	weeds, a watering of the flowers' as Crowley has it. They serve to
	still the mind, to clear away 'our cacophonous ghosts', the structures
	imposed upon perception by the discursive mind. The discursive mind
	is very good at many things, but Sorcery is not one of them.

	Banishing, in the ceremonial sense, is good for preparing one for
	meditation, which in turn is a good preparation for the state called
	by Chaoists "no-mind", or vacuity. Once the talking self is quieted,
	and we cease to impose structure upon sensory input, our perceptions
	open to a different kind of sensing, which I call sensualizing.

	Sensualizing is experiencing with the full bodymind, and stops when
	we begin to define the experienced. When we sensualize, we move from
	a core of 'reason' into a sphere of pure knowing, or gnosis, which
	is closer to touch or taste than 'thinking'. When we taste the Virtue
	of Salt, there are no questions. Salt is. We can describe and compare
	the taste, the texture as it dissolves upon our tongue, but we come
	not close to the Is-ness of salt.

	I seek to live simply, to touch freely, to influence utterly and so
	be influenced--and fail miserably, falling into fits of manic 
	laughter. Or succeed, and find myself pulled, called, conjured into
	a purity of Desire. From this failure I fuse into a bodily need for
	contact, a rapture of excess seeking, and from the excess, into no-
	mind. "There is no need for crucifixion", "Does not matter, need not
	be." Austin Osman Spare

	The endless cycling though Desire and Despair ( and yes, Death and
	Dream and Delirium) births me into an abundance of beauty and fear
	wherein I encounter slight threads, knotted together into a net of
	jewels, a fine and lovely trap. I touch this thread and the baby
	wakes, and this one brings rain.

	
	The trick in Sorcery is that there is no trick. The key to Sorcery
	is Inexplicability. That which can be explained, scientifically
	proven, used to convince skeptics and make your teeth whiter and
	brighter, is not Magick. If your seek 'a good reason' for your acts,
	...'he who hesitates is lost'-Crowley. No shit. I know magicians
	who think this is a threat, which is merely a fact, easily observable
	in any big city, at major intersections and on the edges of tourist	
       	 spots.

	In the next installment, we will tackle the problem of Grace,
	if we can find any positive examples....

   	Fireclown's Sigilization Basics for the Confused

   	OK, so you haven't read Liber Null, Practical Sigil Magick, the
   	Grey Book, Visual Magick, or anything else on Sigil Magick, and
   	don't have any money and/or hate books anyway. May this brief
	bit of fluff aid you in some way.

	HISTORY.
	Sigilization, or Sigil Magick is generally attributed to Austin
	Osman Spare. I feel he got the idea from drawing up monograms as
	a child, or perhaps from looking at watermarks on paper.
	END OF HISTORY SECTION.	

	THEORY.

	The general idea is that Magick functions on a subconcious/deep
	mind level, and that the logical/discursive mind only hinders
	the manifestation of results. It does this by
 
	1) _Lust of Result_,

   	and
    
	2) constantly denying the possibility of manifestation. 
   	i.e.,_I can't get laid 'cos I'm a bastard!_, or 
         _I'm stupid and clumsy,and have no social graces,
         therefore I can'e be a waiter, even though I really 
         really want to be one_. 
        
	There are other reasons, but I'mnot going to go into them here.

	Therefore Sigil Magick seeks to implant and embed directions and/or
	desires into the deep mind in a way that goes unoticed/unopposed by
	the rational/discursive mind.

	PRACTICE.

	Take a statement of Desire, containing no negative words, and write
	it out.

	I WANT TO FUCK BOOTSY COLLINS  (used as an example only)

	But no, that's not quite right...too vague...

	I WILL FUCK BOOTSY COLLINS

	Yes, thats better. Forceful is good.

	Eliminate repeat letters.

	IWLFUCKBOTSYN

	Now make the letters into a monogram of sorts.

 	\    /|\    /
  	 \  / | \  /
   	  \/  |  \/      diagram simplified for ASCII
             (|) 

	Anyway, you use all the letters left over and make a little picture.
	This is your _seed_, if you will. 

	Now, forget all about Bootsy for awhile, and take your little picture
	and PLANT IT!

	There are a variety of ways to do this, and we'll look at some.

	1) gaze at the Sigil, whilst jerking off or fucking, it
   	   will embed when you come.
   
	2) gaze at the Sigil, and hurt yourself.
 
	3) gaze at the Sigil, and hold your breath 'till you pass
   	   out. It embeds when your head strikes the altar.
   
	4) strongly visualize killing someone you hate.
           Then visualize your Sigil.

	5) strongly visualize making someone you love very happy, and
   	   visualize your Sigil.
   
	6) combine any or all of the above. The more contradictory,the better.

	7) meditate to vacuity, and when vacuous, visualize Sigil.

	Obviously there are many ways to do this particular Magick Trick,
	just as there are as many rabbits as there are hats to pull them
	from. The most important bits to keep in mind are: make you Sigil
	nonrepresentative of your desire, try to forget what the sigil is
	for, and I reccomend deystroying your Sigil as soon as you plant it.
	I will also be heretical here, and say one should not record their
	experiments with Sigil magick, and if they do, keep the records
	extremely vague. One good way to do this is to seal the paper used
	to work up your Sigil (perhaps the finished and charged sigil as 
	well) in an envelope marked only with the date performed. Don't
	open the envelopes for at least six months. Still, I think that
	fast create/embed/destroy cycles work best.

	Let me know of any questions, as well as fun or especially painful
	tales that arise from these practices. These will be collected in
	a future article, called 'Sigils as Harbingers of Personal Apocalypse'
	to be assembled when enough tales of mindrending horror amass.

******************************************************************************

The Z(Cluster) is an international association of chaos magicians. Few
facts are more persuasive of this assertion than that the third node in the
Cluster was Zona Majika Automota, or ZMA, founded by Martin Knutsen in 
Norway shortly after the publication of "The 12 Principles of Chaos" on the
Internet.
	
Martin announced the formation of ZMA with a founding document of his own:
	
		Hep.
	I am pleased to anounce the formation of a new group of the Cluster,
	ZALIVA MAGNIFICUS AZEROTH. Together we shall concuer thw world...
	Our knowledge is small, our hunger great and our contacts many, so 
	this should turn out to be a strange and wonderful journey.
	ZALIVA MAGNIFICUS AZEROTH - THE MANIFESTO.

	------------------------ FIVE -------------------------------------
	I sleep, therefore I am a dream. As my dreams are as real to
	me as my "reality", and as they present a much more precise
	description of reality than my so-called senses, I will
	choose to explore, and if possible describe, the visions
	and symbols inherent in my brainstem.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	-------------------------TWO----------------------------------------
	As Magic/Magick/Art is the Art/Working of change, and
	since all change must come from yourself, I shall strive
	to achieve an understanding of what is, and what is not,
	at any given time, a part of what I choose to call Me.
	Thus, I may know the factors, and thus , I may know the
	non-factors of symbols that exist eternally and at the
	same time, only within my head.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------

	------------------------ SEVEN-------------------------------------
	As kaos is all, then kaos is nothing. To believe in
	nothing, is to believe in everything. All is true,
	and that is a lie.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------

	-------------------------THREE-------------------------------------
	The realisation of kaos poses a question of survival.
	I will choose, for a while, to react to the fact of
	lifes total insecurity with an absolute belief in
	what I think of as right. When all possibilities
	are equal, the wise man chooses his own, and lets
	other choose theirs. Total freedom means total self-
	responsibility. You are what you do, and myths and
	memory are the only traces we ever can leave behind.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	--------------------------TEN--------------------------------------
	As no truth is absolute, knowledge can only be justified
	trough results. I will work, through what I define as Me
	at this time, to produce something. The aim of the product
	shall be to capture the essence of my being, like a flash
	of beauty. If nothing is true, then every sensation is
	eternal.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	------------------------THIRTEEN------------------------------------
	We are all Gods, and therefore responsible unto the whole
	universe. I shall not forget one single sensation in 
	my lifetime, I shall keep it stored in my brain-stem and
	explore it at night. I devote my nights to the study of
	patterns and the movements of matter that together create
	the beauty of kaos.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	----------------------TWENTY-THREE----------------------------------
	We are all created by kaos. We will all return into kaos.
	Lets have fun while were at it.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	More recently Martin has declared a system of magick:
	
	____________________________________________________________________
	
	An Introduction to ZMA's Majik
		
	Perhaps we should present our Selves. Zona MAjika Autonoma
	is a individual organisation affiliated to the Z-Cluster & the 
	Origami tribe, as well as to the legend of A:. A:. . When we say
	this, we do not mean that we are within the Thelemic current, as
	we find this a rather pompous & absolute dogma. Rather, we are
	deeply in love with the idea of the wise old men carefully building
	a pyramid of knowledge, a framework accessible by everyone. We are 
	deeply fascinated by kabbalah, wich to us is one of the few non-
	moralistic explanations for the symbolic structure of reality. 
	The way we see it, the structure of kabbalah/tarot/myths/i-ching/etc.
	can be likened to a piece of hardware, a common symbolic structure 
	we all can interface with. The Z.M.A. sees itself as a software-
	designer/ symbol-hacker, we try to find easy angles to complex
	structures, simplifying & condensing things down to basic, and then
	start building again. Z.M.A. is also a political organisation, it
	is our stated goal to find a form of magik that can be employed as 
	a tool of combat against those bastards dragging the world down.
	O.K. Here is our basic breakdown of magik, wich has earned
	me the curse of an officer of the O.T.O.

	------------------------------------------------------------------
		ISI  MAGIK
	------------------------------------------------------------------

	1) Every man & woman is a star.

	2) A star can be analysed in three parts: Its emanations, its body
	and its core. Emanations for a person are its doings, its body can
	be called Ka & broken down into the four elements, while the core
	is Ki & represents that wich is us, God within. As above , so 
	Below, As Ki so Ka, and opposite. 

	3) Ki can be described as a structure of continual opposition, 
	where positive & negative (passive/active, male/female, Chaos/order)
	is in continual conflict, creating the third point of reaction.
	Classic gnostic marxism.

	4) The art of magik is the introduction of a fourth element into this
	pyramidal structure of thought, thus breaking the structure of binary
	coding that the brain is taught, and creating a much more complex
	structure. This fourth element can be as easy or as complex as wished,
	personally we like things as simple & honest as possible. Only through
	retaining the childmind can we remain pure, is one Z.M.A. slogan.

	5) The formula is : 3+x=4. Isi magik.

	---------------------------------------------------------------------

	As we are getting ready for publishing a more comprehensive look into
	this, as well as our own system of work, we would like to hear any and
	all comments to this. As earlier said, we have been told that publishing
	this will earn us curses & doom by a high-grade O.T.O. officer (who
	also called it "pathetic, inconsequent, inconsistent, stupid & mega-
	lomanic", so much for the stoic magician, smile), wich is why we choose
	to get reactions first. We find it kinda neat, we are not saying this
	is "the official truth, inc." but quite a handy tool...
	---------------------------------------------------------------------

	Last words: Remember , my friends, what we actually are doing here on
	the net. The game we are playing is one of the absolute oldest, the
	traditions we are using as skipping stones are something men have died
	for for thousands of years. Remember that money is magik, that all
	abstract thought can be analysed using these tools, that energy is
	emotion and that all movement may create resonances, then think about
	the amount of pain & doom/gloom being generated everywhere. The aim 
	of the Z.M.A: is to create a pure note of defiant hope & anger beneath
	the noise of all these traitors of wonders.

	Peace.
	M.K. (Z.M.A:)
	
	_______________________________________________________________________
	
	In a variation on the above two documents Martin recently reformulated
	his founding principles into a series of statements:
	
	_______________________________________________________________________
	
	          		ZMA  -  THE STATEMENTS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

			ONE
All your thoughts are lies, including this one. Therefore, the only 
solution is to choose.

			TWO
To paraphrase a great man : Will is the Law, Will under Love. Each man is
perhaps a star. He may also be a rather silly display of fireworks..

		       THREE
All the world is shaped of patterns, and the paths of the patterns are
perhaps ruled by their own internal logic, but beyond and above it lies
chaos, and further than that we have not been able to come.

		       FOUR
If you are looking for a meaning, you better look elsewere. The only thing
you will find here, are some mildly hallucogenic effects and a scary view
of the world. No shrinks available...

		       FIVE
If you are decided to strike, strike hard and true. The beauty of perfect
being embodied in action, pure and clean, is a rare thing to behold. Let
your body learn tricks without the conscious aid of the brain.

		       SIX
And if you chafe at the word beauty, thinking it yet another flowery remnant
of the boy-fuckers of ancient Empire, then remember this: If time is but a
blink in the eye of Godhead, should we not then be the lightning etching the
memory of our being eternally into his thought?

		      SEVEN
For as we come down to it, this is what Chaos is all about : To be able to
surf, and to do it with a certain sense of personal integrity and with a 
style that is defined by yourself. Chaos is the slacker answer to serious
study, we Choose the left hand path freely, we go by intuition through
these mazes of symbols, perhaps one day finally reaching the end of
The Fields We Know. And would it not be a True experience, to happily go off
into the mist?

		      EIGHT
Always try to communicate freely, and with an open mind. This is a dying art
an art worth keeping alive, but remember also that there are as many tricks
of persuasion as there are trees in the world. To paraphrase another great
man, "If you are doing business with a magickal son of a bitch, get it in
writing".

		      NINE
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel. Always remain in 
control, never surrender yourself, never accept another mans wisdom without
questioning, never Ever take anything for Truth.

		       TEN
ALways remeber that we are in a situation of combat. We do not have the time
for small details, we are fighting for our lives.

FOND...MEMORIES...OF...THE...PAST...

There are few things in a man's life that can be compared to riding through a 
snowstorm,high on speed and handling a heavy motorcycle. That feeling, when your
vision is reduced to less than three meters and your reactive ability is limited
by the fact that any movement with sufficient force to break the sheets of ice
stuck to the frame is likely to send you flailing and screaming into the nearest
snowdrift, to be found and eaten by laps or wild reindeer, is what we Norwegians
live for. As Lemmy says it:"We are born to Die, We fight to Live." Or to quote
my friend the Rat,who just got busted on murder charges :"Doesnt matter when you
go, as long as it is fun" Which always reminds me of my old friend Patrick
Buchanan. Tonight, Eye see ole Pat is on television again, making sure his
margin of 20-25 % of the republican party is right behind him, toting their
home-made bombs & waving their M-16s. Patrick Buchanan, or "Slime" as we used to
call him back in the sixties, is an old old aquaintance of mine. We were riding
with the angels when the name still meant something, before the snake-people &
these God-rotting aeonites & boyfuckers surfaced with their whole new brand of
slimy evil. Eye can remember a day, out in the Mojave, me & Pat were doing the
rites of Light, writing mile-long sigils with the dust-trails of our bikes in
patterns readable only to those smiling spirits we had on our shoulders,
laughing. We initiated that whole fucking period, we charged and recharged that
whole era,together with a whole lot of other stonecrazy mothers & fathers 0f the
Edge. We were not "Dionysian" or "Appollonian", we were outside those dualistic
platitudes so common now, we were action, not fucking boring. But then it broke,
and the kapita-lords took hold, and we had to make a decision. Any of you out
there remembering the gathering of the tribes in 69? It was, in my mind , like
a scene out of a book, the clans who never had managed to be united suddenly
facing imminent defeat and coming together in one last council. As the sun
settled on those high mountains, we sat around the fire, and one by one made our
speeches....Most of them was the usual gibberish, about how the militants had
betrayed the peaceniks and how the peaceniks had lacked the gut to do anything
but talk, and so on ad nauseum. As Amanda Wyldenleaf of house Boorish was
getting ready to speak,Pat had enough. He jumped into the circle and held one of
the best speeches in history. It went something like this:

"Brothers and sister! Fuckers and wankers! Hello! We have been listening to you!
You suck!There is an enemy a-coming,and this is a war-council! What are we going
to do...? You sit in silence, all of you. Well,let me tell you a few things that
shall come to pass:...There will be a scourge, and a cleansing, and blood on the
tracks. They will shoot, and maim, and burn, and loot our dreams. They will
molest our children and their longing for Greenspace, they will bind us and hold
us and give us the choice between rape or consent. They will bow our heads, or
cut them off. You dont like it....Hell, I dont like it, I fucking hate it. That
is what I am, hate, and that is my trade, so how am I gonna turn this..? We, who
are the children, we should be fucking smarter than this, we should be able to
dance away... I propose, before the council, the following : We of the People
will hereby disappear, like a song into the woods, a remnant of an echo. They do
not want myth, let them face reality in kapital. Let us flood the victors with
their own victory. Let us infiltrate and poison and stupidify and bind them to
their own binding. They seek to shape a spell, let us help them then, like Puck
helps the Lovers. This is my suggestion, to let go of the dreaming and leave it
to them, and let them roast in their own fat....There will always be children."


There was silence around the fire....People were looking at each other, only
Lemmy seemed to get any kind of kick outta the raw energy delivered. Pat looked
around him with wild eyes, then laughed. He looked like a maniac then,dressed in
Black jeans and a biker's vest, a powerful man in a wild time, getting ready for
his last Faustian crusade. "Eggsuckers, rot on you" he screamed, and did the
signs of rejection , condemnation and confusion in such a rapid series of
movement his hands seemed to blur. Then he went out, jumped on his bike and
roared away into the night. The rest, as they say, is History. The council broke
up,  Pat Buchanan became Nixon's speechwriter.Soon after the deathcounts started
rising. As my old friend William S. says:...It was a time when passion attracted
bullets. William, William, you were always my hero, old even among the oldest,
looking at the world and daring it to look back, icecoldmachinery and sinister
complexity... You never introduced me to St....gysin, though, not before it was
over, not before it was down the drain..Cold Paris backstair table and syringe,
the dying is thing a word,cut up tit.William was the one who did not not come to
any councils, anytime one of the leaders came even close to him he would sneer
something about the Mahariji, and turn away....Eye can see him in Chicago, him
and Jean Genet refusing to move. "Gonna get hurt anyway, wont give them the
pleasure of seeing me run".  Now if he had run for president, with Pat Buchanan
as a PR manager, that would have been a spectacle.... Vote Gysin/Burroughs...
For a stranger America... Laugh...

But we seem to be drifting, again. We were talking about Patrick Buchanan, and
his last curse, his life's work. It seems clear to me that the act of becoming a
magician in these terms means that one shapes the world around itself. Pat,being
the craftsman he is, understood that a man might escape into this, and never
reappear,like the pebble and the river. Pat didnt want this. He went back to his
own Cabaal, and they laid their plans. What you have to understand about these
Shatanists, is that they are not evil in the absolute term. They dont take
pleasure in their craft, only sick animals do that. Their intent is a tactical
one, they wish simply to force an interference, they wish to see how long they
can keep on squeezing before the divine judgement comes.They have chosen a side,
and they keep on attacking hoping to provoke a counterattack, which again will
lead to a process which will , ultimately, save them. Pat Buchanan is not trying
to destroy the world, he is trying to save it. Remember, the man was one of the
most wellread occultists in history when we met, and since then he has had acess
to all the structural calculations of the pyramid. He knows what he is doing.
What he is doing is trying to make the world come to an end.

That was were me & Lemmy disagreed with him. Lemmy meant that there was no need
to be that angry, pointing out that the fuckers had been in command for 1000
years, why not another thousand...?..Lemmy  always wanted just to ride & laugh &
fight & whore, and perhaps he was the one of us who had the point after all. He
was prone, in those philosophical moments under the full moon, to say things
about the inherent relationship between movement and beauty,about the importance
of the Wild Hunt. He was of the opinion that any construction of deliberate
thought was bound to stumble against some snatch, that the laws of hubris were
effective and absolute for any intentional magician. Lemmy was and is my hero,
and he is also still alive....Patrick went in on a hate-trip of such magnitude
that he might be in the position of possible sucess. Me,Eye am just sitting here
looking at the sun, with Eyes half-shut and my body in tatters from last nights
drinking and whoring. These are interesting times.

     ________________________________________________________________________
     
     OF WORK AND REINDEER

Anyone who has had to slaughter a reindeer in less than five minutes
knows that it is a hell of a job. The initial cut of the belly is
easy, and the letting out of the blood usually works fine, but the
cutting of the meat takes time and strength, and the professionals
usualy use a Black & Decker saw on the corpse itself. That sound
when you do it the old way, of the blade slicing through tissue and
hitting bone, is something that can make reverbations in a reflected
mans dreams, and make him consider what makes those cursed laps
throng around the country side chanting and drumming and not looking
after their livestock like they are bound to by the Law of
Wilderness, chapter 23 '11. And when one comes around a bend ,
riding hard and true and howling along to the lyrics of Ace of
Spades, one doesnt want to consider the possibility that cause and
effect will soon have one cutting meat in frantic haste while having
to look out for the herders of the flock of beasts one just ran full
speed ahead into. These laps can be dangerous, only last year they
killed three tourists and one longdistance driver, and whenever Eye
do dealings with them for Borealis-workings, Eye keep my shotgun
close. Wich they respect, as one crazy mother acknowledges another.

Wich reminds me of an argument Eye had some years ago with my old
friend Cameron and a french friend of his. We had been watching a
Canadian concert, this one man playing percussions, and we were
rather stoned and spaced out, and we got into arguing, like we
always do, about the intentions of different possibilities of
myth-making, and their implications upon the existing weave. Now
Cameron is a youngster, and he did not experience the sixties, only
the backlash, and for this Eye am willing to excuse him quite a
lot. Those who have only experienced recession are very rarely
capable of visualising the true surge, any concept of action gets a
fatalistic mood very easily these days. Also it is true that the
realms of technique are much easier and sortable, possible to
navigate, and the fact that Cameron and his friends are playing with
borrowed instruments naturally msakes them wary of their actions,
and unwilling to take mre than small snatches outta the body of
knowledge. They seem like nice people, this tribe, and it is perhaps
this that keeps on puzzling me. Because on one hand you have all
this rather reclusive but in general warm and kind people, able to
see themselves for what they are while they are it, on the other
hand Eye see these manipulated, pacified and spell bound servants of
servility, slaves of their own focus who not only has not considered
any options, but refuse to listen to any tauntings, who read chinese
poetry but refuses to answer the monkey calling names with Wisdom.
It is one thing to want to conquer the world, another to talk with
angels and a third to realise the spell-like consistence of
television.  It is one thing to become religious, another to let
different truths clash and observe the patterns of the fallout. This
me and Cameron have been fighting over for at least 6 years, and
odds are we will never agree. The mechanics seem to be holding the
visible ground these days, and for those of us who remember the
sensation of burning rubber with a head full of acid under the stars
in the middle of the Mojave desert they do seem a tad crude...
We , who used to write sigils for the skies with our dusttrails, who
used to do majik with a baseballbat and a head full of speed, we of
the tribe who never saw the need for Egyptian archetypes when there
was movies & tales and heroes to be found and deeds to be done, we
find it a little weird to see these hordes of young men without any
resonance crowding in on the corpse of the action, eager to tear off
a little piece of the mirage for themselves. We who have been
hitchhiking in Serbia and smiled into the barrel of a
foreign-speaking gun, we do not understand this fascination with
vasectomy that seems to be a repeating theme inside somany American
reverbations these days. Born to Die, Fight to Live, until you
understand the archetype of Lemmy you are nothing but mindwankers is
what Eye usually say to Cameron when he calls me at six in the
morning to complain about how he cant find any meaning with life.
These conversations often take an extrememly violent nature, the
sound of a grown man crying and jabbering about existensialism
always makes me wanna carve some meat, and Cameron knows this and
needs this counterreAction to stay alive. Problem with the aspect of
hopelessness is this junky-like addiction to constructs, and the
need to quench other possibilities but the chosen construct. Cameron
usually says something about realitystructures at this point of our
argument, about how the Hegelian structures imply an ending to
questions in order to have any impact in life, and Eye usually
mutter something about the Action of Choice and non-acceptance of
bullshit, and then we shut up for A couple of seconds. Cuz this is
the core.



When Eye was travelling in India, Eye met this little old man of the
Pan-Shri cult, wich Eye had never heard about. He talked English
quite O.K., so we got to talking, and we shared a meal and a
chillum. He looked at me with great smiling eyes, and we sat in
quiet and watched the sun go down over the trees and the reflections
caused on the water, and we listened to the absence of noise. When
the moon was well up, he spoke for the first time in some hours, and
told me to follow him. Making sure my machete was still with me, Eye
followed him him into the jungle through a path, weaving and
turning, until the whole forest seemed like a maze. In the end we
came into a clearing , where there was built a sort of halfroof in a
circular form, with an open circle in the middle. There were
smouldering coals lighting the scene, and perhaps two-hundred to
three-hundred people dancing in a weird kind of shuffle around the
middle of the circle. The old man stepped forth, and said a few
words in a loud clear voice, and as Eye came close to the circle Eye
was handed a bowl of something hot to drink, wich tasted like shit
but sure made my head work in new and fascinating ways. Much more
Eye do not choose to remember in public, but when Eye awoke two days
later, Eye found myself alone in the middle of the circle, sleeping
beside the focus of the whole dance. It was a cokemachine.

Eye tried to tell this to my good friend Olav once. His first
reaction was that these were stupid & puerile savages, incapable of
anything but the simplest cargo-cult tendncies and animism. There is
only one reading to a text, seems to be a paradigm in some circles,
and my good friend chose this one. Personally, as Eye have often
pointed out to my old chum, Eye see conversation as a piece of ass,
to be discovered again and again, to be treated like a fuck where
you sometimes go for the throat and sometimes for the stroke but
always always always, you look into the Eye of the partner, smiling.
We who have been in the battles in Rome and Berlin, who have
experienced the victory at Forte Prenestino, who have played with
the Italian dolphin-girls, who have seen the beauty of the
greenspace, we do not understand this clutching of self, and this
unwillingness to play.  As Leonard Cohen said it, in a rather drunk
moment while we were discussing bombing the World Trade center:  Bop
til you Drop . We who love the forest will never be able to Love the
City, no matter how much we understand its implications it will
always be an obstacle to us and our longing.

And saying this propably implies a visit from some of Lemmys friends
tomorrow, going to hurt me for joining the flowerfairies. These
Norwegian bikers are a hell of a strange crew, they are used to
wrestling with halfdamaged moose and reindeer, and as Eye look at
the blood under my nails and think about that one horrible moment up
in the mountains earlier today there is that certain feeling that
doom is on its way in the form of a 200 kilo bearded man full off
amphetamines and nicknamed the El Also, Eye get this feeling that
this is another excercise in futility, that to wake the serious
segments of society is about as easy as  winning the grail... Those
who would read this would never be able to get enough cohesion
together to do anything in coordination, what we need desperately
now is for Hells Angels International to reveal themselves as master
occultists and do the last charge of the Light Brigade in
coordinated movement with NSK and the Italian resistance. Imagine
it, lots of hard men wearing helmets and sunglasses just riding into
town, then getting off and forcing people with brute force and weird
lines of logic  to see and understand that Kapital is Enemy, TV is
Bad Voodoo and the World is under a Curse. That would be something
to sing of, but in the meantime the anglosaxon world will just have
to stay beneath the blade until it grows up enough to be able to
observe those who are cutting it. Eye hope the Laps come and get
them first, though. Theire knives are big, and they like to work in
the true light of the Aurora Borealis. These days, they also have
snowscooters, so there is no hope in running.

Babs attended the NutMeg, or NetMage conference last year.  This
gathering takes place in Chicago once a year and is a real life gathering 
of magicians, witches, warlocks, and the like who usually only meet on the 
Internet.  Davis did not attend, but has a strong telepathic link with
Babs since a tiamat rite last year.  

On her return they collaborated on the following document.

	STORY....

3-Atl-Z and Node*EN at Nutmeg


She finds herself lost out beyond the window of the plane as it finds its 
way on its course to Illinois even though her Will is in the middle of 
one of his stories that generally keep her occupied and focused.  But the 
clouds are web-like and sticky looking and seem to want to draw her out.  
The curiousity and the waiting have put her in such an odd mood that she 
is getting lost so easily; it is not an entirely bad feeling.  As she 
begins to float her eyes shut dreamily and a voice that seems to be 
generated from the web, from what seems to be out from beyond her own 
being, begins to think these strange images to her...

> And as you read this ... a memetic implant ...
> placed by our most skilled surgeons ... into a
> most vulnerable structure ... is stirred ...
> and begins ... to grow ... and to fold ... on
> itself ... a thought ... a seed ... folding ...
> and growing ... and taking root ... an oragami
> crane ... takes flight ... cutting and folding
> ... growing and rooting and flying our surgeons
> ... on itself ... the implant takes hold.

she is jolted awake, quickly glancing around.  No time seems to have 
passed and Will is continuing his story even as the plane approaches 
Midway, the smaller of the two main airports in Chicago.  She is wondering 
if there will be someone there to pick her up and help them find their 
way out to this hotel in the boon-docks of the city.  Waiting, watching 
for her turn to follow the line off the plane, she gets dizzy with red 
eyes...

> and a faint pulsing ... the blood ... and the
> eyes ... dilate and constrict ... to bright
> ... to dark ... slowly ungulating ... and folding

Finally we pull up to a lonely building with two small front windows that 
are barely lighted.  Looking closely, she sees what looks to be dismembered
babies in those windows, but as they get out of the car and get closer she 
realizes that they are dolls that are relatively intact.Inside, the polish 
polka music plays on the box, we order some drinks and wait some more. An 
eternity passes before we find the hotel and the day arrives when the others 
are supposed to show.  We can't be in Chicago, this city can't be this quiet 
and this suburban and this surreal.  There should be others around already. 
She wonders if she has come on the wrong weekend.  Good thing her Will is 
here to entertain her.

> becoming a cycle ... a cycle of cycles ...
> wandering ... and twisting ... like breathing 

People come, run into their hotel rooms and shut the doors.  There is an 
odd, quiet pall to this place than cannot be escaped.  There is food 
later, and a Vortex but she doesn't seem to be able to find any other 
energy but her own.  It doesn't exist. Not yet. The adolescent boys are 
wandering around in a daze occasionally asking if the orgy is about to 
begin. She rolls her eyes, and they go away. Later, things haven't 
changed, so she grabs Will and steals away to her own room to be 
entertained. 

> cycling ... folding ... unfolding ...
> breathing ... wandering ... the route
> integral ... consuming ...
 
On day 2, she follows the others to the park. It should be Wednesday, 
but it is not. Food comes and goes.  Someone mentions a spider rite, and 
finally a little color explodes on to her vision. Her eyes widen a bit 
and she askes, "spider?"  A subset of the group splits off to discuss the 
ritual.  She listens to someone read the theory behind this rite but most 
of it doesn't sink in very far. Xastur? who wrote these directions? 
Whatever... but the spider! She feels her already! She does remember 
hearing that the one who is possesed by the spider needs to be well 
grounded in their Will.  Good thing she brought hers with her. The others 
ask her "you wanna be the spider and tie everyone up and bite them?".  
She grins broadly... "of course". (She wonders if she should have been 
paying more attention to that theory discussion. "nah" she decides, 
"it'll be ok")  The group finds a place to work, and get the materials 
together. The one star in sight creates an lovely opening to the sounds 
of drum beats.  That makes her happy and dazed.  2 guys are going to help 
her prepare for the spider... she looks over at her Will in the middle of 
the space. She grins at him.  One guy wants to put some helmet on her 
head to 'help the her attune to the spider's frequency'. She laughs and 
thinks "ya, whatever helps this work for you...but the spider is already here
though, silly man!" and this other idiot has cut his hand and is throwing 
blood on her.  She throws a tiny bit of anger at him.  Finally these 2 
seem to stop doing what they need so she begins... proding the 4 and 
positioning them around the silver middle that contains the spider map.  
she ties them to various trees and to each other, slowly and happily 
growing in strength the whole time... the rope goes around his torso, his 
legs, her neck, her chest, her feet, his belly, his hands, his neck, her 
balled up body. She laughs and tugs on the strings here and there sending 
out currents... she dances to the drums beating (she wished they were 
faster)... how much time has passed? she vaguely wonders... she moves to 
the first, pushes him up against the tree and sinks her teeth into his 
shoulder... she giggles and drools giddy like and spits into the cup... 
very excited now she runs to each, chewing and biting, pushing and 
tugging... she isn't completly sure of what exactly is happening, the 
corn meal is kicked over, who is that new guy?, more biting, if i pull 
this rope it will choke her a little bit... once she moves close to her 
Will for strength... she has all the venom she needs and is just playing 
now, running from one to the other she stops, waits...the rope is gone 
now, and she is feeding them bananas, she laughs while doing that... they 
sit around the silver, and shred the map and she laughs with at least one 
other. There is one left who hasn't shaken the venom yet and that one 
crawls and groans.  She is lit, her eyes shine, and she finds herself 
engulfed by the spider who is in turn limited by her form.  We are 
divisions of each other, as are all things web-like.  She/spider laughs 
as she begins to think/say...

The plane begins to descend she finds herself, though still frustrated, 
filled by the spider.  Her energy and strength are increased and still 
quite bright.  She sees the spider on her web... the form is gossimer, 
glassy but she knows it is unbreakable and flexable... strands spread out 
as far as she can see connected to all and intertwined amongst themselves
... she giggles as she imagines which thread she will pull next 
and the voices begin their quiet chatter...

MAKING THE COMPUTER WITH TWO BACKS

Feeling alone on Valentine's Day?  Then what you need is some impersonal,
cold computer sex.  Yes, now you too can heave and sweat like some potbellied
unix weenie but with a difference!  Magick!  Cybermagick!

Purpose:  To make oneself feel much closer to your computer.  To express that
forbidden love between carbon and silicon.

Intent:  To achieve one-ness with one's own computer.  For your mind to send
emotion into your computer, making it feel emotion or just feel depending on
how you feel, and to experience the logic of your computer (or fuzzy logic if
you're using Pentium.  Remember, they didn't call it the 586 because the chip
would call itself the 565.998871)

WHATCHA NEED

1  a screw
2  a screwdriver
3  a doughnut
4  genitals
5  a comfy chair
6  a jack to connect your wetware to your hardware, it could be a rigger
device (most complicated) to just a consecrated string running betwixt you
and the computer (simplest).
a computer
7  IRC or comparable chatrooms
8  relative privacy

WHATCHA GONNA DO

Attach the rigging device (#6) to an area of the body you feel would
 interface most discreetly, yet easily with the computer.  Say, around thine
wrist so your pulse may send mana into the computer and the computer can
reciprocate with it's aethyr.  Hook up the rigging device to the computer
where thee deem it most compatible.

Find thineself a comfy chair (#5) for thee to park yer carcass

Makke sure thee hast found a place of privacy (#8), so none shall interrupt
thine work and make you feel silly doing this at your age (shame on you!  :)

Log on to your favorite spicy area of the digital aethyr (#7), seeketh not
for the unzesty, seek only that may call to your baser instincts.  All the
while, cooing sweet nothings into your computer's disk drive.  Begin the
work, finding something that is spicy beyond spicy, zesty above and beyond
the call of duty of zesty.

Unto thineself, commit the sin of St. Onan (He Who shall Take Things into His
own Hand).  Use of Power Tools would be recommended, but unnecessary.  Thee
canst also bringeth with thee for the same purpose a significant other, be
they female, male or porcupine.  Continue until thine dost reach the point of
no return, the point where some parents said "whoops" and had to get married.

Immediately!  Take the screw (#1) and screw it into the computer, anywhere!
 Into the tower, the monitor, as long as it goes into the computer.  Phillips
head (#2) works better than flat head (#2) in earlier attempts.  If thee hast
un partner in this working, have them screw the screw in.

Lean back and let the cultural exchange betwixt silicon based intelligence
and wetware begin.  Feel the computer growing a heart, filling with heat that
you direct into it.  Close your eyes and let your mind be filled with nothing
except multiplication tables.  Let them grow exponentially until your mind is
filled with numbers and logic.  There will be a point where thee will findeth
true union and understanding betwixt both entities.

Just make sure you used the antivirus on the computer.  Black Ice is hell.

BANISH
if you deem it necessary, perhaps a grounding would be more in order.  Then
consume the doughnut (#3) or just smoke a Camel.
There you go, a pleasant little ritual for this season of love and chocolate.

Kinesthetic Magick, by MAZE 

Chapter 2            

                        - The Sensation -


I start with the premise that each person wants to experience both
itself and the matrix more fully. By doing so, it attracts and
creates far better (more intense) sensations for itself. The 
difference between attracting and creating sensations are 
typified in an ancient Chinese symbol most people are familiar
with, the yin-yang. To experience the difference involves a
meditation. The experience is kinesthetic, which means you feel
it, and what's more: you feel it within yourself. 

Most meditations involve either visualisations or feeling outside
of yourself, such as watching or feeling your breath. The 
nose is a long way from centre, and we are feeling inwards. All
meditations are valid to the people of the matrix, some have more
intense sensations around them, some give us what we are questing
for, whereas most don't. If you wish to feel the difference between
yin energy and yang energy do this meditation. I'll explain the
difference more fully shortly.

Preparation:

    - This is the same for both meditations and is a fairly common
      meditation in itself.

Sit with your back straight, perhaps on a chair as I prefer, or else
on the floor, or perhaps lay down and start by taking a few slow
deliberate breaths and close your eyes.

Allow your consciousness to roam freely within your body, settling 
eventually in your toes. Focus on the feeling within your toes and
feel the space within your toes. Move to the sole of your foot leaving
just the shell of your toes, i.e. your toes are empty space. Move
your consciousness upward within your body: toes, soles, feet, heels,
ankles, calfs, shins, knees, thighs, buttocks, anus, sexual organs,
hips, kidneys, stomach, inner body, lungs, heart, slowly up the
spine, throat. Then along the arms, doing each finger one at a time,
hands, wrists, fore-arms, elbows, biceps & upper arms, armpits, 
shoulders, nape, neck, chin, mouth & tongue, nose, eyes, third eye,
ears, back of head, top of head then inside head. 

I've found it useful spending 10-15 minutes emptying the body/feeling 
the space until the whole body is felt to be empty space.

The consciousness is then directed to the centre of your body, let
your consciousness sit quietly centred for a short time, surrounded
by the shell. The heart region is the centre of the body for the
purposes of this and the following meditations and is called the
heart chakra, in Eastern texts.

Yin:                                                          
Once you are centred to your own satisfaction, that is, your 
consciousness is at the heart chakra:
                let go of the shell 
which is to say
                fall through the shell. 
                
The feeling you'll have is of falling and the energy is yin. 

There is a point where consciousness says "hang on!" and you climb
back up. You then need to create the space within your body again,
though it can be done much more rapidly as you deem fit. Centre 
yourself again and drop again. Note the feelings you get, but avoid
intellectualising just yet. This isn't head-stuff. These are physical
energies your learning how to experience.

Yang:
To best feel the difference between Yin and Yang, follow straight
on from the Yin meditation once the feelings have been noted. On 
alternate meditations, start with the Yang then follow with the Yin.

Centre yourself again, placing consciousness at heart chakra, then
direct your consciousness now to your innards as you breath. Trace
a mental circle within your body starting below the navel, 
breathing in: tracing around to the top of the lungs then 
breath out: tracing the circle down the other side within yourself. 

Get a good circle within yourself. 

Once you've got the circle happening within yourself, feel the sensation 
you have at the upper and lower points of the circle, that is, between 
breathing in and breathing out. Feel the Yang at these two peaks within 
each cycle.

Chi:
It took me 3 attempts at this meditation before I felt the difference
so persevere if the results aren't felt first go. After 6 attempts or so,
the difference between Yin and Yang energies becomes blatantly obvious
and I can feel the difference now, as easily as I can feel the keyboard 
under my fingers. The combination of Yin and Yang energies results in
the basic substance of life, Chi, which goes under various names. In
English it is best described as the LifeForce, or just the Force for
2 reasons: 
          - It encompasses death.
          - I'm a fan of Star Wars.

Before continuing with more techniques, I'll explain the difference
as a combination of what I've read and of what I've felt. These 2
energies have different charges. I'll join the consensus by
calling Yang "positive" and Yin "negative". Yang is a creative energy,
a potential; Yin is a passive energy, a void to be filled. Yang is 
described as male and Yin as female. I feel these descriptions as 
inaccurate and wonder where they originated. Perhaps the social 
standing of women at the time, being more passive, caused these
descriptions. More likely, it has to do with the physical qualities
of women and men. The sexual organs are manifestations of Yin and
Yang. However, the sexual difference between Yin and Yang energies
is not relevant today. Women and Men have equal access to Yin and
Yang energies. I know I do.

The Taoists describe the first manifestations of Yin as the Moon
(Thai Yin) and of Yang, the Sun (Thai Yang). [Almost?] all 
mythologies describe the Sun as masculine and the Moon as 
feminine, assumingly because the Sun was active and the moon
was passive. I agree that calling the Sun Yang; and the 
Moon Yin is more accurate that the sexual descriptions of these 
space bodies.
I am talking about energy, and access to energy here.
                                                     
The energy spurned by the combination of Yin and Yang, results with Chi. 
This is far more easy to experience than the two as separate entities.
Simply, sit still and upright with your hands about 2 feet apart palms
facing each other. Put your consciousness between your hands (feel what
is there) and slowly bring your hands together until you feel the 
barrier between them (about 3-6 inches apart for starters). This is Chi
energy that you can feel. If you have troubles with this, rub your 
hands together deliberately and try again. I have no doubt that you
will feel this. Many people can see it too, usually it is of an electric
blue colour or else [as I do] a golden sphere, though to date I don't 
know the difference. Often visualising the golden sphere helps in
bringing the energy to your fingertips. Visualize one of the 2 colours
as you deem fit, but not white, as many books and teachers recommend.
White is Pure Yang energy, and the quest for enlightenment needs to
be balanced with the quest for endarkenment if it's quested at all,
in my honest opinion. 

Let me explain how I define some terms: 

Enlightenment is the attainment of a pure Yang energy. The enlightened
direct what they are doing, and know where they are going, and how 
to get there. The enlightened usually arrive where they are Heading.
The energy is one of potential, of movement, of creativity. It is the
active force in the matrix.

Endarkenment is the attainment of a pure Yin energy. The endarkened
finds something to do, and knows how to [literally] ride the flows
of energy in the matrix. There is a powerful intuition attainable
with endarkenment. The energy is one of acceptance, of being moved,
of inspiration. It is the passive force in the matrix.

Based on these definitions, neither can be labelled "Good" or "Evil",
nor can they be labelled "Masculine" or "Feminine", but labels and 
definitions vary widely in the spiritual communities. I base my
definitions on my experience. Your experiences may be different.

An example may help to illustrate, that of a painter.

Painter Yang, has an idea, gets the necessary equipment, and paints
with a great deal of passion producing a masterpiece.

Painter Yin, has an idea, gets the necessary equipment, and relaxes.
Yin lets the art be it's own inspiration and produces a 
masterpiece.

It remains to be seen what Painter YinYang, aka Painter Chi, can do.

So, you've now created an energy sphere in your hands. This can be
quite potent, yet there is more power available elsewhere. Put your
palms flat on your thighs and re-enter the empty space within your
whole body. Instead of generating the Force within your hands, you
generate it at the heart centre, and have your centre of consciousness
there. It's a little harder to get started with this energy, primarily
due to us always using our hands, and never spending much time feeling
our hearts. Once it is felt (connected with consciously), the power
raises many times over. Also note if you can feel that the energy from 
heart centre is different to the energies of the hands, and different
parts of the body. Accurately, the higher on the body you stimulate
energy within, the higher the frequency of the energy. A common 
mistake is to believe that higher = better. There is a whole science
of the different parts of the body and their energies, which deserves 
it's own later section. Known as chakras, Naomi Ozaniec writes:

        "The spinal network of energies is a vital part of the subtle
         anatomy of the human individual. The chakras are strung upon 
         the inner column of sushumna [the spinal meridian] like jewels 
         on a necklace. It is this central column which unifies the 
         separated chakras into a whole. It is possible for high levels 
         of energy to rise up from the base chakra through the spinal 
         nadi [meridian] and dramatically affect all the chakras 
         simultaneously."[1]

in her discussion on the raising of the Kundalini Force up the chakra
network. The chakras, are more than that. The are matrices within
the body. Each has it's own energy, each can be felt. There is a
ritual called the Middle Pillar, published by various authors. This
ritual is calling the energy downwards. If you are a student of 
rituals such as this, experiment with going upwards and note the
difference in energies available.

If you have experienced your own energy to some degree of definite
success, you may desire to enter a group structure.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TAZ:

When nodes (yang centres) form within the matrix for periods of time, 
we have a thing called a Temporary Autonomous Zone[2], or TAZ. The 
TAZ may desire (or otherwise) to formulate itself, or grow in strength. 
The mere coming together has the TAZ potential, so it wants to empower the 
links, and forget temporarily that the individuals have external links, 
or ignore them, thus becoming a TAZ.

To start with an exercise in which all units of then TAZ are in the 
same location. The TAZ should physically formulate itself into
a geometric layout. If 2 units, they face each other. If 3, they
form a triangle and so on. This is a simple exercise with many 
variations worth experimenting with. I list some of the possibilities
at the end of the section.

Each member of the TAZ enters quiet meditation and centres itself 
to the heart chakra. Each member puts it's own hands together until 
it can feel the Force contained therein. Once it is felt the TAZ forms 
smaller groups of 2 (becoming a 2 person TAZ within) and face their 
palms towards each other, exchanging the Force until an energy ball of 
some definite magnitude is felt. If they were then to move the energy 
ball around somewhat, they would be able to discover it's boundaries. 
This can be done by stretching, raising, lowering, squashing, etc. 
Become familiar with the Force your partner has. I've found that to 
touch hands is detrimental to the practise.

Now, if there is more than 2 of you, swap partners and do the same,
with some rotations within the TAZ, you will be able to feel the
difference with the Force of different members (and different TAZs). 
The sensations inspired great joy, when I first experienced this. 
I had always understood intellectually that each person has a unique
energy field. Having done this, I felt it.

You can do similar exercises with your eyes. Again form groups of 2.
The first unit has it's eyes closed, the second has them
open and looks/stares/watches one of the first's eyes. The first  
has to determine which of it's eyes is being looked into
via directing attention first to one then the other then back and so
on until the other's Force is felt. For the visual amongst you, 
when directing attention to each eye, see which one grows brighter.

You will by this stage be able to feel your partner's unique Force,
and in a group you can experiment by blind-folding one unit and 
taking turns at the Force balls within the hands. The results are
surprising, in that you are now able to know who you are playing 
with. All this in one evening.

With some rotation, you will have felt each other's Force and know
the difference between various TAZ members. Now, the TAZ has formed an
egregore, a group consciousness, or group Force, which may be
further strengthened by ritual [to be discussed in full in a later 
section] or by forming a pattern. Say there's four units, Each 
takes a quarter of the circle you exist in, and directs their own
Force to the centre of the circle, feeling the Egregore grow in
intensity, until the force comes back to their hands. By now moving 
forward, and compressing the ball, you have a very potent energy
that you may use for various purposes. If the purpose is to
formulate/strengthen the TAZ egregore, name the Force, spin it within
it's boundaries, perhaps chant mantra that seems appropriate
to the TAZ purpose, then absorb it back into yourselves. You are now 
inextricably linked to the Egregore. The consequences, both positive
and negative, are best discussed before commencing. In the matrix, 
it's all flows and exchanges of energy, nothing more, nothing less. 

To label the consequences positive or negative (whatever they may be) 
is accurate on a level I'm not currently discussing, though I work and
play on that level too.

I said I would discuss some further possibilities. In a short space
of time, you will be able to feel when a TAZ unit is nearby,
and by 'feeling out' or deliberately sensing, you will be aware of
the current emotional and spiritual state of the unit. Note that we
already have this ability, we have to learn how to tune into it. A
common example is directing our attention to feel the ground beneath 
our feet (or shoes as the case may be). We weren't paying attention 
to it before, but don't be silly in denying it's existence. With the 
Force, you have to learn how to pay attention to it.

Other TAZ Exercises:
  - Obtain a collection of items, such as a deck of Tarot Cards, 
    and have one member of the TAZ be the 'guesser'. A sample of
    cards are laid out (say 5 the first time) and all other 
    TAZ members direct their attention and send their Force onto
    that card, whilst the guesser is out of view. When done to
    satisfaction, the guesser comes in, and feels the cards energies,
    without touching, until the guesser can determine which of the 
    cards contains the TAZ energy.
    
    Note, many units within the matrix work well on a visual system,
    that is to say, they may be able to see the Force of the card
    immediately. Still, they should attempt to feel it, for this
    system is based on exploring kinesthetic magick. 

  - Healing. A member of the TAZ has some ailment. For example, I
    sprang my elbow while juggling. A member in full Health was 
    told, in experiment, that I had a damaged arm. She moved her
    hand up and down my arm, about 3 inches away, feeling my force
    radiate from my arm. She felt a slight disturbance in my force,
    which was described in analogy as a log fallen across a river.
    The method for healing is to smooth out the energy by slowly
    brushing along the river over the log, until the log seems to
    have vanished (to the brusher's satisfaction). Expect to be
    healed within an hour. With long term ailments (such as cancer)
    continue to do this as often as possible, even a few time a day.
    It's been reported to me by a long-term shaman of kinesthetic
    magick, that results vary from 80 - 90 % success, a lot better
    than any doctor. A little sad, if your in the 10%.
    
    Note, after doing such a healing, it is important for the 
    healer to ground or earth the energies that have been picked up.
    This is done by touching the Earth with the hands and sending it
    out, or by bathing in salt-water. A simple flick of the wrists
    will send it out a lot of the time. You will be able to feel the
    difference with only a little practise. It feels different. 
    Different temperature, different vibration, different level of
    comfort. A favourite way of Earthing, which is much looked down
    upon within the magickal community, is by hugging a tree.

It is important to note that people may come together for shorter 
periods of time than discussed, say a single session. The may only 
meet once in their lives. They too, may do any of these exercises. 
Recommended is the Force ball and getting accustomed to each other's 
Force.

Energy:         There are many different energies that are 
                perceivable. It is defined as that which is
                perceivable, and can be controlled and directed
                for specific means. This essay deals with
                perceiving, controlling, and directing using
                kinesthetic means.

Force:          The Force is the name popularized by the Star
                Wars movie trilogy, for the energy that abounds
                in the cosmic matrix. Same as Chi.

Kinesthetic:    To do with the sensation of touch.

Mantra:         A series of syllables, often repeated, that
                may be spoken inwardly or outwardly designed

                like spider webs, or like whirl-pools. 
                Each matrix consists of smaller nodes 
                which are also matrices, and each is part
                of greater matrices. The Matrix is also
                the name given to all matrices, which is
                colloquially called The Cosmos. More 
                details forthcoming in Chapter 1.

Node:           A node is a centre of activity. It is a 
                potent yang energy, active and creative.
                Between nodes is the space, which is
                yin energy.

TAZ:            Temporary Autonomous Zone.

Visual:         Pertaining to the sense of vision, or seeing.

  Node BBZ
  
  is composed of three members Tzimon Yliaster, his partner Hine Nui Te Po, and
  their child Cypress.  Of the node, Tzimon says:
  
 "So, we're now BBZ Broadcasting, Inc., the *only* magickal cabal headed by 
a two year old!  There are three members, and we meet daily from 7 AM 
until 8 PM.  Our current main focus is 'children and Chaos Magick'."

  Tzimon has been a major influence on the development of Chaos Magick on the 
  net, founding alt.magick.chaos and the tiamat mailing list.
  
  Currently Tzimon is working with an entity known as Lolotehe, a spider 
  goddess.  Tzimon has created a temple to Lolotehe on the DivWeb, directions 
  to which follow his article.  In this text based tinymuck Tzimon has created
  an elegant and sinister environment that is well worth the minimal effort it
  takes to visit.

Lolotehe

Prologue & Invocation

>From out of the darkness and out of the light I call you, come
From within myself and without myself I call you, come
From a place that is not a place to a place that is not a place I call you,come
From a time that is not a time to a time that is not a time I call you, come
I offer myself that you offer yourself
Lady of the Endless Web, World-Weaver
I have nothing that is not yours
Eight-Legged, Fly-Consuming
Embodiment of the Octave
With our laughter we banish the distance
Nor can time pass
Nor do events occur
This is the center of the horizon
With our laughter we banish the signs
Nor can there be guards
Nor may sphinxes bar the gate
This is the horizon's center
I have bound us with our blood and sweet perfume
With my left hand I touch the World of Light
And with my right the Sphere of Darkness
My feet stand upon Alpha and Omega
From my heart springs a squared cross
My head is thrust in the space between

Here is Our Lady of the Endless Web, her web touching the face of an Abyss.
On the one side all things are dispersed, and on the other, manifested. The
Web itself is infinite in every direction, changing beyond the borders. This
is paradox, and it is in this paradox that all things find a unification
upon the Web. The Web is the collection of the Intersection ofPossibilities. 
Where the threads embrace, a Thing is created. Where it issundered, No-Thing.

The Last Dream

I am entangled, entrapped in something.
I can't even struggle, I'm so tightly woven in.
My mind is also enmeshed, and reels with every sensation describable.
None of it makes sense; I will go mad, I will lose myself.
Light and dark flicker, first one and then the other, in every gradation,
brilliant flashes and pitch blackness, randomly.
Out of this confusion resolves Lolotehe;
She is black and red, her hair bristles, she has five eyes like gems.
Her six arms move furiously, weaving and rending the web between her
hands before her eight breasts.
Her body blends woman and spider seamlessly.
She is in constant motion; she seems part of the web, but moves freely.
I focus on her and find myself again, I anchor my mind to her.
From the web she weaves a sigil, from the formlessness a glyph.
I don't understand this sigil.
It's an empty sign to me, meaning nothing.
I have seen it; that is enough.
I awaken.

The dream stays with me throughout the day; the sigil seems burned into my
mind. I can't forget it even as I write a letter to someone I've never met
before. I've found a rare book he wrote years ago, and I want to ask him
about it. I want to make it available again; it was so good, I want to give
it away.

Two days go by; I get a reply from the author. He gives his permission to
republish the book and wants nothing in return. He has drawn the first sigil
on his reply, in black ink. His letter resembles a work of art, with
drawings and a card reading "Join the Chinese Army". This makes no sense to
me. Perhaps that's the point.

The Web

"The meaning of this is unimportant," she tells me,
"It is a mark, a sign.
It need not signify anything for now.
You are awake, that's enough.
All that is needed are eyes and hands;
there is dream and there is action.
When they both are,
with this all things are possible."
Look, here is my web."

And then I see the web, I see what it is.

It is this:

This is the unit, the block.
It is replicated before my eyes a million million times.
The node is the access, around it all things revolve.
This is the most manifested.
Each node is connected by its path to another;
The path is the least manifested.
Where the angles touch, another node is formed,
but these are a different manifestation.
That is, they are that which comes closer to the nodes,
and thus they are manifested in relation to the nodes, have less potential
than the paths.
The partial path within are that which awaits unity with the node, it is not
fully manifested.
Each node is surrounded by a sphere, like a jewel, transparent and gem-like.
This is the horizon, all that can be known from the node;
it is through this globe the node sees the manifested.
The globes all touch one another.
Their compounding so creates a glittering haze,
so that the nodes can be seen as a gray smudge.
All the nodes are like flies, buzzing within the spheres,
disconnected yet bound together.
Through their haze they glimpse each other,
but there is a distortion, and this creates the paths.
Within them and without each unit is nothing, neither black nor white.

"Touch my web and the strings all bend."

I pluck up a thread and many units move;
the spheres slide around each other, and all the paths and diamonds
rearrange.

She weaves as I do, adding threads and rending threads.

I strain to see a pattern and can't; still the weaving is.

"To create motion, a place apart is required,
a place of leverage, a place to stand.
All who would use this must first learn to stand upon nothing.
No ground can support them.
To move my web, one must first stand away from it.
The place is paradox, where there are paths but not nodes,
which is also within the diamonds.
Wakefulness is all;
as I never cease my weaving,
none cease theirs.
The weaver is the web. how, then, shall my web weave itself?
Yet I do weave, as do you.
I tell you that you must accept the life of the impossible before you can
affect what might be, and you must affect what might be before you can touch
what it.
I see ants and men all devoid of intellect, empty of mind.
They move the web by simple rules; like robots stacking cordwood they go.
Globe touches globe after globe,
but the nodes are always separated.
Thus they weave, unaware of paths and diamonds,
with threads bent as consequence but not as effect;
there is no intention of bending them.
Remember all this when the Dark releases you;
It is your place-holder.
The node insures return.

Caution

You will come before those who say that they are guards.
They are wrong though they believe themselves.
A word or sign will dispel them from your choice.
Mark these nodes well in your memory;
as my weaving goes on, theirs will be sundered,
and others may sunder it as well.
You will find they that say to beware my children;
they but see their own slight reflection from within their own sphere.
I have no children save what I weave,
and even these I don't tend.
There are no guards, likewise, but those reflected by others.
These guards are the web, and the web is being woven.
They are limited, as are all nodes, experiencing as they do but one thing at
a time.
Upon the web their influence is nothing, as is yours;
but they can't step from it, or they will fall forever and burn like comets.
Here is the sign of dispelling:
Place this sign on nothing woven unless to un-weave it.
It increases potential and unmakes the manifest.
Never touch yourself with it upon the web, or there will be no returning to
the node.
The is the sign of entrance into nothing, into between-ness.
I raise that which is beneath above, and even then tear it back down.
If you blink, you'll miss the change.
The color that your eye gives is real, but potential.
Nothing is not, and what is not is only so for lack of potential to become,
which is nothing of itself, and devours itself forever.
It can't affect my web, but do not think that nothing is nothing.
Nothing is that which awaits, but does so without attributes.
It is neither with a thing, nor separated from it."

********************************************************************************
The Solo Node of Jaq D. Hawkins.

Jaq D. Hawkins, under her other pen name Markie Chao, wrote "Defining Chaos",
a document I found on nic.funet.fi.  I was so impressed with the document 
that I included it in ZChronicles1.1, and in the hard copy gave it top 
billing.  In the latest printing of the ZChronicles1.1, in fact, it precedes
my own article on Chaos Magick-Magickal Terrorism.

I received a letter from a woman in England expressing interest in what the 
Z(Cluster) was doing, as a result, I believe, of a kind article in Gnosis.
I sent her a copy of the Zchronicles1.1.  She wrote back to me telling me 
that she was, in fact Markie Chao, the author of the article and was surprised
and delighted to discover that it had been reprinted.  I, of course, was 
even more delighted to have contacted this fine author by shamelessly (and
without even asking permission) reprinting her work.  

Jaq D. Hawkins, who is still living in England, is one of our few nodes that
are offline.  She sent the following fine piece for inclusion in ZKron2.

INITIATIONS, MEMBERSHIPS, AND OTHER GAMES THAT PEOPLE PLAY

by Jaq D. Hawkins

Once upon a time, at about the age of ten, I thought that being a member of a
secret magical society would be a grand thing indeed.  I knew of such things
then, but little actually about them.  It was the  mystery and my child's ego
which found fascination in the idea of being a member of something which not
just anyone had access to.

Many years passed, and my magickal knowledge and experience grew with my
maturity.  I learned about initiations and degree systems, even participated in
more than one, and as an adult practising magic with other adults, observed an
attitude in some of those other adults which very closely resembled my childhood
fascination for membership and degrees.  I had obsevrved a social structure, a
basic need for people to "belong" to something and  in some cases, to achieve
reognition wiithin their chosen social structure.

This was all very fascinating from a sociological point of view, but a bit
disheartening in other ways.  It seemed that many people deemed by their
"degrees" to be the great and wise among occult groups were all too frequently
rather ordinary people who had managed to achieve their goal, the degree.  This
is not to say that nobody who attains a high degree within a system might have
got it through hard work and personal transformation, but all too often, it
appears ( in my observations) that the degree ranking itself has been the goal
rather than the personal transformation which is supposed to be involved.


This all sounds rather cynical.  Who am I to judge the spirituality or magical
ability of others?  Well, no one really. I simply observe these things because I
have been through the usual though processes that most occultists go through at
some point in their growth where they try to define themsleves.  It is my own
attempts to define my magical goals which have led me to examine existing groups
of all sorts and the potential purpose of joining one,  The end result of the
process is that I think of  myself as a solo Chaos Magician.  The reason behind
that is that I find myself uninterested in artificial hierarhchies or dogmatic
rules about how I shoulds conduct my rituals.  I have matured a bit since the
age of ten.

Explaining this in this way may well piss off a lot of people.  My words could
easily be interepreted in such a way that many would think I have just dismissed
the efforts of all magic users who belong to any sort of system.  Not so.  These
systems do serve a purpose , and I certainly recognize the value of them.  Like
anyone, I am drawn to the possibility of aligning myself with like-minded people
and continue to look into any new groups or systems that come along. That is why
I have aligned myself with the Z(Cluster).  It seems that I have run across some
of my own species.  After all, it would be too pretentious to walk around saying
that I am "in tune with the Zos Kia Cultus", now wouldn't it?

Meanwhile,the artificial hierarchies continue to take themselves very seriously.
I once accused a woman on a bbs of waving her pompoms for her chosen ceremonial
magic group.  Well, that's exactly what she was doing.  She was at a beginning
grade and going through the "if you're not part of our group, you ain't shit"
phase.  And this is a grown woman!  I came across a similar attitude from the
American faction of a well known Chaos Magic group when I gave a passing thought
to joining. It put me right off.  I've been practicing magic most of my life and
these people are telling me that none of it is valid until I join their group?
One would think that such an attitude would stay with the Baptists and Jehovah's
Witnesses where it belongs, but it is rampant in the occult world.

You see, it isn't the groups I object to. It's the attitude.  I recently said to
someone dear to me that the only thing wrong with Wicca was the Wiccans.  This
was based on a conversation wherein he had offered me second degree initiation
and my inclination was to turn it down.  The offer was sparked by some
back-biting and bitchcraft among what I call(to myself) the "nouveau initiates",
those who can trace their initiatory lineage back to Gerald Gardner (or Alex
Saunders). The odd thing about the Gardnerians is that many of them dogmatically
practice ritual by Gerald Gardner's methods and will defend those methods to the
bitter end, yet will express uncomplimentary opinions about the man himself.
Denigrate thy messiah but do your rituals according to His formulae.  I am told
that Gardner's Book of Shadows includes bits of thinking for oneself,rather like
Austin Osman Spare, but the dogmatists seem to have missed that part.

The exact same attitude is observable in some Chaos Magicians.  Do it as Spare
did, even if you exphixiate yourself, but always remember to think for yourself
("Yes yes" they cried to Brian in unison, "We must all think for ourselves!")
Interestingly, some of the"older"witches I have met here in England who learned
from systems which predate Gardner and Saunders have discussed methods with me
which sound rather like Spare, who was taught by a witch of unknown origins.

In fairness, I must admit that I have accepted a first degree Gardnerian Wicca
initiation here in England.  This was in order to give the religion itself a
chance, partly out of love for my Wiccan husband,and despite my experiences with
Wicca groups in America where I encountered quite a lot of ego and control-based
groups.  My American degrees are not recognized by the British initiates because
the origins of the initiators cannot be traced, but that is just as well as I
decided long ago that it was all a meaningless sham done by people with the
arrogance to think they had authority to award me validity.

Also in fairness,I must say that one valid argument has been made to me(again by
my Wiccan husband) for ritual to be performed in a similar way by a recognized
group, in this case the initiated Gardnerians.  The idea is that the common
practices give the system itself power, and that the initiates can tap into this
power by practising the same basic ritual formula.  This is a very valid concept
which is practiced by other groups as well.  Thelemites come to mind. Practicing
Crowley's rituals despite various opinions of the man himself is easily
comparable to this Gardnerian attitude.

Once again, the system breaks down shen the system becomes dogmatized.  There is
no room for growth or individuality when this happens.  Joining a group can mean
spiritual imprisonment rather than attainment, and it becomes a vehicle for
obtaining nothing more than a degree, a recognition for conformity.

It seems that human nature is the biggest enemy of human spiituality.As long as the need for companionship in our spirituality leads us into an artifical need
for recognition through degree systems, we leave ourselves open to stagnation &
false attainment goals. It is comparable to going to school to learn how to pass
exams.  Is it any wonder that the tarot trump IX, The Hermit, stands on his
mountain alone?
