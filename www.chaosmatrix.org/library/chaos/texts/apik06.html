<H2>SIGILS</H2>
<HR>

Sigilisation is a method by which a desire/intent is encoded into
a non-obvious form, i.e. a glyph or picture which does not immediately
call to mind the original intent. Any magical intent can be written
out, and the letters scrambled to form a picture, mantra or neologism,
which can be repeated or concentrated upon until gnosis ensues.
Alternatively, the sigil may be set aside until its original purpose
is forgotten, and then hurled.<P>

During gnosis or times of great emotional feeling, the sigil may
be drawn, visualised or fiercely concentrated upon, to the exclusion
of all else. This enables the so-called subconscious mind to 'reprogram'
reality in accordance with will. Once the sigil is cast, it is
forgotten, so that the desire's realization is not hindered by
'lust of result.'<P>

The word, spoken or written, forms the majority of sigils. It
is also worth experimenting with the keying of desires to specific
smells, tastes or sounds. Sigils can bring about a wide range
of results, from the most abstract to the 'mundane'. From altering
dream-content, to habit and behaviour reformation, and arranging
fortuitous co-incidences.<P>

Sigils may be formed in this manner independently of any system
of planetary or other symbols, and can be hurled forth without
elaborate ritual. As a method of practical magick, it is simple
and elegant; its effectiveness can be discovered through personal
experiment.<P>
