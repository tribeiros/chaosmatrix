<B>Subject:</B> On structural Sigilisation..<P>

This is a piece I've been thinkin of sendin to Chaos International, or
some other magazine. Any of your comments and crticisicms would be
appreciated.<P>

<HR><P>

Right. This is the main idea I've been fiddling around with the
lastyears. I'd like to point out that until recently, I have not read
any "Chaos" books except quite a lot of TOPY material, and that my
inspiration has been W.S.Burroughs & st.Gysin, my excellent Z-cluster
compatriots (approx 70 letters a day) and first and foremost my
practical comrades of the Origami RepubliKa who have allowed me to
fiddle about in my own little corner of that structure for quite a
few years now. A very special thanx goes out to O.S.Hagen, for giving me
such loving support and constructive critiscism.<P>

O.K., done with that. Lemme start of with a story: In 1995 I was
sitting in Victoria station in London, with a copy of 777 and
The Mystical Qabalah in my bag, waiting to get out of England. I had
just spent 1 1/2 weeks with the homeless in Brighton, I was depressed
and I had seen no sign that there were any constructive individuals
around, all of England seemed like a slagheap of either Selfcentered
eccentric majikians or drugged out hopeless travellers. I had expected
the home of the elderly TOPY, I had found nothing. So there I sat,
headed for Italy, when a man comes up to me and just quite simply
takes my hand and shakes it, declaring that his name was something
like Simon Fabolous, and could I do him a favour? I said a cautious yes,
whereupon he thrust a poster into my hands, and told me to put it up
somewhere else. I immediatly gave him my own little flyer, with its
printed message at the bottom "Put this somewhere strange". We smiled,
like fellow loonatics, shook hands again, and he was off into the
stream of people, continuing his little mission. The poster was a
xeroxed hand made thing, upon wich the legend was written: THE MOMENTOF
INTENSIVE THOUGHT BURNS HOLES IN THE FABRIC OF REALITY. I smiled all
the way to Dover.<P>

Over the last few years, Ive sortta developed my own little
meta-paradigm, what I call the Ka/Os approach to majik. It goes more or
less like this: Everything is in a state of motion, and that motion
is moving in patterns-of-being, what can be called Ka-patterns. Every
pattern is in a state of interrelationship to the patterns around it,
thus forming an Ocean of Ka-patterns. Just as the Ocean has natural
main currents, so has the Reality of Ka. this is what we call the Law
of Nature. The uniqueness of human beings is that we have the capacity
for observation and alteration of these patterns, this Act of breaking
with the state of things as they are I called Ki. This is the supreme
fear of man, the fact that it is responsible for its Actions and has
the theoretical possibility to be in complete freedom. I say
possibility, because here we touch upon the framework of the Word, wich
is where the complicated problems start. W.S.Burroughs, in his
"Electronic Revolution" has pointed out most of the pressing problems
concerning this structure of thought, but quickly summed up, it can be
brought down to the following: Every Act of conceptualisation involves
your whole structure, a new idea takes its place alongside the old
ones, replacing some, changing the order of arguments, but it is NOT
POSSIBLE to escape the inheritance of the moral, political and visual
implications of your linguistic structure. Your realitymachine is
hardwired by those in positions of power, from the archetypical level
and downwards. What Eckhardt sets forth as the dualised world, that
of conceptualised and experienced, is truth, and the one will
automatically transform the other as soon as the moment of Being has
passed.<P>

Right. Im a wordwanker, I know. Were getting to the practical
bits soon, but bear with me just a couple more secs. Burroughs sets out
as the requisite for any independent action that the individual must
retake the Reality studio of his own head, and he proposes the cut-
up technique to do so. And it is a very good technique, but for my
approach I was looking for something else, for a way to employ symbols
in a new and interesting manner. So I started fiddling around with the
concepts of Symbolic structures, to sigilise rituals down into
material so as to be able to use these as focuspoints for my majikal
attention. And I suppose this is where a lot of people will skip to the
next article, because my main idea with this has been to create a tool
with wich I am able to support my fellow comrades of the autonomous
scene in Europe and elsewhere. This I now believe I have found, and the
nice thing with it is that the possibilities for variation is almost
endless, while the theory remains constant. The point is, mainly,
to create a composite word, a word wich through its endless associative
structure escapes definitions and thus is free to be charged with the
exctacy of the moment of experience.<P>

The main idea is to create a structure of complexity. The
knowledge of complexity will lead to complex processes being employed
at the activation of the structure, even if the focus of the Act is
simple. Much of contemporary magiCK is about forcing the Will of
Self to bend the Will of nature, and this I have always found dis-
tasteful. Through creating a selfcontained structure of power, it is
my hope that the reverbance of that moment will on certain levels
influence other structures, at least those who are within the area
of the Action, wich is why Ive mostly been working within the Origami
RepubliKa with our performances. Another important point is that of
associated actions: If you have a concert wich you are going to
sigilize, you go out on the streets and put up small poems, pictures,
sigils, whatever, wich you then tie in to the main sigil event through
some associative theme. At the moment of gnosis/empowerment you
should have at least a threefold structure of complexity, and each of
these structures should stand in a relationship to each other, and
also be internally complex, thus forming a structure of priming for
the gnosis moment wich you can then focus on some simple Act.
Below I give an example, I dont think there is much use in flogging the
practical details much more. Id like to hear reactions & comments,
as long as they are not just questions.<P>

<H3>ORIGAMI BALLISTIKA: NEW BLOOD</H3>

Performed on the 4th of january, 1997, at Veita Scene. The performance
was to celebrate the release of Crashman aka K22 aka Ka-Z from jail,
after he had served a two month sentence for refusing the army. This
description of the ritual was originally posted on the z-list.<P>

Aim of Working: To create NRG around the performance, agressive & proud
NRG. Personal aim was to pull together knowledge from a few other Acts
into one whole.<P>

Material used:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 Power Mac w/ Quark Express.
<LI>1 Graphicprogram called KidPix.
<LI>22 Pieces of Cardboard.
<LI>3 sheets of paper.
<LI>Paint: Red, Green, Blue, Bronze metallic, Silver, White.
<LI>Dagger.
</UL><P>

Procedure: First I produced 22 simple pictograms, the KOMKOL logo
(Triangle with dot, upturned halfmoon crossing into. Fire/Water.) in
a circle. Black and white. These I NRGized in my makeshifttemple,
wich was on top of a crane in the rundown area of the harbour, and
then went around town in the middle of the night hanging them up
at angles to various posters for the concerts, preferrably so that
they would be caught subconsciously outta the corner of the Eye as
the individual saw the poster, or vice versa.<P>

Second, I printed out 22 VERY small frames with the words
WHY NOT? on them, one of our favourite slogans.<P>

Third, I started making the sijils themselves, using the
following procedure:First drew a Magen David, wich is a Jewish
traditional protective amulet. Painted over it green (Air). Drew
the sigil for ACTION.Painted over it bronze (earth). Painted a
black circlebounded by silver for focus. Painted over it blue (water)
Drew with a pen the four names of the Worlds around the edges,
the rune thorn in the middle, painted over it Red (fire). Drew my
own sijil on top of that, painted it white. This I made 22 of.
On each of these I then drew one symbol for the Tarot wich I have
from a very weird little danish book Ive got, "Tarot for Initiates".
This heap I then NRGized in my temple at night of full moon.<P>

At the venue, I strolled around putting the sijils in a semi-random
pattern , pulling them out of my pocket as I went so that the order
of the trumps would be random. I also put down the little WHY NOT?
signs on tables. As the performance started, I sat down in front of
the stage, and let my attention go from sigil to sigil while
concentrating on my friends performance. As the performance changed
rythm my strobing changed rythm.<P>

Result: My friend went through a full Katharsis, did one of his best
performances solo while in trance, smashed everything on stage and was
laughing the rest of the night, as was most of the audience afterwards.
Very good NRG.<P>
