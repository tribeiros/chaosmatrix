Oh come on now, all those kids and parents of the world feeding the
god-form of Santa psychic energy, love, affection and cookies in a
worldwide ritual every year...  who gives a damn bout the elves?  We
all know where the real money is, and every year he delivers, avatars
spread across the entire suburban hell of the San Gabriel Valley,
invoked in a ritual every Christmas eve, parents assuming the
quietness, swiftness and good will in a yearly sacred invocation.
Santa lives, whether invoked unconsciously by the parental magi or
not!
