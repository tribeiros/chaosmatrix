Whoa, the internet is a SCARRRRY tool sometimes...<P>

Scrambling franticly through the search engines, I found another bizarre
twist in the Jack Parsons story today. It seems that some folks think that
the Parsons/Hubbard/Crowley "Babalon Rite" somehow succeeded in opening a
portal to another "plane" (or more appropriately, dimension), and SOMETHING
came through (and is probably STILL coming through!). That something is
supposed to have been the source of the sudden jump in UFO sightings and
scientific development in the 1946-1948 period. Other interesting events
that happened in that period included the discovery of LSD, the Roswell
incident, the invention of the transistor, the discovery of the Dead Sea
Scrolls, the sound barrier was broken, and Crowley's death.<P>

Also there is a fellow named Stanton T. Friedman, (who is a nuclear
physicist) who was supposedly the original researcher of the Roswell case
who ties into Parsons. Friedman's 14 years in the aerospace industry
includs work for General Electric, General Motors, Westinghouse
Astronuclear Laboratory, TRW Systems, and Aerojet-General Nucleonics
(Parson's company) on several classified projects. Friedman is also one of
the most vocal proponents of the existence of the "Majestic-12" project,
and claims to have been one of the original members of the MJ-12 team.<P>

Also, if you are familiar with Crowleys sketches of his personal
conjourations and "spirit guides", there is one he described as "a
foetus-like head with large, black almond shaped eyes". He called it "Lam".
It is a dead ringer for what UFOlogists today call "greys".<P>

LRON also talks about similar critters in his Scientology mythos, and
alludes to mankind receiving "help" from estra-terrestrial beings.<P>

So now we have a HUGE conspiracy, beginning with Uncle Al, Jack & Cameron,
and LRON all screwing around, conjouring holes in the space-time continuum,
and bringing forth aliens in flying saucers. These saucers spur the DOD
into action, thereby making Parsons a millionaire (and subsiquently, LRON
gets a piece of it too!). Crowley had previously masterminded a deal
between the US government and the Nazis called Operation Paperclip, wherein
dozens of ex-Nazi aerospace and genetic researchers are given asylum in the
USA after the war, for cooperation in our "Alien Technology Backwards
Engineering" program. Parson gets blown up in a mysterious explosion and
his wife leaves the country. LRON cruises the oceans in
multi-million-dollar ocean liners, the COS becomes one of the
fastest-growing Western religions, and the OTO becomes one of the main
forces in occult research and publishing in the US and England. All the
while, UFOlogists are chasing the Department of the Air Force on some UFO
coverup goose chase, when the whole time it's the Navy (after all, Crowley,
LRON and Parsons all had connections there, and Camerson worked for the
Navy during WWII in Washington DC)...<P>

So let me get this straight. The Eschaton has already been immanetized, the
gates are already open, and the "demons" (or angels, depending on your POV)
that are rushing into our Earthly plane are actually aliens?<P>

Cool...<P>

Bright Blessings, and watch the skies...<P>
