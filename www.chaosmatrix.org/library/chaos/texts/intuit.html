   PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN
   Peek behind the curtain (don't peek behind the curtain). Are you afraid
   of what you might find (an old man masturbating)?

   Throw away your magical textbooks. They won't really help you. Ditto
   for the candles, inscence, robes, wands, etc. What you really need is
   a frame of mind (not one drugs will necessarily get you).

   Think of the last time you really wanted something. To set a record for
   yourself, to change, to get something you thought was perhaps out of
   your reach. Remember the frame of mind you were in. The determination,
   the total concentration on that one goal, every fiber, every cell
   moving forwards to grasp it. THE WILL TO SUCCEED. Changing reality to
   conform to your will. This is what magic is.

   Using magic is an integral part of being human. You use it like you use
   your hands or any other part of your body. It's just that you have been
   taught to feel you need the trappings when all that is truly needed is
   the will.
