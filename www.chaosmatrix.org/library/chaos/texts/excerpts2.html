Chaos (Kia & Chaos Magic)
</H3>

<UL>
 <LI>That which is responsible for the origin and continued action of
 events. (Pg 28)
 <LI>...the force which adds increasing complexity to the universe by
 spawning structures which were not inherent to its component parts. (Pg 28)
 <LI>...the force which caused life to evolve itself out of the dust.
 (Pg 28)
 <LI>...is currently most concentrated in the human life force, or Kia,
 where it is... (Pg 28)
 <LI>...the source of consciousness. (Pg 28)
 <LI>...cannot be known directly. (Pg 29)
 <LI>[gets its name]...from the bizarre and indeterminate nature of the
 aetheric plane. (Pg 29)
 <LI>[we are]...centers of Kia or Chaos. (Pg 29)
 <LI>All ones thoughts, obsessions, and demons must be reabsorbed before
 Kia can become one with Chaos. (Pg 40)
 <LI>It is true that the mind must be finally surrendered as one enters
 fully into Chaos, but a complete and balanced psychocosm is more
 easily surrendered. (Pg 41)
 <LI>In beginning the great work of obtaining the knowledge and conversation
 [of our Holy Guardian Angel or Augoeides], the magician vows 'to interpret
 every manifestation of existence as a direct message from the infinite
 Chaos to himself personally.' (Pg 49)
 <LI>Space, time, mass, and energy originate from Chaos, have their being
 in Chaos, and through the agency of the aether are moved by Chaos in
 the multiple forms of existence. (Pg 52)
 <LI>What is a god but man wielding the force of Chaos?  To him nothing
 is true; everything is permitted. (Pg 52)
 <LI>Yet the Great Goddess Chaos will lend some of Her power to those who
 can become her favorites. (Pg 52)
 <LI>Chaos, the life force of the universe, is not human-hearted.  Therefore
 the wizard cannot be human-hearted when he seeks to tap the force of the
 universe.  He performs monstrous and arbitrary acts to loosen the hold of
 human limitations upon himself. (Pg 66)
 <LI>...out of Chaos arise the two prime forces of existence, the solve et
 coagula of existence.  The Light power and the Dark. (Pg 103)
 <LI>It is impossible to understand Chaos, because the understanding
 part of ourselves is built out of matter which mainly obeys the
 statistical form of causality.  Indeed, all our rational thinking
 is structured on the hypothesis that one causes another.
 It follows then that our thinking will never be able to appreciate
 the nature of consciousness of the universe as a whole because
 these are spontaneous, magical, and chaotic by nature....  The
 universe IS the thoughts of Chaos, if you like.  We may be able
 to understand the thoughts, but not the Chaos from which they
 arise.  Similarly, we may be accustomed to being conscious and
 exerting our will, but we shall never be able to form ideas of
 what these are. (Pg 153-154)
 <LI>The force which initiates and moves the universe [Chaos],
 and the force which lies at the center of consciousness [Kia],
 is whimsical and arbitrary, creating and destroying for no
 purpose beyond amusing Itself.  There is nothing spiritual or
 moralistic about Chaos or Kia.  We live in a universe where
 nothing is true, although some information may be useful for
 relative purposes. (Pg 154)
 <LI>...the animating force of the entire vast universe is Chaos.  It is
 the inexpressible pregnant Void from which manifest existence, order, and
 form arise.  Being omnipresent and non-dualistic, it is virtually
 imperceptible, inconceivable, and impossible to visualize... (Pg 157-158)
 <LI>However we choose to see it, the ultimate ground of being is utterly
 void to our understanding, impersonal and inhuman, whimsical and
 capricious and far too infinite and incomprehensible to be much use
 as a god to limited dualistic beings like ourselves. (Pg 157-158)
 <LI>The consciousness-force in us that appears as the root of
 will and perception can be called Kia.  This Kia has no form.
 Any form of innate divinely sanctioned motive that one may
 seem to have found in it is illusion.  It is this void at the center
 of one's being which is the real Holy Guardian Angel.  The psychic
 censor, on the other hand, is a material thing which protects the
 mind from magic and from being overwhelmed by the awesome
 strangeness of the psychic dimension which appears to us as chaos. (Pg 162)
 <LI>We cannot perceive Chaos directly, for it simultaneously contains
 the opposite to anything we might think it is.  We can, however,
 occasionally glimpse and make use of partially formed matter
 which has only probablistic and indeterministic existence.  This
 stuff we can call the aethers. (Pg 192)
 <LI>If it makes us feel any better we can call this Chaos, the Tao, or
 God, and imagine it to be benevolent and human-hearted.  There are
 two schools of thought in magic.  One considers the formative agent
 of the universe to be random and chaotic, and the other considers
 that it is a force of spiritual consciousness.  As they have only
 themselves on which to base their speculations, they are basically
 saying that their own natures are either random and chaotic or
 spiritually conscious. (Pg 192)

<UL>
 <LI>[calling]... very unlikely coincidences or unexpected events into
 existence by manipulating the aether. (Pg 31)
 <LI>The magician can only change something if he can 'match' the Chaos
 which is upholding the normal event. (Pg 55)
 <LI>Thus does the magician turn that aspect of Chaos which manifests as
 causality to his advantage, rather than oppose it. (Pg 56)
 <LI>The adept magician however will have so strengthened his spirit by
 magic that it is possible for him to carry [his personal Kia] over into
 a new body. (Pg 103)
 <LI>Magic is where science is actually heading. (Pg 111)
 <LI>It is for wizards to determine how that new [alternative] spirituality
 will manifest. (Pg 114)
 <LI>The methods of magic are remarkably uniform throughout history and
 across cultures.  It is time to unearth them and make them work.  Secondly,
 it is essential that what might be called a spirituality of magic is
 evolved. Magic must have its own flavor, its own worldview, and its own
 philosophy. There has been a tendency to regard magic as an antique art.
 (Pg 114)
 <LI>Magic is aligning itself against oppressive forms of order in many
 fields. (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>Magic is opposed to psychiatry and medicine designed to patch up the
 damaged automaton and plug him back into the system.  Instead it would
 rather that individuals learn to handle their own mental self-defense
 and treat bodies with gentler remedies such as herbs. (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>Magic rejects politics as no more than some people's perverse desire
 to dominate others.  It does well to dissociate itself from this monkey
 squabble and advocates instead personal enlightenment and emancipation,
 which are the only real safeguards to freedom. (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>Magic is anti-ideological because the main products of ideological
 solutions are repression and corpses. (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>Magic is profoundly opposed to religion.  Although a religion may appear
 benign when it is in decline, at least half of the madness and violent
 deaths of history have been caused by mindless adherence to religions.
 (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>Magic is also opposed to the superstition that the world is wholly
 material and that men's actions are not intimately interwoven with
 the psychic sphere. (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>Magic aligns itself to a vision of chaotic good [to oppose repressive
 forms of order which often impose themselves by evil means]. (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>Magic's commitment to the good is reflected in its concern with
 individual freedom and consciousness and its interest in all other
 life forms on this planet.  At the highest level this manifests as
 some unspecified feeling for the "vibes" generated by human thought
 and action. (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>The chaotic aspect of new aeon magic is psychological anarchy.
 It is a species of operation mindfuck applied to ourselves as much
 of the world.  The aim is to produce inspiration and enlightenment
 through disordering our belief structures.  Humor, random belief,
 counter-information and disinformation are its techniques. (Pgs 113-115)
 <LI>Full rituals of the meditative or ecstatic variety
 are usually directed towards one of the four objectives: <BR>
 Enchantment - making things happen directly by magic<BR>
 Evocation - making things happen through the agency of various
 demons and elementals<BR>
 Invocation - the summoning of various entities and thought forms
 for the inspiration of their knowledge and conversation<BR>
 Divination - obtaining knowledge by direct magical means. (Pgs 118-119)
 <LI>The simplest way to orchestrate these rituals for group work
 is for a presiding officer to perform the main ritual sequence and
 have the participants deliver their visualizations, mantras,
 ritual movements and invocations on certain pre-arranged cues. (Pgs 118-119)
 <LI>To be effective, the ritual must work like an automatic mechanism
 in which power can manifest without distraction or hesitation.
 A variety of trance states from mild suggestibility to deep hypnosis
 can be used for group magical work.  One operator will persuade one
 or more subjects into a receptive condition by suggestion or
 invocation, the subject being in a relaxed or lightly drugged
 condition.  The psychic censor is less active in the trance state
 but often acts to block the awareness of magical events from
 reaching other lovels.  When the trance state is controlled by
 another person, this problem can be overcome.  The trance candidate
 can be directed to seek information clairvoyantly and to relate it
 to the operator.  Conversely, the subjects will can be directed to
 perform a magical act that the censor would normally prohibit. (Pgs 118-119)
 <LI>One danger with trance experiments is that the operator's influence
 over the subject may gradually extend itself to non-trance states
 as well.  Another is that the memory and imagination can become very
 active in trance states and begin to delude both operator and subject.
 For these reasons trance experiments should be performed infrequently
 and for objective results only. (Pgs 118-119)
 <LI>Magical training is designed to open up the neglected dream
 level, to provoke an examination of the contents of the robotic
 level, and to add new programs to it.  It should also teach the
 method of turning awareness on or off at will, and of entering
 the gnostic level and acting within it. (Pg 123)
 <LI>The normal human life is spent in oscillating between the unconscious
 and robotic levels, punctuated by odd moments of dreaming and awareness.
 The magician may well strive to establish a new oscillation between
 dreaming and awareness with occasional excursions into the robotic
 and gnostic levels for specific purposes. (Pg 123)
 <LI>Magical attack takes two forms.  At long range, telepathic
 information
 is sent which makes the target destroy itself.... At short range, it is
 possible to injure or drain an adversary's energy field using one's own.
 This demands close proximity, usually contact.  Magical close combat
 of this type is not effected by mere will or visualization, but by
 projecting a force that can actually be felt, usually through the hands.
 More rarely the force can be projected through the voice or the eyes or
 carried on the breath.  The force originates in the navel area and is
 aroused by the disciplines of breath, concentration, visualization and by
 sexual disciplines.  A part of this force is put into the enemy's body to
 cause a disruption of the vital energies leading to disease and
 death.... (Pgs 125-127)
 <LI>As with all things, constructive activities are a far greater challenge
 to our skills than destructive ones. (Pgs 125-127)
 <LI>Because consciousness does not fit into... mechanistic
 schemes, [scientists] declare it illusory.  Magicians make exactly
 the reverse argument.  Observing consciousness in themselves and
 animals, they are magnanimous enough to extend it to all things to
 some degree - trees, amulets, planetary bodies, and all. (Pg 151)
 <LI>To explain their occult and mystical experiences, magicians are forced
 to develop models beyond the scope of materialistic or religious
 systems.  To the magician it is self-evident that there is some other
 level of reality than the purely physical.  Medieval magicians thought
 that their powers emanated from God or the Devil.  In fact, magic works
 equally well in any god's name for good, evil, neutral or indifferent
 motives. (Pg 151)
 <LI>Magic offers an alternative view [of the human experience,
 than the radical stimulus-response behaviorists or the radical
 god-puppets of the religious].  Consciousness occurs when the Kia
 (which is equivalent to free will and perception, but is itself
 formless) touches the materiality (the ego, mind, sensory and
 extra-sensory information, etc.).  So we have both of these things,
 but we are neither of them; we experience our being only at their
 place of meeting. (Page 152)
 <LI>Occasionally consciousness is able to make things happen
 spontaneously outside the body when it performs magic.  Any act of
 will is magic.  Conversely, any act of conscious perception is also
 magic; an occurrence in nervous matter is spontaneously perceived in
 consciousness.  Sometimes that perception can occur directly
 without the use of senses, as in clairvoyance. (Pg 153)
 <LI>Magic is not just confined to consciousness.  All events, including the
 origin of the universe, happen basically by magic.  That is to say, they
 arise spontaneously without a final prior cause. (Pg 153)
 <LI>...it is very difficult to imagine events arising spontaneously
 without prior cause even though this happens every time one exerts
 one's will.  For this reason it has seemed preferrable to call this
 root of phenomena Chaos.  (Page 153)
 <LI>Magical, mystical and religious enterprises seek to fulfill five
 basic human needs, which can be identified as follows:<BR>
        To provide techniques of Emotional Engineering<BR>
        To give life a sense of Meaning<BR>
        To provide some means of Intercession and Intervention<BR>
        To supply an explanation of Death<BR>
        To formulate a Social Structure or Cult<BR> (Pg 179)
 <LI>Private religion inevitably evolves into mysticism or magic, and
 these have a tendency to devolve into new religions. (Pg 181)
 <LI>[To the magician, spirit and matter] are both part of the same thing,
 and he exalts neither above the other.  He rejects no part of his
 experience.  The magician lives in a continuum beginning with the
 sublime and ineffable Tao/God/Chaos through the mysterious and
 subtle Aethers to the awesome and strange material world.  To the
 magician, any piece of knowledge, any new power, any opportunity
 for enlightenment is worth having for its own sake.  The only thing
 abhorred in this incredible existence is failure to come to grips with
 some part of it.  To be able to operate in all spheres, the magician
 must master the art of either acting without belief or of being able
 to invest belief temporarily in anything with which he is experimenting.
 The magician should be equally at home with a crozier, a paintbrush,
 a test tube, or a wand.  In all things he is seeking to bring his Kia
 into manifestation; for him life is its own answer, and the way he lives
 it in his spirituality. (Pg 181-182)
 <LI>The magician should be capable of performing any ritual
 on the astral, that is to say, by the power of imagination alone.
 By strongly visualizing any of his weapons to the point where he
 actually hallucinates their presence, he draws both the aetheric
 form of the weapon and the associated powers within himself into
 action.  Such empty-hand techniques are the mark of the adept. (Pg 189)

<A NAME="gnosis"></A>
<H3>Gnosis</H3>

<UL>
<LI>[state of mind to be achieved/attained] ; no-mind; samadhi;
one-pointedness/one-pointed consciousness/single-pointed
concentration; stopping the inner dialogue; passing through the eye of
the needle; ain or nothing; It is an extension of the magical trance by
other means. (Pg 131)

<LI>Certain forms of gnosis lend themselves more readily to some forms
of magic than others.(Pg 35)

<LI>...the methods of exaltation. (Pg 35)

<LI>Gnosis is the mechanism by which Kia draws back from the flesh in
preparation for the mighty indulgences of magic.  A great saving to
accomplish a greater spending.(Pg 60)

<LI>Gnosis, the Alphabet of Desire, and other magical methods tend to
liberate.(Pg 90)

<LI>It is quite simple to state exactly what Gnosis is and how to reach
it.  Gnosis is intense consciousness of something, including the ideas
of self or nothingness.  Most extremes of emotionality (and not just
the nice emotions) can initiate it, and so can a profound act of single-
pointed concentration on something. (Pgs 122-123)

<LI>This intense consciousness leads mystics into three common errors.
It may create the illusion that oneself and the object of contemplation
are the same thing.  It may lead to the conviction that oneself no longer
exists, and it may lead to the obsession that the object of concentration
is the supreme thing in the universe. (Pgs 122-123)

<LI>Magically, Gnosis is the state which most easily allows the will and
perception to reach out and touch realities beyond the mind.  The contents
of gnosis are far less interesting than what can be done with it. (Pgs
122-123)
