Best of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre</i>  (New
York: Ballantine, 1963), p. 220.<p>
<sup>2</sup> Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i>
(Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press). "The anomalous is neither an
individual nor a species; it has only affects, it has neither familiar or
subjectified feelings, nor specific or significant characteristics.  Human
tenderness is as foreign to it as human<p>
classifications.  Lovecraft applies the term 'Outsider' to this thing<p>
or entity, the Thing which arrives and passes at the edge, which is linear yet
multiple, 'teeming, seething, swelling, foaming, spreading like an infectious
disease, his nameless horror.'"  (244-5) "What we are saying is that every
animal is fundamentally a band, a pack...It is at this point that the human
being encounters the animal.  We do not become animal without a fascination for
the pack, for multiplicity.  A fascination for the outside?  Or is the
multiplicity that fascinates us already related to a multiplicity dwelling
within us?  In one of his masterpieces, H.P. Lovecraft recounts the story of
Randolph Carter, who feels his 'self' reel and who experiences a fear worse
than that of annihilation: 'Carters of form both human and nonhuman, vertebrate
and invertebrate .... etc'"(240)<p>

<a name="fn2">[4]</a>One notable exception to this is <i>The Starry Wisdom</i>,
D.M. Mitchell's recent British collection of Mythos tales and art that bristles
with experimental and chthonic magick (London:  Creation Books, 1994).
Contributors range from J.G. Ballard and William S. Burroughs to Grant Morrison
and Alan Moore, two of today's most intelligent comic book writers. Though the
bios make no mention of the fact, a number of the contributors, including Don
Webb, are solid occultists. On the other hand, the author of one of the more
perverse tales is Robert M. Price, a New Testament scholar and pastor of the
First Baptist Church of Montclair, New Jersey. <p>

<a name="fn12">[14]</a> Joshi, p.32.<p>
<a name="fn13">[15]</a>  The imaginative production of a role-playing game's
"virtual reality" is not dissimilar to ceremonial magic.  RPGs consist of a
defined space and time; random dicethrows; source books; a game system that
organizes numbers, rules and characteristics; and, most importantly, the active
imagination of the players. Organized magical rituals follow a superficially
similar scheme: a coherent and graded system carves out a performative space
and time wherein divinatory randomness, data from occult cookbooks, and
symbolic networks of numbers and signs come to life within the active
imagination of the mage, a "playful" imagination that calls forth--and even
becomes--the autonomous "characters" of the gods. <p>
	 From ancient ritualistic board games to the Golden Dawn's Enochian Chess,
games have been vehicles for magic and divination. Recently Chaosium, the
publisher of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, has cemented the connection with
<i>Nephilim</i>, the first explicitly occult role-playing game. You play one
the <i>Nephilim</i>, a race of magical beings who battle secret societies and
must take over living human hosts in their quest for enlightenment. Already
banned in some stores, <i>Nephilim</i> artfully and systematically melds deep
and genuine esoteric arcana (kabbalah, alchemy, astrology) with an original
variant of the occult conspiracy theory of history. <p>
<a name="fn14">[16]</a> Following the logic of the Freudian slip, Spare
workings such as sigil magic must be "forgotten" in order for their encoded
intention to "break through" into reality. <p>

dreams in <i>Dreams and Fantasies</i> (Suak City, Wis.: Arkham House, 1962).<p>
