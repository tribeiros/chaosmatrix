<H1>Kaos Kabbalah</H1>
<H3>by Frater Ashachor 000</H3>

<P><HR><P>

The Kabbalah is a very powerful system which can be used rather easily, and
<I>very</I> effectively, especially once you get all the ceremonial or white
and fluffy shit out of it.  It is a system that was developed by the wandering
Hebrew nomads of the middle east.  They were a tribal people, with twelve
tribes, herded goat and live stock, and wandered from place to place, placing
their lives in the hands of nature, and the desert itself.  To have the upper
hand, they developed a system of magick, powerful, intense, raw, untamed
magick.  Later they turned it into a religion, and it lost much of its power,
but of course as we can see from quite a few labeled "miracle workers", they
system never lost its potential, and I am here, to unlock the key to its
origins, and unleash the mighty beast that it truly is. <P>

Each of the Hebrew letters, is a key, a key to vast magickal power.  Each
creates some sort of rip in the boundaries between "this world", and the realm
of aether.  Each has some specific meaning and purpose, that allows it to tear
open that boundary, and unleash its power of unlimited possibility.<P>

So disregard all that you "know" about this system, no more ceremonial
trappings, no more countless equations, no more "true will" or "higher
meaning".  All that lies ahead, is sheer raw power.<P>

Each letter you may notice, has a small little like "cowlick" on its top, this
is the piece that rips open the hole. This little cowlick is actually a tiny
letter Yod (the tenth letter, the one that is not much more then a little
fooped dot that hangs there in the air.  This is where each letter gets its
power from, where it "plugs itself in" so to say into the power source.  This
yod, is the power point of the letter.  <P>

And some letters have more than one of these little Yods, so of course create
more tears in the fabric of reality, so of course effect that letter as would
be expected.<P>

First off, when you read in any Hebrew incantation, or prayer or spell, or
whatever the like, when it says some "name of god", it refers to magick, to
the unlimited power of chaos.  So when you place the name of god somewhere,
any one of the numerous Kabbalistic names, you are not drawing down the power
of "god", but the power of Chaos.  That unimaginable and indescribable void
where all emanates and goes back to, where all possibilities are reality.<P>

So when you call upon or declare the name of "god, such as YHVH (Yod Hei Vov
Hei), you are calling upon the god within, the god that YOU are, that calls
forth and commands the realms of chaos, as well as all others.<P>

A powerful way to draw upon the power of the letters is to trace them astrally
with your finger, or upon a piece of paper (traditionally with a feather quill
for pen, and parchment for paper, but "nothing is true, everything is
permitted". . .) I have had some AMAZING results with a ball pointed pen and a
piece of paper, then rolling it up as a scroll and binding it with string or a
leather thong, the binding being the finilization of the enchantment, the
releasing of it, making it *DO*.<P>

It can be an enchantment, you bind the scroll, and thetas it.  Or it can also
be a charm or amulet, you can wear it around you neck, keep it in a pocket,
hang it on a bed post for it to work its magick while you sleep (this I have
done with TREMENDOUS results).  Many many uses for a "Kameah" as it is called
in Hebrew.<P>

One thing, I *AM* disregarding just about all tradition from the Kabbalistic
system of magick, but ONE thing I keep, "Nothing is true, everything is
permitted ", so if you want to disregard go for it.  But I refuse to use metal
as a cover, or to hold a kameah.  It is a tradition the Baal Shem Tov (master
of the good name, so titled since he had mastered and learnt the powers of the
various names, and used them for amazing magickal purposes).  He said not to
use metal for the cover of a kameah, so I don't. and have had quite a few
visions and experiences where I got "vibes" out of it that metal actually
should NOT be used, because it hinders the magickal powers.<P>

The letters and words can be played off, and effect and compliment each other,
they all interact with each other, and can result in rather amazing effects,
much like a bunch of drops of water, each effect the other, are independent,
separate, but at the same time are the whole body of water, one huge magickal
entity.<P>

So far, from my research and experimentation with this whole system, most, if
not all, of the letters are directors, or windows, or doorways to power.  They
create a whole conduit like system of power, like when you draw from the power
of YHVH, the Yod, serves as the letter that taps into the power, tears open
the hole and empowers the rest of the word, it "plugs it in", for it to draw
power from.<P>

Then the letter Hei, serves as a doorway, literally like opening a conduit of
raw untamed energy from "the other side". So the Yod starts the powering up,
it taps it in, then the Hei opens the corridor and lets it stream in.<P>

Now the next letters of YHVH, VH, Vov and the second Hei, the Vov is nothing
more than an elongated Yod, it is a Yom which comes down, i.e., since a Yod
draws forth the power, crates the rip between the barriers, then the Vov is
the bringing down, the actualization of the possibilities, its what gives you
the power to control it.  It is shaped as a staff, and as a staff gives you
the control to actually *wield* the raw power, to direct it to make it fulfill
your desire. To make you statement of intent, a reality.<P>

The last letter, the second Hei, is another doorway, and just as the first
opens another conduit of mass untamed energy.  And this is what is so powerful
about the name YHVH, it opens two conduits, one, for energy from the realm to
enter you, and the second, it opens a second one, for your energy to enter
back into it, so you mix your energies, without hat of the mass void of chaos,
so you are linked to it through a direct flow that travels through you, a
circle that goes through you, and it, and mixes and combines your energies.<P>

I have done this a quite a few times, and have almost passed out a number of
times from the sheer, raw overflow of wild magickal energy, then I just sat
there, or most of the time laid down, and just let myself be bathed in the
sensation of it all, the overwhelming power of it.<P>

The Vov, can be used to make an enchantment out of it, either to visualize a
sigil, or desire, or chant your desire in Hebrew, or even English, and project
it onto that letter, since it is what wields the power, controls and navigates
it, so you just navigate it to your desire.<P>

<HR><P>

The Letters.<P>

Here, I will talk about the various powers and such of the Hebraic
alphabet.<P>

Aleph The first letter.<P>

Sound None, takes the sound of whatever vowel it represents<P>

Gemmatria 1:<P>

What is amazing about this letter, is that it is really a sigil of three
other letters, two Yods, and one Vov in the middle.  These equal in gemmatria
26, which is also the gemmatria of YHVH, so this letter is nothing more than
the sigil, of that name.  So of course, it has quite a number of intense
powers and uses.<P>

One way I have found which is a powerful way to draw upon this letter, is to
trace it in the air, or on a kameah as stated before, but write a small YHVH
on each four sides, on letter, like<P>

<PRE>
             H            Y

                  Aleph

             H            V

</PRE>

In that arrangement since Hebrew goes from right to left.  And on the middle
of the Aleph, the "axis" like, the Vov, you project your desire/statement of
intent upon.<P>

During this ritual my entire chest area felt like it was dissolved into pure
raw, unexplainably intense magickal power.<P>

Can be used for enchantments, or to charge ritual items, or anything where
just raw, untamed energy is needed.  I have carved it upon my wand which I
made at the beginning of my MMM work, and the amazing force that comes
through it, through that letter, is just something fierce. So can be used as
an enchanter, a harnesser, an enpowerer, can place it in front of other words
to give them added power, as well as whatever else we may find out. . . <P>

Shin Second to last letter<P>

Sound Sh<P>

Gemmatria 300<P>

Is much like the rune Thurisaz for those of you familiar with rune magick.  It
is an aggressive letter, it has 3 Yods on its top, and then 3 Vovs coming down
from them connecting at a common point, where all the energy is concentrated
and realised.  It can be used for protection (Shemirah in Hebrew begins with
Shin).  It has the shape of a crown, so as to represent that this is a TAKE
CHARGE letter, it is KING, it is POWER.  By taking this letter, you are taking
CONTROL.  You are god, do what you wish with your power.<P>

It is also a glyph of a man with his arms outstretched towards the sky,
drawing forth the vast powers of chaos, drawing upon his desires and making
them reality.<P>

This letter works rather well with Aleph, the two letters together, Aleph,
Shin, make the word Ash, fire.  If you add an Aleph to the word Shemirah, you
get Ashmeirah, which means fire protection.  By making the Vulcan sign with
your hands (which is actually a letter Shin, Gene Rodenbury was Jewish, and
knew this was the sign the ancient Jewish high priests used to bless the
people) So when you make this sign, you are drawing upon the power of the
letter, you are crowning yourself god, your god within.<P>

Well that’s all FOR NOW, is an ongoing experiment and deconstruction, also
experimenting on writing it from left to right, as w ell as MANY other
things...<P>
