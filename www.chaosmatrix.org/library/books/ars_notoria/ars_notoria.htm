<P>[Introduction from H: It is called the Notory Art because in certain breif
notes it teacheth and comprehendeth the knowledge of all arts. This fifth part
is a books of orations and prayers that wise Solomon used upon the altar in the
temple, called Ars Nova, &amp; was revealed to Solomon by the holy angel of God
called Michael and he also received many breif notes written by the finger of
god which was delivered to him by the said angel with thunder claps, without
which notes King Solomon had never obtained his great knowledge from those notes
it is called the notary art. </P>
<P>* This is a flower of the sun (as Dr. Rudd calls it) fit for every mans

<H3>The NOTORY ART OF SOLOMON.</H3><FONT size=2>
<P>------------------------- </P></FONT>
<H4>The Notory Art revealed by the Most High Creator to Solomon.</H4><FONT
size=2>
<P>In the Name of the holy and undivided Trinity, beginneth this most holy Art
of Knowledge, Revealed to SOLOMON, which the Most High Creator by his holy Angel
ministred to SOLOMON upon the Altar of the Temple; that thereby in a short time
he knew all Arts and Sciences, both Liberal and Mechanick, with all the
Faculties and Properties thereof: He had suddenly infused into him, and also was
filled with all wisdom, to utter the sacred mysteries of most holy words.
</P><I>
<P>Alpha and Omega!</I> Oh Almighty God, the beginning of all things, without
beginning, and without end: Graciously this day hear my prayers; neither do thou
render unto me according to my sins, nor after mine iniquities, O Lord my God,
but according to thy mercy, which is greater then all things visible and
invisible. Have mercy upon me, O Christ, the Wisdom of the Father, the Light of
Angels, the Glory of Saints, the Hope, Refuge, and Support of Sinners, the
Creator of all things, the Redeemer of all humane Frailties, who holdest the
Heaven, Earth, and Sea, and all the whole World, in the palm of thy Hand: I
humbly implore and beseech, That thow wilt mercifully with the Father,
illustrate my Minde with the beams of thy holy Spirit, that I may be able to
come and attain to the perfection of this most holy Art, and that I may be able
to gain the knowledge of every Science, Art, and Wisdom; and of every Faculty of
Memory, Intelligences, Understanding, and Intellect, by the Vertue and Power of
thy most holy Spirit, and in thy Name. And thou, O God my God, who in the
beginning hast created the Heaven and the Earth, and all things out of nothing;
who reformest, and makest all things by thy own Spirit; compleat, fulfil,
restore, and implant a sound Understanding in me, that I may glorifie thee and
all thy Works, in all my Thoughts, Words, and Deeds. O God the Father, confirm
and grant this my Prayer, and increase my Understanding and Memory, and
strengthen the same, to know and receive the Science, Memory, Eloquence, and
Perseverance in all manner of Learning, who livest and reignest World without
end. <I>Amen.</I> </P>
<P>------------------------</P></FONT><I>
<H4>Here beginneth the first Treatise of this Art, which Master</I> Apollonius
<I>calleth,</I> The golden Flowers, <I>being the generall Introduction to all
Natural Sciences; and this is Confirmed, Composed, and Approved by the Authority
of</I> Solomon, Manichæus, <I>and</I> Euduchæus.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>I</FONT><FONT size=2> <I>Apollonius</I> Master of Arts, duly called, to whom
the Nature of Liberal Arts hath been granted, am intended to treat of the
Knowledge of Liberal Arts, and of the Knowledge of Astronomy; and with what
Experiments and Documents, a Compendious and Competent Knowledge of Arts may be
attained unto; and how the highest and lowest Mysteries of Nature may be
competently divided, and fitted and applied to the Natures of Times; and what
proper dayes and hours are to be elected for the Deeds and Actions of men, to be
begun and ended; what Qualifications a man ought to have, to attain the Efficacy
of this Art; and how he ought to dispose of the actions of his life, and to
behold and study the Course of the Moon. In the first place therefore, we shall
declare certain precepts of the Spiritual Sciences; that all things which we
intend to speak of, may be attained to in order. Wonder not therefore, at what
you shall hear and see in this subsequent Treatise, and that you shall finde an
Example of such inestimable Learning. </P>
<P>Some things which follow, which we will deliver to thee as Essayes of
wonderful Effects, and have extracted them out of the most ancient Books of the
Hebrews; which, where thou seest them, (although they are forgotten, and worn
out of any humane Language) nevertheless esteem them as Miracles: For I do truly
admire the great Power and Efficacy of Words in the Works of Nature. </P></FONT>
<H4>Of what efficacy words are.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>here is so great Vertue, Power and Efficacy in certain
Names and Words of God, that when you reade those very Words, it shall
immediately increase and help your Eloquence, so that you shall be made eloquent
of speech by them, and at length attain to the Effects of the powerful Sacred
Names of God: but from whence the power hereof doth proceed, shall be fully
demonstrated to you in the following Chapters of Prayers: and those which follow
next to our hand, we shall lay open.</P></FONT>
<H4>An explanation of the Notary Art.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>his art is divided into two parts: The first containeth
general Rules, the second special Rules. We come first to the special Rules;
that is, First, to a threefold, and then to a fourfold Division: And in the
third place we come to speak of Theology; which Sciences thou shalt attain to,
by the Operation of these Orations, if thou pronounce them as it is written:
Therefore there are certain Notes of the Notary Art, which are manifest to us;
the Vertue whereof Human Reason cannot comprehend. The first Note hath his
signification taken from the Hebrew; which though the expression thereof be
comprehended in a very few words; nevertheless, in the expression of the
Mystery, they do not lose their Vertue: That may be called their Vertue, which
doth happen and proceed from their pronunciation, which ought to be greatly
admired at.</P></FONT>
<H4>The first precept.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>H</FONT><I><FONT size=2>Ely Scemath, Amazaz, Hemel; Sathusteon, hheli
Tamazam,</I> &amp;c. which <I>Solomon</I> entituled, <I>His first
Revelation</I>; and that to be without any Interpretation: It being a Science of
so Transcendent a purity, that it hath its Original out of the depth and
profundity of the <I>Chaldee, Hebrew,</I> and <I>Grecian</I> Languages; and
therefore cannot possible by any means be explicated fully in the poor
Thread-bare Scheme of our Language. And of what nature the Efficacy of the
aforesaid words are, <I>Solomon</I> himself doth describe in his Eleventh Book,
<I>Helisoe</I>, of the Mighty Glory of the Creator: but the Friend and Successor
of <I>Solomon</I>, that is, <I>Apollonius</I>, with some few others, to whom
that Science hath been manifested, have explained the same, and defined it to be
most Holy, Divine, Deep, and Profound Mysteries; and not to be disclosed nor
pronounced, without great Faith and Reverence. </P></FONT>
<H4>A Spiritual Mandate of the precedent Oration.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>B</FONT><FONT size=2>efore any one begin to reade or pronounce any Orations
of this Art, to bring them to effect, let them alwayes first reverently and
devoutly rehearse this Prayer in the beginning. </P>
<P>If any one will search the Scriptures, or would understand, or eloquently
pronounce any part of Scripture, let him pronounce the words of the following
Figure, to wit, <I>Hely scemath, in the morning betimes of that day, wherein
thou wilt begin any work. And in the Name of the Lord our God, let him
diligently pronounce the Scripture proposed, with this Prayer which follows,
which is, Theos Megale</I>; And is mystically distorted, and miraculously and
properly framed out of the <I>Hebrew, Greek </I>, and <I>Chaldean</I> Tongues:
and it extendeth itself briefly into every Language, in what beginning soever
they are declared. The second part of the Oration of the second Chapter, is
taken out of the <I>Hebrew, Greek, and Chaldee</I>; and the following Exposition
thereof, ought to be pronounced first, which is a Latine Oration: The third
Oration of the three Chapters, always in the beginning of every Faculty, is
first to be rehearsed. </P>
<P>The Oration is, <I>Theos Megale, in tu ymas Eurel</I>, &amp;c. </P>
<P>This sheweth, how the foregoing Prayer is expounded: But although this is a
particular and brief Exposition of this Oration; yet do not think, that all
words are thus expounded.</P></FONT>
<H4>The Exposition of this Oration.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>O</FONT><FONT size=2>H God, the Light of the World, Father of Immense
Eternity, Giver of all Wisdom and Knowledge, and of all Spiritual Grace; most
Holy and Inestimable Dispenser, knowing all things before they are made; who
makest Light and Darkness: Stretch forth thy Hand, and touch my Mouth, and make
my Tongue as a sharp sword; to shew forth these words with Eloquence; Make my
Tongue as an Arrow elected to declare thy Wonders, and to pronounce them
memorably: Send forth thy holy Spirit, O Lord, into my Heart and Soul, to
understand and retain them, and to meditate on them in my Conscience: By the
Oath of thy Heart, that is, By the Right-hand of thy holy Knowledge, and
mercifully inspire thy Grace into me; Teach and instruct me; Establish the
coming in and going out of my Senses, and let thy Precepts teach and correct me
until the end; and let the Councel of the most High assist me, through thy
infinite Wisdom and Mercy. <I>Amen</I>. </P></FONT>
<H4>The words of these Orations cannot be wholly Expounded.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>N</FONT><FONT size=2>Either think, that all words of the preceding Oration
can be translated into the Latin Tongue: For some words of that Oration contain
in themselves a greater Sense of Mystical Profundity, of the Authority of
<I>Solomon</I>; and having reference to his Writings, we acknowledge, That these
Orations cannot be expounded nor understood by humane sense: For it is
necessary, That all Orations, and distinct particulars of Astronomy, Astrology,
and the Notary Art, be spoken and pronounced in their due time and season; and
the Operations of them to be made according to the disposition of the Times.
</P></FONT>
<H4>Of the Triumphal Figures, how sparingly they are to be pronounced, and
honestly and devoutly spoken.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>here are also certain Figures or Orations, which
<I>Solomon</I> in <I>Chaldeack, calleth Hely</I>; that is, Triumphal Orations of
the Liberal Arts, and sudden excellent Efficacies of Vertues; and they are the
Introduction to the Notary Art. Wherefore <I>Solomon</I> made a special
beginning of them, that they are to be pronounced at certain determinate times
of the Moon; and not to be undertaken, without consideration of the end. Which
also <I>Magister Apollonius</I> hath fully and perfectly taught, saying,
Whosoever will pronounce these words let him do it in a determinate appointed
time, and set aside all other occasions, and he shall profit in all Sciences in
one Moneth, and attain to them in an extraordinary wonderful manner. </P></FONT>
<H4>The Expositions of the Lunations of the Notary Art.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>Hese are the Expositions of the Lunation, and
Introduction of the Notary Art, to wit, in the fourth and the eighth day of the
Moon; and in the twelfth, sixteenth, four and twentieth, eight and twentieth,
and thirtieth they ought to be put in operation. From whence <I>Solomon</I>
saith, That to those times, we give the expositive times of the Moon; of the
fourth day of the Moon which are written by the four Angels; and in the fourth
day of the Moon is manifested to us; and are four times repeated and explained
by the Angel, the Messenger of these Orations; and are also revealed and
delivered to us that require them from the Angel, four times of the year, to
shew the Eloquence and Fulness of the four Languages, <I>Greek, Hebrew,
Chaldee</I> and <I>Latine</I>; and God hath determined the Power of the
Faculties of Humane Understanding, to the four Parts of the Earth; and also the
four Vertues of Humanities, Understanding, Memory, Eloquence, and the Faculty of
Ruling those three. And these things are to be used as we have before spoken.
</P></FONT>
<H4>He sheweth how the precedent Oration is the Beginning and Foundation of the
whole Art.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>Hat is the first Figure of the Notary Art, which is
manifestly sited upon a Quadrangle Note: And this is Angelical Wisdom,
understood of few in Astronomy; but in the Glass of Astrology, it is called, The
Ring of Philosophy; and in the Notary Art it is written, To be the Foundation of
the whole Science. But it is to be rehearsed four times a day, beginning in the
morning once, about the third hour once, once in the ninth hour, and once in the
evening. </P>
<P>The precedent Oration ought to be spoken secretly; and let him that speaks it
be alone, and pronounce it with a low voyce, so that he scarcely hear himself.
And this is the condition hereof, that if necessity urge one to do any great
works, he shall say it twice in the morning, and about the ninth hour twice; and
let him fast the first day wherein he rehearseth it, and let him live chastly
and devoutly. And this is the oration which he shall say: </P>
<P>This is the Oration of the four Tongues, <I>Chaldee, Greek, Hebrew</I> and
<I>Latine</I>, evidently expounded, which is called, "the Splendor or
<I>Speculum</I> of Wisdom." In all holy Lunations, these Orations ought to be
read, once in the morning, once about the third hour, once about the ninth hour,
and once in the evening. </P></FONT>
<H4>The Oration.</H4><I><FONT size=2>
<P>Assaylemath, Assay, Lemeth, Azzabue.</I> </P></FONT>
<H4>The second part of the precedent Orations, which is to be said onely
once.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>A</FONT><I><FONT size=2>Zzaylemath, Lemath, Azacgessenio.</P></I></FONT>
<H4>The third part of the precedent Oration, which is to be spoken together with
the other.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>L</FONT><I><FONT size=2>emath, Sebanche, Ellithy, Aygezo.</P></I></FONT>
<H4>This Oration hath no Exposition in the Latine.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>His is a holy Prayer, without danger of any sin, which
<I>Solomon</I> saith, is inexplicable be humane sense. And he addeth, and saith,
That the Explication thereof is more prolixious, than can be considered of or
apprehended by man; excepting also those secrets, which is not lawful, neither
is it given to man to utter: Therefore he leaveth this Oration without any
Exposition, because no man could attain to the perfection thereof: and it was
left so Spiritual, because the Angel that declared it to <I>Solomon</I>, laid an
inexcusable prohibition upon it, saying, See that thou do not presume to give to
any other, nor to expound any thing out of this Oration, neither thou thy self,
nor any one by thee, nor any one after thee: For it is a holy and Sacramental
Mystery, that by expressing the words thereof, God heareth thy Prayer, and
increaseth thy Memory, Understanding, Eloquence, and establisheth them all in
thee. Let it be read in appointed times of the Lunation; as, in the fourth day
of the Moon, the eighth and twelfth, as it is written and commanded: say that
Oration very diligently four times in those dayes; verily believing, That
thereby thy study shall suddenly be increased, and made clear, without any
ambiguity, beyond the apprehension of humane Reason.</P></FONT>
<H4>Of the Efficacy of that Oration which is inexplicable to humane
sense.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>His is that onely which <I>Solomon</I> calls The
happiness of Wit, and M. <I>Apollonius</I> termeth it, The Light of the Soul,
and the <I>Speculum</I> of Wisdom: And, I suppose, the said Oration may be
called, The Image of Eternal Life: the Vertue and Efficacy whereof is so great,
that it is understood or apprehended of very few or none. </P>
<P>Therefore having essayed some Petitions, Signs and Precepts, we give them as
an entrance to those things whereof we intend to speak; of which they are part,
that we have spoken of before. Nevertheless, before we come to speak of them,
some things are necessary to be declared, whereby we may more clearly and
plainly set forth our intended History: For, as we have said before, there are
certain Exceptions of the Notary Art; some whereof are dark and obscure, and
others plain and manifest. </P>
<P>For the Notary Art hath a Book in Astronomy, whereof it is the Beginning and
mistris; and the Vertue thereof is such, that all Arts are taught and derived
from her. And we are further to know, That the Notary Art doth in a wonderful
manner contain and comprehend within it self, all Arts, and the Knowledge of all
Learning, as <I>Solomon</I> witnesseth: Therefore it is called, <I>The Notary
Art</I>, because in certain brief Notes, it teacheth and comprehendeth the
knowledge of all Arts: for so <I>Solomon</I> also saith in his Treatise
<I>Lemegeton</I>, that is, in his Treatise of Spiritual and Secret Experiments.
</P></FONT>
<H4>Here he sheweth, in what manner those Notes differ in Art, and the reason
thereof; for a Note is a certain knowledge, by the Oration and Figure before set
down.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>B</FONT><FONT size=2>Ut of the Orations and Figures, mention shall be made in
their due place, and how the Notes are called in the Notary Art. Now he maketh
mention of that Oration, which is called, The Queen of Tongues: for amongst
these Orations, there is one more excellent than the rest, which King
<I>Solomon</I> would therefore have be called, The Queen of Tongues, because it
takes away, as it were, with a certain Secret covering the Impediments of the
Tongue, and giveth it a marvellous Faculty of Eloquence. Wherefore before we
proceed further, take a little Essay of that Oration: For this is an Oration
which in the Scriptures we are taught to have alwayes in our mouthes; but it is
taken out of the <I>Chaldean</I> Language: which, although it be short, is of a
wonderful Vertue; that when you reade that Scripture, with the Oration
before-mentioned, you cannot keep silent those things, which the Tongue and
Understanding suggest, and administer to thee. </P>
<P>The Oration which follows, is a certain Invocation of the Angels of God, and
it provoketh Eloquence, and ought to be said in the beginning of the Scripture,
and in the beginning of the Moneth. </P></FONT>
<H4>The Oration</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>[1] </FONT><FONT size=5>L</FONT><I><FONT size=2>Ameth, Leynach, Semach,
Belmay,</I> (these Orations have not proper Lunations, as the Commentator saith
upon the Gloss, <I>Azzailement, Gesegon, Lothamasim, Ozetogomaglial, Zeziphier,
Josanum, Solatar, Bozefama, Defarciamar, Zemait, Lemaio, Pheralon, Anuc,
Philosophi, Gregoon, Letos, Anum, Anum, Anum.</I>) </P></FONT>
<H4>How this Oration is to be said in the beginning of every Moneth, chastly,
and with a pure minde.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>I</FONT><FONT size=2>N the beginning of the Scriptures, are to be taught, how
the precedent Oration ought to be spoken most secretly, and nothing ought to be
retained, which thy Minde and Understanding suggests and prompts to thee in the
reading thereof: Then also follow certain words, which are Precepts thereof,
which ought alwayes to be begun in the beginning of the Moneth, and also in
other dayes. I would also note this, That it is to be pronounced wisely, and
with the greatest reverence; and that fasting, before you have taken either Meat
or Drink. </P></FONT>
<H4>Here followeth the Prayer we spake of before, to obtain a good
Memory.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>[2] </FONT><FONT size=5>O</FONT><FONT size=2> Most Mighty God, Invisible God,
<I>Theos Patir Heminas</I>; by thy Archangels, <I>Eliphamasay, Gelonucoa,
Gebeche Banai, Gerabcai, Elomnit</I>; and by thy glorious Angels, whose Names
are so Consecrated, that they cannot be uttered by us; which are these, <I>Do.
Hel. X. P. A. Li. O. F.</I> &amp;c. which cannot be Comprehended by Humane
Sense.</P></FONT>
<H4>Here following is the Prologue of the precedent Oration, which provoketh and
procureth Memory, and is continued with the precedent Note.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>His Oration ought to be said next to the precedent
Oration; to wit, <I>Lameth:</I> and with this, I beseech thee to day, <I>O
Theos</I>, to be said always as one continued Oration. If it be for the Memory,
let it be said in the morning; if for any other effect, in the evening. And thus
let it be said in the hour of the evening, and in the morning: And being thus
pronounced, with the precedent Oration, it increaseth the Memory, and helpeth
the Imperfections of the Tongue.</P></FONT>
<H4>Here beginneth the Prologue of this Oration.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>I</FONT><FONT size=2> Beseech thee, O my Lord, to illuminate the Light of my
Conscience with the Splendor of thy Light: Illustrate and confirm my
Understanding, with the sweet odour of thy Spirit. Adorn my Soul, that hearing I
may hear and what I hear, I may retain in my Memory. O Lord, reform my heart,
restore my senses, and strengthen them; qualifie my Memory with thy Gifts:
Mercifully open the dulness of my Soul. O most merciful God, temper the frame of
my Tongue, by thy most glorious and unspeakable Name: Thou who are the Fountain
of all Goodness; the Original and Spring of Piety, have patience with me, give a
good Memory unto me, and bestow upon me what I pray of thee in this holy
Oration. O thou who dost not forthwith Judge a sinner, but mercifully waitest,
expecting his Repentance; I (though unworthy) beseech thee to take away the
guilt of my sins, and wash away my wickedness and offences, and grant me these
my Petitions, by the verture of thy holy Angels, thou who art one God in
Trinity. <I>Amen.</I> </P></FONT>

<P>If thou doubt of any great Vsion, what it may foreshew; or if thou wouldst
see any great Vsion, of any danger present or to come; or if thou wouldst be
certified of any one that is absent, say this Oation three times in the evening
with great reverence and devotion, and thou shalt have and see that which thou
desirest. </P></FONT>
<H4>Here followeth an Oration of great Vertue, to attain the knowledge of the
Physical Art, having also many other Vertues and Efficacy.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>I</FONT><FONT size=2>F you would have the perfect knowledge of any Disease,
whether the same tend to death or life: if the sick party lie languishing, stand

one shall recover, or dye of this Infirmity. </P>
<P>This being done, then ask the sick person, Friend, how dost thou feel thy
self? And if he answer thee. I feel my self at good ease, I begin to mend, or
the like; then judge without doubt, The sick person shall recover: but if he
answer, I am very grievously ill, or worse and worse; then doubtless conclude,
He will dye on the morrow: But if he answer, I know not how my state and
condition is, whether better or worse; then you may know likewise, That he will
either dye, or his disease will change and alter for the worse. If it be a
Childe , that is not of years capable to make an answer; or that the sick
languish so grievously, that he knoweth not how, or will not answer, say this
Oration three times; and what you finde first revealed in your minde, that judge
to come to pass of him. </P>
<P>Furthermore if any one dissemble and seek to hide or cover his infirmity; say
the same Oration, and the Angelical Vertue shall suggest the truth to thee. If
the diseased person be farre off; when you hear his Name, say likewise this
Oration for him, and your minde shall reveal to you whether he shall live or
dye. </P>
<P>If you touch the Pulse of any one that is sick, saying this Oration, the
effect of his Infirmity shall be revealed to you. </P>
<P>Or if you touch the Pulse of any Woman with Childe, saying the same Oration,
it shall be revealed, whether she shall bring forth a Male or Female. </P>
<P>But know, that this Miracle proceeds not from your own Nature, but from the
Nature and Vertue of the holy Angels; it being a part of their Office,
wonderfully to reveal these things to you. If you doubt of the Virginity of any
one, say this Oration in your minde, and it shall be revealed to you, whether
she be a Virgin, or Corrupt. </P></FONT>
<H4>Here follows an efficacious Preface of an Oration, shewing what Verture and
Efficacy you may thereby prove every day.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Of this Oration <I>Solomon</I> saith, That by it a new knowledge of Physick
is to be received from God: Upon which, he hath laid this command, and calleth
it, The Miraculous and Efficacious Foundation of the Physical Science; and that
it containeth in it the quantity and quality of the whole Physical Art and
Science: wherein there is contained, rather a miraculous and specious, then
fearful or terrible Miracle, which as often-soever as thou readest the same,
regard not the paucity of words, but praise the Vertue of so great a Mystery:
For, <I>Solomon</I> himself speaking of the subtility of the Notory Art,
wonderfully extolls the Divine Help; to wit, Because we have proposed a great
thing, that is to say so many and so great Mysteries of Nature, contained under
so specious brevity, that I suppose them to be as a general Problem to be
proposed in the ordination of so subtile and excellent a work; that the minde of
the Reader or Hearer may be the more confirmed and fixed hereupon. </P></FONT>
<H4>Here he sheweth how every Note of every Art, ought to exercise his own
office; and that the Notes of one Art profit not to the knowledge of another
Art; and we are to know, That all Figures have their proper Orations.</H4><FONT
size=2>
<P>We come now, according to our strength, to divide the families of the Notory
Art; and leaving that part which is natural, we come to the greater parts of the
rt: for <I>Solomon</I>, a great Composer, and the greatest Master of the Notory
Art, comprehendeth divers Arts under the Notion thereof. Therefore he calleth
this a Notory Art, because it should be the Art of Arts, and Science of
Sciences; which comprehendeth in it self all Arts and Sciences, Liberal and
Mechanick: And those things which in other Arts are full of long and tedious
locutions, filling up great prolixious Volumes of Books, wearying out the
Student, through the length of time to attain to them: In this Art are
comprehended very briefly in a few words or writings, so that it discovereth
those things which are hard and difficult, making the ingenious learned in a
very short time, by the wonderful and unheard-of Vertue of the words. </P>
<P>Therefore we, to whom such a faculty of the knowledge of the Scripture of
Sciences is granted, have wholly received this great gift, and inestimable
benefit, from the overflowing grace of the most high Creator. And whereas all
Arts have their several Notes properly disposed to them, and signified by their
Figures; and the Note of every Art, hath not any office of transcending to
another Art, neither do the Notes of one Art profit or assist to the knowledge
of another Art: Therefore this may seem a little difficult, as this small
Treatise, which may be called a <I>Preludium</I> to the Body of the Art: we will
explain the Notes severally; and that which is more necessary, we shall by the
Divine Providence diligently search out the several Sciences of the Scripture.
</P></FONT>
<H4>A certain special Precept.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>His is necessary for us, and necessarily we suppose will
be profitable to posterity, that we know how to comprehend the great prolixious
Volumes of writings, in brief and compendious Treatises; which, that it may
easily be done, we are diligently to enquire out the way of attaining to it, out
of the three most ancient Books which were composed by <I>Solomon</I>; the first
and chiefest thing to be understood therein, is, That the Oration before the
second Chapter, is to be used long before every speech, the beginning whereof is
<I>Assay:</I> and the words of the Oration are to be said in a competent space
of time; but the subsequent part of the Oration is then chiefly to be said, when
you desire the knowledge of the Volumes of writings, and looking into the Notes
thereof. The same Oration is also to be said, when you would clearly and plainly
understand and expound any Science or great Mystery, that is on a sudden
proposed to you, which you never heard of before: say also the same Oration at
such time, when any thing of great consequence is importuned of you, which at
present you have not the faculty of expounding. This is a wonderful Oration,
whereof we have spoken; the first part whereof is expounded in the Volume of the
Magnitude of the quality of Art. </P></FONT>
<H4>The Oration.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>L</FONT><I><FONT size=2>Amed, Rogum, Ragia, Ragium, Ragiomal, Agaled,
Eradioch, Anchovionos, Lochen, Saza, Ya, Manichel, Mamacuo, Lephoa, Bozaco,
Cogemal, Salayel, Ytsunanu, Azaroch, Beyestar, Amak.</I> </P>
<P>To the operation of the Magnitude of Art, this Oration containeth in the
second place, a general Treatise of the first Note of all Scripture, part of the
Exposition whereof, we have fully explained in the Magnitude of the quality of
the same Art. But the Reader hath hardly heard of the admirable Mystery of the
Sacramental Intellect of the same: Let him know this for a certain, and doubt
not of the Greek words of the Oration aforesaid, but that the beginning of them
is expounded in Latine.</P></FONT>
<H4>The beginning of the Oration.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>O</FONT><FONT size=2>H Eternal and Unreprehensible Memory! Oh
Uncontradictible Wisdom! Oh Unchangeable Power! Let thy right-hand encompass my
heart, and the holy Angels of thy Eternal Counsel; compleat and fill up my
Conscience with thy Memory, and the odour of thy Ointments; and let the
sweetness of thy Grace strengthen and fortifie my Understanding, through the
pure splendor and brightness of thy holy Spirit; by vertue whereof, the holy
Angels alwayes behold and admire the brightness of thy face, and all thy holy
and heavenly Vertues; Wisdom, wherewith thou hast made all things;
Understanding, by which thou hast reformed all things; Perseverance unto
blessedness, whereby thou hast restored and confirmed the Angels; Love, whereby
thou hast restored lost Mankinde, and raised him after his Fall to Heaven;
Learning, whereby thou wer't pleased to teach <I>Adam</I> the knowledge of every
Science: Inform, repleat, instruct, restore, correct, and refine me, that I may
be made new in the understanding [of] thy Precepts, and in receiving the
Sciences which are profitable for my Soul and Body, and for all faithful
believers in thy Name which is blessed for ever, world without end. </P></FONT>
<H4>Here is also a particular Exposition of the fore-going Oration, which he
hath left unexpounded, to be read by every one that is learned in this Art; and
know, that no humane power nor faculty in man is sufficient to finde out the
Exposition thereof.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>This Oration is also called by <I>Solomon</I>, The Gemme and Crown of the
Lord: for he saith, It helpeth against danger of Fire, or of wilde Beasts of the
Earth, being said with a believing faith: for it is affirmed to have been
reported from one of the four Angels, to whom was given power to hurt the Earth,
the Sea, and the Trees. There is an example of this Oration, in the Book called,
<I>The Flower of heavenly Learning</I>; for herein <I>Solomon</I> glorifieth
God, because by this he inspired into him the knowledge of Theologie, and
dignified him with the Divine Mysteries of his Omnipotent Power and Greatness:
which <I>Solomon</I> beholding in his night-Sacrifice, bestowed upon him by the
Lord his God, he conveniently gathered the greater Mysteries together in this
Notory Art, which were holy, and worthy, and reverend Mysteries. These things
and Mysteries of Theologie the erring Gentiles have not all lost, which
<I>Solomon</I> calleth, The Signe of the holy Mystery of God revealed by his
Angel before; and that which is contained in them, is the fulness of our dignity
and humane Salvation. </P></FONT>
<H4>The first of these Orations which we call Spiritual, the vertue whereof
teacheth Divinity, and preserveth the memory thereof.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>These are Orations also, which are of great virtue and efficacy to our
Salvation: The first whereof is Spiritual, and teacheth Divinity; and also
Perseverance in the Memory thereof: Therefore <I>Solomon</I> commandeth it to be
called, The Signe of the Grace of God: for, as <I>Ecclesiastes</I> saith,
<I>This is the Spiritual Grace of God, that hath given me knowledge to treat of
all Plants, from the Cedar of Lebanon, to the Hyssop that groweth on the wall.
</P></I></FONT>
<H4>The election of time, in what Lunation these Orations ought to be
said.</H4><FONT size=5>
<P>T</FONT><FONT size=2>He first Oration ought to be said once in the first
Lunation; in the third, three times; in the sixth, six times; in the ninth, nine
times; in the twelfth. twelve times; in the seventeenth, seventeen times; and in
the eighteenth, as many times; in the twenty sixth, as many; in the twenty
ninth, as many; and so many in the thirty ninth: for this Oration is of so great
vertue and efficacy, that in the very day thou shalt say the same, as if it were
determined by the Father, it shall increase thy knowledge in the Science of
Divinity. </P>
<P>But if otherwise that thou art ignorant, and it hath been seen by thy
Companions, thy Superiours or Inferiours, though unto others thou shalt seem to
have knowledge; enter into the study of Divinity, and hear the Lectures by the
space of some moneths, casting off all doubt from thee, of them who shall see
thee, to know such things: and in that day wherein thou wouldst say it, live
chastly, and say it in the Morning. </P><I>
<P>Solomon</I> testifieth, That an Angel delivered the following Oration in
Thunder, who standeth alwayes in the Presence of the Lord, to whom he is not
dreadful. The Mystery hereof is holy, and of great efficacy: neither ought this
Oration to be said above once, because it moveth the heavenly Spirits to perform
any great work. </P>
<P>Of this Oration he saith, That so great is the Mystery thereof, that it
moveth the Celestial Spirits to perform any great work which the Divine Power
permitteth. It also giveth the vertue of its Mystery, that it exalteth the
tongue and body of him that speaketh it, with so great inspiration, as if some
new and great Mystery were suddenly revealed to his understanding. </P></FONT>
<H4>Here followeth the beginning of this Oration, wherein is so great vertue and
efficacy, as we have said, it being said with great devotion.</H4><I><FONT
size=2>
<P>Achacham, Yhel, Chelychem, Agzyraztor, Yegor, &amp;c.</I> </P>
<P>This is the beginning of the Oration, the parts whereof are four: But there
is something to be said of the beginning by itself, and of the four parts
severally; and then between the beginning and these Orations, which are four, we
shall make this competent division. </P>
<P>For this is that which is to be spoken of the beginning severally: And this
Oration is to be divided into four parts; and the first part thereof is to be
said, that is, the beginning, before any other part of the Oration is to be
compleated. These Greek Names following are to be pronounced. This is the
division of these Orations, <I>Hielma, Helma, Hemna</I>, &amp;c. Oh God the
Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, Confirm this Oration, and my
Understanding and Memory, to receive, understand, and retain the knowledge of
all good Scriptures; and give me perseverance of minde therein. </P>
<P>This is the beginning of that Oration, which, as we have said before, ought
to be said according to the Prolations and Constitutions thereof; and ought to
be repeated, because of the forgetfulness of our Memory, and according to the
exercise of our wit, and according to the sanctity of our life; there being
contained in it so great a Mystery, and such efficacious Vertue. </P>
<P>There followeth another subtile Oration, wherein is contained a Sacramental
Mystery, and wherein every perfect Science is wonderfully compleated: For hereby
God would have us to know, what things are Celestial, and what are Terrene; and
what heavenly things the Celestial effecteth, and what earthly things things the
Terrene: because the Lord hath said, My eyes have seen the imperfect, and in thy
book every day shall be formed and written, and no man in them, <I>&amp;c</I>.
So it is in the Precepts of God: for we are not able to write all things, how
the Sun hath the same course as at first, that our order may be confirmed: for
all writing whatsoever, which is not from God, is not to be read; for God
himself would have all things to be divided: &amp; this is how these are to be
used, before the second part, which containeth so glorious and excellent
Consecrations of Orations, &amp; defineth the Consecrated part to have power in
the Heavens, and in no wise can be defined by humane tongues. </P></FONT>
<H4>This is the beginning of the second part of that Oration spoken of before,
which is of so great vertue.</H4><I><FONT size=2>
<P>Aglaros, Theomiros, Thomitos,</I> &amp;c. </P>
<P>This is the second part of the precedent Oration, of which some singular
thing is to be spoken. Wherefore if thou sayest this Oration, commemorating the
first part thereof, say the Oration following, and thou shalt perceive the
precepts which are therein. </P>
<P>Oh God of all things, who art my God, who in the beginning hast created all
things out of nothing, and hast reformed all things by the Holy Spirit; compleat
and restore my conscience, and heal my understanding, that I may glorify thee in
all my works, thoughts and words. And after thou hast said this Oration, make a
little respite the space of half an hour, and then say the third part of the
Oration, which follows: <I>Megal, Legal, Chariotos</I>, &amp;c. having said this
third part of the Oration, then meditate with thy self about the Scriptures thou
desirest to know; and then say this Oration: </P>
<P>Oh thou that art the Truth, Light, and Way, of all Creatures: Oh just God,
vivify me, and confirm my understanding, and restore my knowledge and conscience
unto me, as thou didst unto King <I>Solomon</I>, Amen. </P>
<P>Commemorating the parts according to that which is laid down, add the Oration
following: the other Orations being said, say the fourth part of the Oration,
which is this: <I>Amasiel, Danyi, hayr,</I> &amp;c. </P></FONT>
<H4>Then the parts being commemorated as is directed, add also the following
Oration.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>I speak these things in thy presence, Oh Lord my God, before whose face all
things are naked and open, that I being washed from the error of infidelity, thy
all-quicking Spirit may assist me, and take away all incredulity from me.
</P></FONT>
<H4>How the Latine Orations are not expounded by the words of the
Orations.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>We are therefore to know, that the whole Oration remaineth unexpounded;
because the words thereof are of so great subtilty, adorned with the Hebrew and
Chaldean Tongue, with the subtile and wonderful elocution of God: that the
office of the free exposition thereof, cannot possibly be transferred upon me.
The Latine words which are subjoyned to the parts of the Oration aforesaid, are
such words as have been translated out of the Chaldean Tongue: for they are not
the whole Oration; but as certain heads of every Oration pertaining thereunto.
</P></FONT>
<H4>Here he speaketh of the efficacy of all these.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>For this Oration is such a mystery, as King <I>Solomon</I> himself
witnesseth, that a Servant of his House having found this book by chance, and
being too much overcome with Wine in the Company of a Woman, he presumptuously
read it; but before he had finished a part thereof, he was stricken dumb, blind
and lame, and his Memory taken from him; so he continued to the day of his
death: and in the hour of his death, he spoke and said, that four Angels which
he had offended in presumptuous reading so sacred a mystery, were the daily
keepers and afflicters, one of his Memory, another of his speech, a third of his
sight, and the fourth of his hearing. </P>
<P>By which Testimony this Oration is so much commended by the same King
<I>Solomon</I>, and great is the mystery thereof: we do greatly require and
charge every one, that will say or read it, that he do it not presumptuously;
for in presumption is sin; wherefore let this Oration be said, according as is
directed. </P>
<P>We therefore hold it convenient and necessary, to speak something of the
general precepts of art, and of the knowledge of all arts; and of the several
precepts of every singular art: but because we have touched somthing of the
course of the Moon, it is necessary that we shew what her course signifies. The
Moon passeth through 12 signs in one Moneth; and the Sun through 12 signs in a
year; and in the same term and time, the Spirit inspireth, fructifieth and
illustrateth them; whence it is said, that the Sun and the Moon run their
course: it is understood the course which first they had. But because this is
wanting in the Hebrew, we thought good to omit it in the Latine, having spoken
sufficiently of the preceding Oration, and the three parts thereof. </P></FONT>
<H4>In this Chapter he sheweth the efficacy of the subsequent Oration, it being
special to obtain Eloquence.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>This Holy Oration which followeth, is a certain special Oration, to obtain
eloquence; whereas all others have virtue and efficacy in other things, this
containeth this certain special mystery in it self: And whereas one of the
generals is shewing in it self, certain general precepts, common to all arts for
so God instituted the soul in the body, saying, This I give unto you, that ye
may keep and observe the Law of the Lord; And these are they that stand in the
presence of God alwayes, and see their Saviour face to face night and day. So of
this Oration, I say, This is that most glorious, mystical and intelligible
Oration, containing such mysteries in it, which the mind, conscience and tongue
succeedeth. This is such a mystery, that a man shall keep it according to his
will, who foreseeth all things in his sight that are made; for the mystery of
this Oration is glorious and sacramental: let no man presume to say any of this
Oration after too much drinking or Luxury; nor fasting, without great reverence
and discretion. Whence <I>Solomon</I> saith, Let no man presume to treat any
thing of this Oration, but in certain determinate and appointed times, unless he
make mention of this Oration before some great President, for some weighty
business; for which this Oration is of wonderful excellent virtue. </P>
<P>The goodness of this Oration, and the attaining to the effects thereof, it is
read in that Psalm wherein it is said, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
men, as he said and did. </P>
<P>We know that it is not of our power, that this Oration is of so great Virtue,
and such a mystery, as sometimes also the Lord said to his disciples, This we
are not able to know: for this Oration is such a mystery, that it containeth in
it the great Name of God; which many have lyed in saying they knew it; for
<I>Jesus</I> himself performed many Miracles in the Temple by it: But many have
lyed about what he did, and have hid and absconded the truth thereof; so that
none have declared the same before it came to passe: but we suppose have spoken
somthing about or concerning it. </P></FONT>
<H4>In this chapter he setteth down the time and manner how this Oration is to
be pronounced.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>For this Oration is one of the generals, and the first of particulars,
containing both in it self; having a special virtue and faculty, to gain
Eloquence in it self: therefore it is necessary to be understood what time,
ordination, and what dayes it is to be said and published. </P>
<P>It may alwayes be rehearsed in every 14 Lunary as above said; but the
ordination of the time for every day, wherein it is to be said, is especially in
the morning betimes, before a man is defiled; and then all Orations are chiefly
to be said. And this Oration must be then pronounced totally together, without
any division. And although there are divisions therein, the Oration is not
divided in it self; but only the Divine and Glorious Names are written
severally, and are divided into parts, according to the terminations of every
great and Glorious Name; and it is to be said together as a most excellent Name,
but not as one Word, because of the fragility of our nature; Neither is it
needful to know the Elements of sillables, posited in this Oration; they are not
to be known; neither let any one presumptuously speak them; neither let him do
any thing by way of temptation, concerning this Oration, which ought not to be
done: <I>Elmot, Sehel, Hemech, Zaba,</I> &amp;c.<BR></P></FONT>
<H4>No man that is impedited or corrupted with any crime, ought to presume to
say this Oration.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>This is a thing agreed unto amongst the wise men of this World, that these
things, as we have said before, be pronounced with great reverence and industry:
it may be said every day, wherein thou art not hindred by some criminal sin; and
in that day wherein thou art impedited by some criminal sin, thou maist remember
it in thy heart; and if thou dost desire to be made Eloquent, repeat it three
times. And if any evil thing trouble thee, or thou art ermerged and involved
into any great business, repeat this Oration once, and Eloquence shall be added
to thee, as much as is needful; and if thou repeat it over twice, great
Eloquence shall be given to thee: so great a Sacrament is this Oration. </P>
<P>The third thing to be considered in this Oration, is; This Oration ought so
to be pronounced, that confession of the Heart and Mouth ought to precede it:
let it be pronounced in the morning early, and after that Oration say the Latine
Oration following.</P></FONT>
<H4>This is a Prologue or Exposition of the precedent Oration, which ought to be
said together.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Oh omnipotent and eternal God, and merciful Father, blessed before all
Worlds; who art a God eternal, incomprehensible, and unchangeable, and hast
granted this blessed gift of Salvation unto us; according to the omnipotency of
thy Majesty, hast granted unto us the faculty of speaking and learning, which
thou hast denyed to all other animals; and hast disposed of all things by thy
infallible providence: thou art God, whose nature is eternal and consubstantial,
exalted above the Heavens; in whom the whole Deity corporally dwells: I implore
thy Majesty, and Glorify thy omnipotency, with an intentive imploration, adoring
the mighty Virtue, Power and Magnificence of thy eternity. I beseech thee, Oh my
God, to grant me the inestimable Wisdome of the Life of thy holy Angels. Oh God
the Holy Spirit, incomprehensible, in whose presence stand the Holy quires of
Angels; I pray and beseech thee, by thy Holy and Glorious Name, and by the sight
of thy Angels, and the Heavenly Principalities, to give thy grace unto me, to be
present with mee, and give unto me power to persevere in the Memory of thy
Wisdome, who livest and reignest eternally one eternal God, through all worlds
of worlds; in whose sight are all celestial virtues, now and alwayes, and
everywhere, Amen. </P>
<P>This Oration being thus finished, there must of necessity some Mystery be
added; so that you are to be silent a while after the Latine Oration is ended:
and after a little taciturnity, that is, a little space of silence, begin to say
this Oration following seriously: <I>Semet, Lamen,</I> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This (saith <I>Solomon</I>) is the Oration of Orations, and a special
experiments, whereby all things, whether generals or particulars, are known
fully, efficaciously and perfectly, and are kept in the Memory. But when thou
hast by this Oration attained the Eloquence thou desirest, be sparing thereof,
and do not rashly declare those things which thy Tongue suggests and administers
to thee; for this is the end of all general precepts, which are given to obtain
Memory, Eloquence, and understanding. All those things which are before
delivered, of general precepts, are given as signs how the faculty of attaining
to the understanding of the general precepts may be had, which also
<I>Solomon</I> calleth Spirituals; and those singular arts have singular virtues
and powers. </P>
<P>Having now given a sufficient definition of general precepts; and the
Orations are laid down, and the Authority of the Orations unto what they are
designed; it is now necessary to set down what is to be done, concerning the
singular Orations; because we are now to treat of the several and particular
arts, that we may follow the example which our builder and Master hath laid
before us; for <I>Solomon</I> saith, before we proceed to the singular notes and
Orations of arts before noted, there ought to be said a <I>Præudium</I>, which
is a beginning or Prologue. </P></FONT>
<H4>How every several art hath its proper note.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Before we proceed to the singular precepts of several Arts, it is necessary
to discover how every several Art hath a several Note. </P></FONT>
<H4>Of the liberal Sciences and other things, which may be had by that
Art.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>The liberal Arts are seaven, and seaven exceptives, and seaven Mechanicks.
The seaven exceptives are comprehended under the seaven liberal: It is manifest
what the seaven liberal Arts are, of which we shall first treat. The Mechanicks
are these, which are adulteratedly called <I>Hydromancy, Pyromancy, Nigromancy,
Chiromancy, Geomancy, Geonegia,</I> which is comprehended under
<I>Astronomy</I>, and <I>Neogia</I>. </P><I>
<P>Hydromancy</I>, is a science of divining by the Water; whereby the Masters
thereof judged by the standing or running of the Water. <I>Pyromancy</I>, is an
experiment of divining by the flaming of the fire; which the ancient
Philosophers esteemed of great efficacy. <I>Nigromancy</I>, is a Sacrifice of
dead Animals, whereby the Ancients supposed to know many great Experiments
without sin, and to attain to great knowledge: from whence <I>Solomon</I>
commandeth that they might read seaven Books of that Art without sin; and that
two he accompted Sacriledge, and that they could nor: read two Books of that Art
without sin. But having spoken enough hereof, we proceed to the rest.

<H4>Of the liberal Sciences and other things which may be had thereby.</H4><FONT
size=2>
<P>There are seaven liberal Arts, which every one may learn and read without
sin. For Philosophy is great, containing profound Mysteries in it self: These
Arts are wonderfully known. </P></FONT>
<H4>He declareth what notes the three first liberal Arts have.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>For <I>Grammar</I> hath three notes only, <I>Dialects</I> two, and
<I>Rhetorick</I> four, and every one with open and distinct Orations. But
wherefore <I>Grammar</I> hath three, <I>Dialects</I> two, and <I>Rhetorick</I>
four; that we know King <I>Solomon</I> himself testifieth and affirmeth; for he
saith, And as I was admiring and revolving in my heart and mind, which way, from
whom and from whence was this science, An Angel brought one book, wherein was
written the Figures and Orations, and delivered unto me the Notes and Orations
of all Arts, plainly and openly, and told me of them all as much as was
necessary: And he explained unto me, as to a Child are taught by certain
Elements, some tedious Arts in a great space of time, how that I should have
these Arts in a short space of time: Saying unto me, So shalt thou be promoted
to every science by the increase of these virtues. And when I asked him, Lord,
whence and how cometh this? The Angel answered, This is a great Sacrament of the
Lord, and of his will: this writing is by the power of the Holy Ghost, which
inspireth, fructifieth and increaseth all knowledge; And again the Angel said,
Look upon these Notes and Orations, at the appointed and determinate times, and
observe the times as appointed of God, and no otherwise. When he had thus said
he shewed to King <I>Solomon</I> a book wherein was written, at what times all
these things were to be pronounced and published, and plainly demonstrated it
according to the Vision of God: Which things I having heard and seen, did
operate in them all, according to the Word of the Lord by the Angel: And so
<I>Solomon</I> declareth,it came to passe unto him: But we that come after him,
ought to imitate his Authority, and as much as we are able observe those things
he hath left unto us. </P></FONT><I>
<H4>Here</I> Solomon <I>sheweth, how the Angel told him distinctly, wherefore
the</I> Grammar <I>hath three Figures.</H4></I><FONT size=2>
<P>Behold wherefore the Grammatical Art hath only three Notes in the Book of
<I>Solomon Gemeliath</I>, that is, in The Book of the Art of God, which we read
is the Art of all other sciences, and of all other Arts; For <I>Solomon</I>
saith, When I did inquire every thing singularly of the Angel of God, with fear,
saying, Lord, from whence shall this come to passe to me, that I mayfully and
perfectly know this Art? Why do so many Notes appertain to such an Art, and so
many to such an Art, and are ascribed to several determinate Orations, to have
the efficacy thereof? The Angel is thus said to answer: The Grammatical Art is
called a liberal Art, And hath three things necessary thereunto: Ordination of
words and times; and in them, of Adjuncts or Figures; Simple, compound and
various; and a various declination of the parts to the parts, or a relation from
the parts, and a Congruent and ordinate division. This is the reason, why there
is three Notes in the Art of <I>Grammar</I>: And so it pleased the Divine
Wisdome, that as there should be a full knowledge of declining by one; by
another, there should be had a convenient Ordination of all the parts; by the
third, there should be had a continual and convenient Division of all the parts,
simple and compound. </P></FONT>
<H4>The Reason why the Dialectical Art hath two Figures onely.</H4><I><FONT
size=2>
<P>Dialect</I>, which is called the form of Arts, and a Doctrinal speech, hath
two things necessary thereunto, to wit, Eloquence of Arguing, and Prudence to
answer; Therefore the greatness of the Divine Providence and Piety, hath
appointed two Notes to it; that by the first, we may have Eloquence to Argue and
Dispute; and by the second, industry to answer without ambiguity: Wherefore
there are ascribed to <I>Grammar</I> three Notes, and to <I>Dialect</I> two
Notes. </P></FONT><I>
<H4>The Reason why</I> Rhetorick <I>hath four Figures.</H4></I><FONT size=2>
<P>Let us see wherefore <I>Rhetorick</I> hath four Notes. For there are four
things necessary therein; as the Angel of the Lord said unto <I>Solomon</I>; to
wit, a continual and flourishing adornment of locution, an ordinate, competent
and discreet judgement, a Testimony of Causes or Offices, of Chances &amp;
Losses, a composed disposition of buying and selling; An Eloquence of the
matters of that Art, with a demonstrative understanding. Therefore the greatness
of God hath appointed to the Art of <I>Rhetorick</I> four Notes, with their Holy
and Glorious Orations; as they were reverently sent by the Hand of God; that
every Note in this Art aforesaid, might have a several faculty, That the first
Note in that Art, might give a continual locution, a competent and flourishing
adornment thereof: The second, to discern Judgements, just and unjust, ordinate
and inordinate, true and false: The third, competently to discover offices and
causes: and the fourth giveth understanding and eloquence in all the operations
of this Art, without prolixity. See therefore how in <I>Grammar, Logick,</I> and
<I>Rhetorick</I>, the several Notes are disposed in the several Arts.
</P></FONT>
<H4>But of the other Arts and their Notes, we shall speak in their due place and
time, as we find them disposed in the book of the same <I>Solomon</I>.</H4><I>
<H4>At what timesand hours the Notes of these three liberal Arts are to be
looked into.</H4></I><FONT size=2>
<P>Now we proceed to shew at what time, and how the Notes of these Arts areto be
looked into, and the Orations to be said, to attain to these Arts. If thou art
altogether ignorant of the Grammatical Art, and wouldst have the knowledge
thereof: if it be appointed thee of God to do this work of works, and have a
firm understanding in this Art of Arts: Then know that thou maist not presume to
do otherwise than this book commandeth thee; for this book of his shall be thy
Master, And this Art of his thy Mistress. </P></FONT>
<H4>How the Grammatical Notes are to be looked into in the first Moon.</H4><FONT
size=2>
<P>For in this manner, the Grammaticall Notes are to be looked into, and the
Orations to be said. </P>
<P>In the dayes when the Moon is in her prime, the first Note is to be looked
into 12 times, and the Orations thereof repeated 24 times with Holy reverence;
making a little space between, let the Orations be twice repeated at the
inspection of every Note, and chiefly abstain from sins: do this from the first
day of the Moon to the 14, and from the 14 to the 17. The first and second Notes
are to be looked into 20 times, and the Orations to be repeated 30 times, on the
15 and 17 dayes, using some interval between them, All the three Notes are then
every dayto be looked into 12 times, and the Orations to be repeated 20 times:
and thus of the Notes of the Art of <I>Grammar</I>. But if thou hast read any
books of this Art, and desirest perfection therein, do as is commanded; using
the general Orations to increase Memory, Eloquence, understanding and
perseverance therein, repeating these above in the due time and hours appointed;
lest that going beyond thy precept, thou committest sin: but when thou dost
this, see that it be secret to thy self, and that thou have no looker on but
God. Now we come to the Notes. </P></FONT>
<H4>Here followeth the knowledge of the Notes.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>In the beginning of the inspection of all Notes, fast the first day till the
evening, if you can; if thou canst not, then take another hour. This is the
Grammatical precept.</P></FONT>
<H4>Of the logical notes.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>The Dialectical Notes may be used every day, except only in those dayes
before told of: The Rhetorical every day, except only three dayes of the Moneth,
to wit, <IMG alt=[Luna] src="">. 11, 17, and 19. And they are forbidden on these
dayes, as <I>Solomon</I> testifyes, the Notes of all Arts, except the Notes of
this Art are offered. These precepts are generally to be observed. </P></FONT>
<H4>How the Logical Notes are to be inspected, and the Orations thereof
said.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Know, that the Dialectical Notes are four times to be looked into, and the
Orations thereof in that day are 20 times to be repeated, making some respite,
and having the books of that Art before your Eyes; and so likewise the books of
Rhetorick, when the Notes thereof are inspected, as it is appointed. This
sufficeth for the knowledge of the 3 Arts. </P></FONT>
<H4>How we must beware of offences.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Before we proceed to begin the first Note of the Art of <I>Grammar,</I>
somthing is to be tryed before, that we may have the knowledge of the 1, 2, and
3 Notes. And you ought first to know, in what the Notes of the Grammatical,
Logical, or Rhetorical Art are to be inspected, it being necessary that your
greatest intentions be to keep from all offences. </P></FONT>
<H4>How the Notes ought to be inspected, at certain elected times.</H4><FONT
size=2>
<P>This is a special and manifest knowledge, wherewith the Notes of the
Grammatical Art are known: how they are to be published, at what times, and with
what distinction, is duly and competently manifest; it is spoken already of the
publishing and inspection of the Notes and Orations: now we shall digresse a
little to speak somthing of the times, it being in part done already.
</P></FONT>
<H4>How divers Months are to be sought out in the inspection of the
Notes.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>We have spoken already of the tearms of this Art, wherein the Orations are to
be read, and the Notes to be looked into: it remaineth to declare, how the
Lunations of these Orations are to be inspected and found out. But see that you
mistake not: yet I have already noted the Lunations, wherein the Notes ought to
be looked into, and the Orations rehearsed: But there are some Months, wherein
the Lunation is more profitable than others: if thou wouldst operate in Theology
or Astronomy, do it in a fiery sign; if Grammar or Logick, in Gemini or Virgo;
if Musick or Physick, in Taurus or Libra; if Rhetorick, Philosophy, Arithmetick
or Geometry, in Gemini or Cancer; for Mathematicks, in Taurus or Gemini: so they
are well placed, and free from evil; for all the Heavenly Potestates and Chorus
of Angels, do rejoyce in their Lunations, and determinate dayes. </P></FONT>
<H4>Here is made mention of the Notes of all Arts.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>I <I>Apollonius</I> following the power of <I>Solomon</I>, have disposed my
self to keep his works and observations, as it is spoken of the three Notes of
Grammar, so will I observe the times as they are to be observed: But the
Orations thereof are not written, but are more fully demonstrated in the
following work; for what is written of those three Notes, are not Orations, but
Definitions of those Notes, written by the Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldean, and
other things which are apprehended by us: For those writings which are not
understood in Latine, ought not to be pronounced, but on those dayes which are
appointed by King <I>Solomon</I>, and in those dayes wherein the Notes are
inspected, but on those dayes those Holy writings are alwayes to be repeated:
and the Latine, on those dayes wherein the Notes are not inspected. The Notes of
the Logical Art are two: and at what times they are to be published is already
shewn in part: more shall hereafter be said of them: now we come to the rest.
The Latine writings may be published, according to the Antiquity of the Hebrews,
except on those dayes we have spoken of: for <I>Solomon</I> saith, See that thou
perform all those precepts as they are given: But of the rest which follow, it
is to be done otherwise: for when thou seest the first Note of Logick, repeat in
thy heart the sign in the first Note, and so in the Notes of all Arts except
those whereof a definition shall be given. </P></FONT>
<H4>Definitions of several Arts, and the Notes thereof.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>We will give also Definitions of several Arts, as it is in the Book of
<I>Solomon</I>; Geometry hath one Note, Arithmetick a Note and a half;
Philosophy, with the Arts and Sciences contained therein, hath 7 Species;
Theology and Astronomy, with the Sciences in them contained, hath 7 Notes, but
they are great and dangerous; not great in the pronunciation, but have great
efficacy: Musick hath one Note, and Physick one Note; but they are all to be
published and rehearsed in their appointed dayes: But know, that in every day
wherein you beholdest the Notes of Theology, Philosophy, or of any Arts
contained in them, that thou neither laugh nor play, nor sport, because King
<I>Solomon</I>, when he saw the forms of these Notes, having over-drunk himself,
God was angry with him, and spoke unto him by his Angel, saying, Because thou
hast despised my Sacrament, and Polluted and derided my Holy things; <I>I will
take away part of thy Kingdome, and I will shorten the dayes of thy
Children.</I> And the Angel added, <I>The Lord hath forbid thee to enter into
the Temple 80 days, that thou maist repent of thy sin.</I> And when
<I>Solomon</I> wept and besought mercy of the Lord, the Angel answered, <I>Thy
dayes shall be prolonged; nevertheless many evills and iniquities shall come
upon thy Children, and they shall be destroyed of the iniquities that shall come
upon them.</I> </P>
<P>At the beginning of a Note, having seen the generals; let the specials be
looked into. The word of <I>Solomon</I> is to seek unto God for his promises,
before the Notes of the three Arts. </P></FONT>
<H4>The first Oration at the beginning of the Note.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>[1] The Light, Truth, Life, Way, Judge, Mercy, Fortitude and Patience,
preserve, help me, and have Mercy upon me, Amen. </P>
<P>This Oration, with the preceding, ought to be said in the beginning of the
first Note of Grammar. [2] Oh Lord, Holy Father, Almighty, eternal God, in whose
sight are all the foundations of all Creatures, and invisible beings, whose Eyes
behold my imperfections, of the sweetness of whose love the Earth and Heavens
are filled; who sawest all things before they were made, in whose book every day
is formed, and all mankind are written therein: behold me thy Servant this day
prostrate before thee, with my whole Heart and Soul, by thy Holy Spirit confirm
me, blesse me, protect all my Actions in this inspection or repetition, and
illuminate me with the constancy of thy visitation. </P>
<P>The 3 Oration. This Oration ought to be said before the second Note of
Grammar. [3] Behold, O Lord, merciful Father of all things; eternal dispensor of
all virtues, and consider my operations this day; Thou art the Beholder and
Discerner of all the Actions of Men and Angels: Let the wonderful grace of thy
promises condescend to fulfil this sudden virtue in me, and infuse such efficacy
into me, operating in thy Holy and great Name, thou who infusest thy praise into
the mouths of them that love thee, Amen. </P>
<P>The 4 Oration. Let this Oration be rehearsed before the third Grammatical
Note: [4] <I>O Adonay,</I> Creator of all visible Creatures! <I>Oh most Holy
Father, who dwellest incompassed about with eternal light, disposing and by thy
power governing all things before all beginnings; I most humbly beseech thy
eternity and thy incomprehensible goodness may come to perfection in me, by the
operation of thy most Holy Angels; And be confirmed in my Memory, and establish
these thy Holy works in me,</I> Amen. </P>
<P>A little space after this Oration, say the following: the first Oration ought
to be said before the first Note of Logick. [5] <I>Oh Holy God, great good, and
the eternal Maker of all things, thy Attributes not to be exprest, who hast
Created the Heaven and the Earth, the Sea and all things in them, and the
bottomless pit, according to thy pleasure; in whose sight are the Words and
Actions of all men: Grant unto me, by these Sacramental Mysteries of thy Holy
Angels, the precious knowledge of this art, which I desire by the Ministry of
thy Holy Angels, it being without any Malignant or Malitious intent,</I> Amen.
</P></FONT>
<H4>Pronounce this Oration in the beginning of the first Figure of the Logick
art; and after this Oration rehearse incontinently with some interval, the
Orations written between the first Figure.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>The 6 Oration ought to be said before the first Note of the Dialect. [6]
<I>Helay: Most Merciful Creator, Inspirer, Reformer, and Approver of all Divine
wills, Ordeyner of all things, Mercifully give ear to my Prayer, gloriously
intend unto the desires of my heart, that what I humbly desire, according to thy
promises, thou wilt Mercifully grant,</I> Amen.</P>
<P>This Oration following, ought to be pronounced before the first Note of the
Rhetorical Art. [7] Omnipotent and merciful Father, Ordeyner and Creator of all
Creatures: <I>Oh most Holy Judge, eternal King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; who
wonderfully condescendest to give wisdome and understanding to thy Saints, who
judgest and discernest all things: I beseech thee to illuminate my heart this
day with the Splendor of thy Beauty, that I may understand and know what I
desire, and what things are considerable to be known in this Art,</I> Amen. </P>
<P>This Oration with the following <I>Hanazay</I>, &amp;c. ought to be
pronounced before the first Figure of Rhetorick: and although the Oration is
divided into two parts, yet it is one and the same: And they are divided only
for this cause, that there might be some mean interval used in the pronouncing
of them; and they ought to be pronounced before the other Orations written in
the Figure. </P><I>
<P>Hanazay, Sazhaon, Hubi, Sene, Hay, Ginbar, Ronail, Selmora, Hyramay, Lohal,
Yzazamael, Amathomatois, Yaboageyors, Sozomcrat, Ampho, Delmedos, Geroch,
Agalos, Meihatagiel, Secamai, Saheleton, Mechogrisces, Lerirencrhon.</I> </P>
<P>The 8 Oration, let it be pronounced before the second Note of the Rhetorical
Art: [8] <I>Oh great eternal and wonderful Lord God, who of thy eternal counsel
hast disposed of all virtues, and art Ordeyner of all goodness; Adorn and
Beautify my understanding, and give unto me Reason to know and learn the
Mysteries of thy Holy Angels: And grant unto me all knowledge and learning thou
hast promised to thy Servants by the vertue of thy holy Angels,</I> Amen. </P>
<P>This Oration, with the other two following, ought to be pronounced, (<I>viz.
Vision,</I> &amp;c.) <I>Azelechias</I>, &amp;c. in the beginning of the second
Figure of Rhetorick, and before the other Orations; and there ought to be some
interval between them. </P>
<P>Let this Oration following be said, before the second Note of Rhetorick [9]
<I>Vision</I>; beholding with thy eternal conspiration all Powers, Kingdomes and
Judges, Administring all manner of Languages to all, and of whose power there is
no end; restore I beseech thee and increase my Memory, my heart and
understanding, to know, understand, and judge all things which thy Divine
authority commendeth necessary in this art, perfectly fulfill them in me, Amen.
</P>
<P>Let this Oration following, with the Precedent, be rehearsed before the
second Note of Rhetorick. [10] <I>Azelechias, Velozeos, Inoanzama, Samelo,
Hotens, Sagnath, Adonay, Soma, Jezochos, Hicon, Jezomethon, Sadaot.</I> And thou
Oh God propitiously confirm thy promises in me, as thou hast confirmed them by
the same words to King <I>Solomon</I>; send unto me, Oh Lord, thy virtue from
Heaven, that may illuminate my mind and understanding: strengthen, Oh God, my
understanding, renew my Soul within me, and wash me with the Waters which are
above the Heavens; pour out thy Spirit upon my flesh, and fill my bowels with
thy Judgements, with humility and charity: thou who hast created the Heaven and
the Earth, and made man according to thy own Image; pour out the light of thy
love into my understanding, that being radicated and established in thy love and
thy mercy, I may love thy Name, and know, and worship thee, and understand all
thy Scriptures, And all the Mysteries which thou hast declared by thy Holy
Angels, I may receive and understand in my heart, and use this Art to thy Honor
and Glory, through thy mighty Counsel, Amen. </P>
<P>The 11 Oration ought to be said before the pronounciation of the third Note
of Rhetorick. [11] I know, that I love thy Glory, and my delight is in thy
wonderful works, and that thou wilt give unto me wisdome, according to thy
goodness and thy power, which is incomprehensible: <I>Theon, Haltanagon,
Haramalon, Zamoyma, Chamasal, Jeconamril, Harionatar, Jechomagol, Gela Magos,
Kemolihot, Kamanatar, Hariomolatar, Hanaces, Velonionathar, Azoroy,
Jezabali;</I> by these most Holy and Glorious profound Mysteries, precious
Offices, virtue and knowledge of God, compleat and perfect my beginnings, and
reform my beginnings, <I>Zembar, Henoranat, Grenatayl, Samzatam, Jecornazay:</I>
Oh thou great Fountain of all goodness, knowledge and virtue, give unto thy
Servant power to eschew all evill, and cleave unto goodness and knowledge, and
to follow the same with an Holy intention, that with my whole heart I may
understand &amp; learn thy Laws and Decrees; especially these Holy Mysteries;
wherein that I may profit, I beseech thee, Amen. </P>
<P>12. This Oration ought to be said before the ninth Rhetorical Note: <I>Oh
most reverend Almighty Lord, ruling all Creatures both Angels and Arch-Angels,
and all Celestial, terrestrial, and infernal Creatures; of whose greatness comes
all plenty, who hast made man after thy own Image; Grant unto me the knowledge
of this Art, and strengthen all Sciences in me,</I> Amen. </P>
<P>13. Pronounce this before the first Figure of Arithmetick: <I>Oh God who
numbrest, weighest, and measurest all things, given the day his order, and
called the Sun by his Name; Grant the knowledge of this Art unto my
understanding, that I may love thee, and acknowledge the gift of thy
goodness,</I> Amen.</P>
<P>14. Say this before the semi-note of Arithmetick: <I>Oh God, the Operator of
all things, from whom proceeds every good and perfect gift; sow the Seeds of thy
Word in my Heart, that I may understand the excellent Mysteries of this Art,</I>
Amen. </P>
<P>15. Say this before the second Figure of Arithmetick: <I>Oh God the perfect
Judge of all good works, who makest known thy saving goodness amongst all
Nations; open my Eyes and my Heart, with the beams of thy mercy, that I may
understand and persevere in these thy Heavenly Mysteries,</I> Amen. </P>
<P>16. This Oration before the second Note of Geometry: <I>Oh God the giver of
all wisdome and knowledge to them that are without sin, Instructor and Master of
all Spiritual Learning, by thy Angels and Arch-Angels, by Thrones, Potestates,
Principates and Powers, by Cherubim and Seraphim, and by the 24 Elders, by the 4
Animals, and all the host of Heaven, I adore, invocate, worship and glorify thy
Name, and exalt thee: most terrible and most merciful, I do humbly beseech thee
this day to illuminate and fill my Heart with the grace of thy Holy Spirit, thou
who art three in one,</I> Amen. </P>
<P>17. Say this Oration before the second Note of Theology. <I>I adore thee, Oh
King of Kings, my light, my substance, my life, my King, and my God, my Memory,
and my strength; who in a Moment gavest sundry Tongues, and threwest down a
Mighty Tower, And gavest by thy Holy Spirit the knowledge of Tongues to thy
Apostles, infusing thy knowledge into them in a Moment, giving them the
understanding of all Languages: inspire my Heart, and pour the dew of thy grace
and Holy Spirit into me, that I may understand the Exposition of Tongues and
Languages,</I> Amen. </P></FONT>
<H4>Three Chapters to be published, before any of the Notes.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>What we have spoken of the three first Chap. are generally and specially to
be pronounced, so that you say them, and the Orations on the dayes appointed,
and work by the Notes as it is demonstrated to you. These Orations ought to be
said alwayes before noon, every day of the Moneth; and before the Notes say the
proper Orations: and in all reading, observe the precepts commanded. </P></FONT>
<H4>How the Proper Notes are to be inspected.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>If you would learn anything of any one Art, look into the proper Notes
thereof in their due time. Enough is said already of the three liberal Arts.
</P></FONT>
<H4>What dayes are to be observed in the inspection of the Notes of the four
Arts.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>In the four other Arts, only the four first dayes are to be observed: The
Philosophical Notes, with all Sciences contained therein, the 7 and 17 dayes of
the Moon are to be inspected, 7 times aday, with their several Orations. The
Note is to be looked into, with fear, silence and trembling. </P>
<P>Of the Notes of the liberal Arts, it is spoken already; but only know this,
that when you would use them, live chaste and soberly; for the Note hath in it
self 24 Angels, is fully and perfectly to be pronounced, as you have heard: but
when you look into them, repeat all the Theological Orations, and the rest in
their due time. </P></FONT>
<H4>Of the inspection of general Notes.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Say the general Notes 10 times a day, when you have occasion to use any
common Arts, having the books of those Arts before you, using some interval or
space of time between them, as you have been taught already. </P></FONT>
<H4>How the three first Chapters are to be pronounced before Orations.</H4><FONT
size=2>
<P>To have perfection herein, know, that in the general pronunciation of
Orations, the Notes of the three heads are to be rehearsed; whether the Orations
be pronounced or not. </P></FONT>
<H4>How the fifth Oration of Theology ought to be rehearsed upon these
Orations.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>There is also somthing else to be said of the four other liberal Arts; if you
would have the perfect knowledge of them, make the first Oration of Theology
before you say the Orations of the other Notes. These are sufficiently declared,
that you may understand and know them; And let the capitular Orations be
pronounced before the several Notes of every Art, and kept as is determined,
<I>&amp;c.</I> These are the Augmentations of the Orations, which belong to all
Arts liberal and exceptive, except <I>Mechanick</I>, and are especially ascribed
to the Notes of Theology. And they are thus to be pronounced, that whensoever
you would look into any one Note of any Art, and would profit therein, say these
Orations following. <BR><BR>1. <I>Ezomamos, Hazalat, Ezityne, Hezemechel,
Czemomechel, Zamay, Zaton, Ziamy Nayzaton, Hyzemogoy, Jeccomantha, Jaraphy,
Phalezeton, Sacramphal, Sagamazaim, Secranale, Sacramathan; Jezennalaton
Hacheriatos, Jetelemathon, Zaymazay, Zamaihay, Gigutheio Geurlagon, Garyos,
Megalon Hera Cruhic, Crarihuc</I>, Amen. </P>
<P>Let this Oration with the following be pronounced before the first Note of
Philosophy: Oh Lord God, holy Father, almighty and incomprehensible; hear my
Prayers, thou that art invisible, immortal and intelligible, whose face the
Angels and Arch-angels, and all the powers of Heaven, do so much desire to see;
whose Majesty I desire eternally to adore, and honour the only one God for ever
and ever, <I>Amen.</I> </P>
<P>2. Say this before the second Note of Philosophy: Oh Lord God, Holy and
Almighty Father, hear my Prayers this day, and incline thy ears to my Orations;
<I>Gezomelion Samach, Semath, Cemon, Gezagam, Gezatrhin, Zheamoth, Zeze Hator
Sezeator Samay Sarnanda, Gezyel, Iezel, Gaziety, Hel, Gazayethyhel,</I> Amen.
</P>
<P>Say this following with the former: Oh God eternal, the way, the truth, and
the life; give thy light and the flower of thy Holy Spirit into my mind and
understanding, and grant that the gift of thy grace may shine forth in my heart,
and into my Soul, now and for ever, <I>Amen.</I> </P>
<P>Pronounce the Oration following before the third Note of Philosophy;
<I>Lemogethom, Hegemochom, Hazachay Hazatha, Azamachar, Azacham, Cohathay.
Geomothay Logomothay, Zathana, Lachanma, Legomezon, Legornozon, Lembdemachon,

<P>Say this following with the precedent Oration: Oh God the life of all visible
Creatures, eternal brightness, and virtue of all things; who art the original of
all piety, who knewest all things before the were; who judgest all things, and
discernest all things by thy unspeakeable knowledge: glorify thy Holy and
unspeakable Name this day in my heart, and strengthen my intellectual
understanding; increase my Memory, and confirm my eloquence; make my Tongue
ready, quick, and perfect in thy Sciences and Scriptures, that by thy power
given unto me, and thy wisdome taught in my heart, I may praise thee, and know
and understand thy Holy Name for ever World without end, <I>Amen.</I> </P>
<P>Say this Oration following before the fourth Note of Philosophy. Oh King of
Kings, the Giver and Dispenser of infinite Majesty, and of infinite mercy, the
founder of all foundations; lay the foundation of all thy virtues in me, remove
all foolishness from my heart, that my senses may be established in the love of
thy charity, and my Spirit informed by thee, according to there creation and
invocation of they will, who livest and reignest God throughout all Worlds of
Worlds, Amen. </P></FONT>
<H4>How these Orations are to be said every day once before the general Notes,
and the Notes of the liberal Arts.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>These 4 Orations are necessary for liberal Arts, but chiefly do appertain to
Theology, which are to be said everyday before the general Notes, or the Notes
of the liberal Arts; but to Theology say every one of these 7 times to every
Note; but if you would learn or teach any thing of dictating, versifying,
singing or Musick, or any of these Sciences, first teach him these Orations,
that thou would'st teach, how he should read them: but if he be a Child of mean
understanding, read them before him, and let him say after thee word for word;
but if he be of a good understanding, let him read them 7 times a day for 7
dayes: or if it be a general Note, pronounce these Orations, and the Virtue
thereof shall profit you much, and you shall therein find great virtue. </P><I>
<P>Solomon</I> saith of these Orations, let no man presume to make use of them
unless for the proper office they are instituted for. Oh Father,
incomprehensible, from whom proceedeth every thing that is good; whose greatness
is incomprehensible: Hear this day my Prayers, which I make in thy sight, and
grant to me the Joy of thy saving health, that I may teach unto the wicked the
Wayes and Paths of thy Sciences, and convert the Rebellious and incredulous unto
thee, that whatsoever I commemorate and repeat in my heart and mouth, may take
root and foundation in me; that I may be made powerful and efficacious in thy
works, <I>Amen</I>. </P>
<P>Say this Oration before the 6 Note of Philosophy: <I>Gezemothon, Oromathian,
Hayatha, Aygyay, Lethasihel, Lechizliel, Gegohay, Gerhonay, Samasatel,
Samasathel, Gessiomo, Hatel, Segomasay, Azomathon, Helomathon, Gerochor,
Hejazay, Samin, Heliel, Sanihelyel, Siloth, Silerech, Garamathal, Gesemathal,
Gecoromay, Gecorenay, Samyel, Samihahel, Hesemyhel, Sedolamax, Secothamay,
Samya, Rabiathos, Avinosch, Annas,</I> Amen. </P>
<P>Then say this following: Oh eternal King! O God, the Judge and discerner of
all things, knower of all good Sciences; instruct me this day for thy Holy Names
sake, and by these Holy Sacraments; and purify my understanding, that thy
knowledge may enter into my inward parts, as water flowing from Heaven, and as
Oil into my bones, by thee, Oh God Saviour of all things, who art the Fountain
of goodness, and original of piety; instruct me this day in those Sciences which
I desire, thou who art one God for ever, <I>Amen.</I> Oh God Father,
incomprehensible, from whom proceedeth all good, the greatness of whose mercy is
fathomless, hear my Prayers, which I make this day before thee, and render unto
me the joy of thy Salvation, that I may teach the unjust the knowledge of thy
wayes, and convert the unbelieving and Rebellious unto thee; and may have power
to perform thy works, <I>Amen</I>. </P></FONT>
<H4>The 7 Oration, which is the end of the Orations, belonging to the ineffable
Note, the last of Theology, having 24 Angels.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Oh God of all piety, Author and Foundation of all things, the eternal Health
and Redemption of thy people; Inspirer and great Giver of all graces, Sciences
and Arts, from whose gift it cometh: Inspire into me thy servant, an increase of
those Sciences: who hast granted life to me miserable sinner, defend my Soul,
and deliver my Heart from the wicked cogitations of this World; extinguish and
quench in me the flames of all lust and fornication, that I may the more
attentively delight in thy Sciences and Arts; and give unto me the desire of my
Heart, that I being confirmed and exalted in thy glory, may love thee: and
increase in me the power of thy Holy Spirit, by thy Salvation and reward of the
faithful, to the Salvation of my Soul and Body, <I>Amen</I>. </P>
<P>Then say this following: Oh God most mighty Father, from whom proceedeth all
good, the greatness of whose mercy is incomprehensible; hear my Prayers, which I
make in thy sight.</P></FONT>
<H4>Special precepts of the Notes of Theology, chiefly of the 1. 2. and
3.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>These 7 Orations are an augmentation of the rest, and ought to be said before
all the Notes of Theology, but especially before the ineffable Note; these are
the precepts to make thee sufficient, which we command thee to observe by the
authority of <I>Solomon</I>: diligently inquire them out, and do as we have
proposed, and perfectly pronounce the Orations, and look into the Notes of the
other Arts. </P></FONT><I>
<H4>How</I> Solomon <I>received that ineffable Note from the
Angel.</H4></I><FONT size=2>
<P>Because thou desirest the Mystery of the Notes, take this of the ineffable
Note, the expression whereof is given in the Angels by the Figures of Swords,
birds, trees, Flowers, Candles, and Serpents; For <I>Solomon</I> received this
from the Lord in the night of Pacification, ingraven in a book of Gold; and
heard this from the Lord: Doubt not, neither be affraid; for this Sacrament is
greater than all the rest; And the Lord joyned it unto him, When thou look'st
into this Note, and read'st the Orations thereof, observe the precepts before,
and diligently look into them; And beware that thou prudently conceal and keep
whatsoever thou read'st in this Note of God, and whatsoever shall be revealed to
thee in the vision. And when the Angel of the Lord appeareth to thee, keep and
conceal the words and writings he revealeth to thee; and observe them to
practice and operate in them, observing all things with great reverence, and
pronounce them at the appointed dayes and hours, as before is directed: and
afterwards say: <I>Sapienter die illo; Age, &amp; caste vivas.</I> But if thou
dost anything uncertain, there is danger; as then wilt have experience from the
other Notes and the Orations of them; but consider that which is most wonderful
in those Orations; for these words are ineffable Names, and are spiritually to
be pronounced before the ineffable Note, <I>Hosel, Jesel, Anchiator, Aratol,
Hasiatol, Gemor, Gesameor.</I> Those are the Orations which ought to be
pronounced after the inspection of all Arts, and after the Note of Theology.
</P>
<P>This is the fulfilling of the whole work; but what is necessary for an
experiment of the work, we will more plainly declare. In the beginning of the
knowledge of all Art, there is given almost the perfect doctrine of operating: I
say almost, because some flourishing institutions hereof remain, whereof this is
the first beginning. </P></FONT>
<H4>How the precepts are to be observed in the operation of all Arts.</H4><FONT
size=2>
<P>Observe the 4 <IMG alt=[lunam] src="">in every operation of Theology. Exhibit
that operation with efficacy every 4 <IMG alt=[Luna] src=""><I>quartam
lunam</I>; and diligently look into the books and writings of those Arts; if
thou doubt of any of the Chapters, they are to be pronounced, as is taught of
the superiour Chapters; but know this, that these Holy Words of Orations, we
appoint to be said before the bed of the sick, for an experiment of life or
death. And this thou maist do often, if thou wilt operate nothing else in the
whole body of Art: And know this, that if thou hast not the books in thy hands,
or the faculty of looking into them is not given to thee; the effect of this
work will not be the lesse therefore: but the Orations are twice then to be
pronounced, where they were to be but once: And as to the knowledge of a vision,
and the other virtues which these holy Orations have; thou maist prove and try
them, when and how thou wilt.</P></FONT>
<H4>These precepts are specially to be observed.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>But when thou would'st operate in Theology, observe only those dayes which
are appointed; but all times are convenient for those Notes and Operations, for
which there is a competent time given; but in the pronounciation of the three
liberal Arts, or in the inspection of their Notes, perhaps thou maist pretermit
some day appointed, if thou observe the rest; or if thou transgress two dayes,
leave not off the work, for it loseth not its effect for this, for the Moon is
more to be observed in the greater numbers than the dayes or hours. For
<I>Solomon</I> saith, if thou miss a day or two, fear not, but operate on the
general Chapters. This is enough to say of them: but by no means forget any of
the words which are to be said in the beginning of the reading to attain to
Arts; for there is great virtue in them. And thou maist frequently use the Holy
Words of the visions: but if thou wouldst operate in the whole body of the
Physical Art, the first Chapters are first to be repeated as before are defined.
And in Theology, thou must operate only by thy self: Often repeat the Orations,
and look into the Notes of Theology: this produceth great effects. It is
necessary that thou have the Note of the 24 Angels alwayes in Memory; and
faithfully keep those things, which the Angel reveales to thee in the vision.
</P></FONT><I>
<H4>The Experiment of the precedent work, is the beginning of the following
Orations, which</I> Solomon <I>calleth</I> Artem Novam.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>These Orations may be said before all Arts generally, and before all Notes
specially; And they may be pronounced without any other Chapters, if thou
wouldst operate in any of the aforesaid Arts, saying these Orations in due time
and order; thou maist have great efficacy in any Art. And in saying these
Orations, neither the time, day, nor <IMG alt=[Moon] src="">, are to be
observed: but take heed, that on these dayes you abstain from all sin, as
drunkenness, gluttony, especially swearing, before you proceed thereunto, that
your knowledge therein may be the more cleer and perfect. </P>
<P>Wherefore <I>Solomon</I> saith, When I was to pronounce these Orations, I
feared lest I should offend God; and I appointed unto my self a time wherein to
begin them; that living chastly, I might appear the more innocent. </P>
<P>These are the Proaemiums of these Orations, that I might lay down in order
every thing whereof thou maist doubt, without any other definition. And before
thou begin to try any of these subtile works, it is good to fast two or three
dayes; that it may be divinely revealed, whether thy desires be good or evil.
</P>
<P>These are the precepts appointed before every operation; but if thou doubt of
any beginning, either of the three first Chapters, or of the four subsequent
Arts, that thou maist have the effect of perfect knowledge; if thou consider and
pronounce the Orations, as they are above described, although thou overpass
somthing ignorantly; thou maist be reconciled by the spiritual virtue of the
subsequent Orations. </P>
<P>The Angel said of these Orations to <I>Solomon</I>: See the holiness of these
Orations; and if thou hast transgrest any therein presumptuously or ignorantly,
say reverently and wisely these Orations, of which the great Angel saith: This
is a great sacrament of God, which the Lord sendeth to thee by my hand; at the
veneration of which sacrament, when King <I>Solomon</I> offered with great
patience before the Lord upon the Altar, he saw the book covered with fine
linen, and in this book were written 10 Orations, and upon every Oration the
sign of golden Seal: and he heard in his Spirit, These are they which the Lord
hath figured, and are far excluded from the hearts of the unfaithful. </P>
<P>Therefore <I>Solomon</I> trembled lest he should offend the Lord, and kept
them, saying it was wickedness to reveal them to unbelievers: but he that would
learn any great or spiritual thing in any Art or necessary Science, if he cannot
have a higher work, he may say these Orations at what time soever he will; the
three first, for the three first liberal Arts; a several Oration for every
several Art, or generally all the three for the three Arts are to be said; and
in like manner the four subsequent Orations, for four other liberal Arts. And if
thou wouldst have the whole body of Art, without any definition of time, thou
maist pronounce these Orations before the several Arts, and before the Orations
and Notes of these Arts, as often as thou wilt, fully, manifestly and secretly;
but beware that thou live chastly and soberly in the pronounciation thereof.
</P>
<P>This is the first Oration of the 10, which may be pronounced by its self,
without any precedent work to acquire Memory, Eloquence and understanding, and
stableness of these three and singularly to be rehearsed before the first figure
of Theology: Omnipotent, Incomprehensible, invisible and indissolvable Lord God;
I adore this day thy Holy Name; I an unworthy and miserable sinner, do lift up
my Prayer, understanding and reason towards thy Holy and Heavenly Temple,
declaring thee, Oh Lord God, to be my Creator and Saviour: and I a rational
Creature do this day invocate thy most glorious clemency, that thy Holy Spirit
may vivify my infirmity: And thou, Oh my God, who didst confer the Elements of
letters, and efficacious Doctrine of thy Tongue to thy Servants <I>Moses</I> and
<I>Aaron</I>, confer the same grace of thy sweetness upon me, which thou hast
investigated into thy Servants and Prophets: as thou hast given them learning in
a moment, confer the same learning upon me, and cleanse my Conscience from dead
works; direct my Heart into the right way, and open the same to understand, and
drop the truth into my understanding. And thou, Oh Lord God, who didst
condescend to create me after thy own image, hear me in thy Justice, and teach
me in thy truth, and fill up my soul with thy knowledge according to thy great
mercy, that in the multitude of thy mercies, thou maist love me the more, and
the greater in thy works, and that I may delight in the administration of thy
Commandments; that I being helped and restored by the work of thy grace, and
purified in Heart and Conscience to trust in thee, I may feast in thy sight, and
exalt thy name, for it is good, before thy Saints, Sanctifie me this day, that I
may live in faith, perfect in hope, and constant in charity, and may learn and
obtain the knowledge I desire; and being illuminated, strengthened, and exalted
by the Science obtained, I may know thee, and love thee, and love the knowledge
and wisdome of thy Scriptures; and that I may understand and firmly retain, that
which thou hast permitted man to know: Oh Lord Jesus Christ, eternal only
begotten Son of God, into whose hands the Father gave all things before all
Worlds, give unto me this day, for thy Holy and glorious Name, the unspeakable
nutriment of Soul and Body, a fit, fluent, free and perfect Tongue; and that
whatsoever I shall ask in thy mercy, will and truth, I may obtain; and confirm
all my Prayers and actions, according to thy good pleasure. Oh Lord my God, the
Father of Life, open the Fountain of Sciences, which I desire; open to me, Oh
Lord, the Fountain which thou openedst to <I>Adam</I>, and to thy Servants
<I>Abraham</I>, and <I>Isaac</I>, and <I>Jacob</I>, to understand, learn and
judge; receive Oh Lord my Prayers, through all thy Heavenly virtues,
<I>Amen</I>. </P>
<P>The next Oration is the second of ten, and giveth Eloquence, which ought to
be said after the other; a little interval between, and before the first Figure
of Theology. </P>
<P>I adore thee, thou King of Kings, and Lords, eternal and unchangeable King:
Hearken this day to the cry and sighing of my Heart and Spirit, that thou maist
change my understanding, and give to me a heart of flesh, for my heart of stone,
that I may breath before my Lord and Saviour; and wash Oh Lord with thy new
Spirit the inward parts of my heart, and wash away the evil of my flesh: infuse
into me a good understanding, that I may become a new man; reform me in thy
love, and let thy salvation give me increase of knowledge: hear my Prayers, O
Lord, wherewith I cry unto thee, and open the Eyes of my flesh, and
understanding, to understand the wonderful things of thy Law; that being
vivified by thy Justification, I may prevail against the Devil, the adversary of
the faithful; hear me Oh Lord my God, and be merciful unto me, and shew me thy
mercy; and reach to me the vessel of Salvation, that I may drink and be
satisfied of the Fountain of thy grace, that I may obtain the knowledge and
understanding; and let the grace of thy Holy Spirit come, and rest upon me,
<I>Amen</I>.</P></FONT>
<H4>For Eloquence and stability of mind.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>This is the third Oration of the ten, and is to be said before the first
Figure of Astronomy. </P>
<P>I confesse my self guilty this day before thee Oh God, Father of Heaven and
Earth, Maker of all things, visible and invisible, of all Creatures, Dispenser
and Giver of all grace and virtue; who hidest wisdome and knowledge from the
proud and wicked, and givest it to the faithful and humble; illuminate my Heart,
and establish my Conscience and understanding: set the light of thy countenance
upon me, that I may love thee, and be established in the knowledge of my
understanding, that I being cleansed from evil works, may attain to the
knowledge of those Sciences, which thou hast reserved for believers. Oh merciful
and omnipotent God, cleanse my Heart and reins, strengthen my Soul and Senses
with the grace of thy Holy Spirit, and establish me with the fire of the same
grace: illuminate me; gird up my loyns, and give the staffe of thy Consolation
into my right hand, direct me in thy Doctrine, root out of me all vices and sin,
and comfort me in the love of thy mercies: Breath into me Oh Lord the breath of
Life, and increase my reason and understanding; send thy Holy Spirit into me,
that I may be perfect in all knowledge: behold Oh Lord, and consider the dolour
of my mind, that my will may be comforted in thee; send into me from Heaven thy
Holy Spirit, that I may understand those things I desire. Give unto me
invention, Oh Lord, thou Fountain of perfect reason and riches of knowledge,
that I may obtain wisdom by thy Divine assistance, <I>Amen</I>.</P></FONT>
<H4>To Comfort the outward and inward Senses.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Oh Holy God, mercyful and omnipotent Father, Giver of all things; strengthen
me by thy power, and help me by thy presence, as thou wert mercyful to
<I>Adam</I>, and suddenly gavest him the knowledge of all Arts through thy great
mercy; grant unto me power to obtain the same knowledge by the same mercy: be
present with me Oh Lord, and instruct me: Oh most mercyful Lord Jesus Christ Son
of God, breath thy Holy Spirit into me, proceeding from thee and the Father;
strengthen my work this day, and teach me, that I may walk in thy knowledge, and
glorify the abundance of thy grace: Let the flames of thy Holy Spirit rejoyce
the City of my Heart, by breathing into me thy Divine Scriptures; replenish my
Heart with all Eloquence, and vivify me with thy Holy visitation; blot out of me
the spots of all vices, I beseech thee, Oh Lord God incomprehensible; let thy
grace alwayes rest upon me, and be increased in me; heal my Soul by thy
inestimable goodness, and comfort my heart all my life, that what I hear I may
understand, and what I understand I may keep, and retain in my Memory; give me a
teachable Heart and Tongue; through thy inexhaustible grace and goodness; and
the grace of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, <I>Amen</I>.</P></FONT>
<H4>This following is for the Memory.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>O Holy Father, merciful Son, and Holy Ghost, inestimable King; I adore,
invocate, and beseech thy Holy Name, that of thy overflowing goodness, thou wilt
forget all my sins: be mercyful to me a sinner, presuming to go about this
office of knowledge, and occult learning; and grant, Oh Lord, it may be
efficatious in me; open Oh Lord my ears , that I may hear; and take away the
scales from my Eyes, that I may see: strengthen my hands, that I may work; open
my face, that I may understand thy will; to the glory of thy Name, which is
blessed for ever, <I>Amen</I>.</P></FONT>
<H4>This following strengtheneth the interiour and exteriour Sences.</H4><FONT
size=2>
<P>Lift up the senses of my Heart and Soul unto thee, Oh Lord my God, and
elevate my heart this day unto thee; that my words and works may please thee in
the sight of all people; let thy mercy and omnipotency shine in my bowels; let
my understanding be enlarged, and let thy Holy Eloquence be sweet in my mouth,
that what I read or hear I may understand and repeat: as <I>Adam</I> understood,
and as <I>Abraham</I> kept, so let me keep understanding; and as <I>Jacob</I>
was founded and rooted in thy wisedome , so let me be: let the foundation of thy
mercy be confirmed in me, that I may delight in the works of thy hands, and
persevere in Justice, and peace of Soul and Body; the grace of thy Holy Spirit
working in me, that I may rejoyce in the overthrow of all my adversaryes,
<I>Amen</I>. </P></FONT>
<H4>This following giveth Eloquence, Memory and Stability.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Disposer of all Kingdomes , and of all visible and invisible gifts: Oh God,
the Ordeyner and Ruler of all wills, by the Counsel of thy Spirit dispose and
vivify the weakness of my understanding, that I may burn in the accesse of thy
Holy will to good: do good to me in thy good pleasure, not looking upon my sins;
grant me my desire, though unworthy; confirm my Memory and reason to know,
understand, and retain, and give good effect to my senses through thy grace, and
justify me with the justification of thy Holy Spirit, that what spots soever of
sin are contracted in my flesh, thy Divine power may blot out; thou who hast
been pleased in the beginning, to create the Heaven and Earth, of thy Mercy
restore the same, who art pleased to restore lost man to thy most Holy Kingdome
; Oh Lord of wisdome , restore Eloquence into all my senses , that I, though an
unworthy sinner, may be confirmed in thy knowledge, and in all thy works, by the
grace of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who livest and reignest three in one,
<I>Amen</I>.</P></FONT>
<H4>An Oration to recover lost wisdome.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Oh God of living , Lord of all Creatures visible and invisible, Administrator
and Dispenser of all things, enlighten my Heart this day by the grace of thy
Holy Spirit, strengthen my inward man, and pour into me the dew of thy grace,
whereby thou instructest the Angels; inform me with the plenty of thy knowledge,
wherewith from the beginning thou hast taught thy faithful; let thy grace work
in me, and the flouds of thy grace and Spirit, cleanse and correct the filth of
my Conscience. Thou who comest from Heaven upon the Waters of thy Majesty,
confirm this wonderful Sacrament in me. </P></FONT>
<H4>To obtain the grace of the Holy Spirit.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Oh Lord my God, Father of all things, who revealest thy celestial and
terrestrial secrets to thy Servants, I humbly beseech and implore thy Majesty,
as thou art the King and Prince of all knowledge, hear my Prayers; and direct my

unto thee, Oh God, hear my Clamor, I sigh to thee, hear the sighings of my
heart, and alwayes preserve my Spirit, Soul, and Body, under the Safeguard of
thy Holy Spirit; O God thou Holy Spirit, perpetual and Heavenly charity, whereof
the Heaven and Earth is full, breath upon my operation; and what I require to
thy honour and praise, grant unto me; let thy Holy Spirit come upon me, rule and
reign in me, <I>Amen</I>.</P></FONT>
<H4>To recover intellectual wisdome.</H4><FONT size=2>

according to thy unspeakeable Name, extend thy merciful Ears and Eyes to the

my self guilty: O <I>Theos hazamagiel:</I> Oh mercyful Lord God, raise up the
sences of my flesh: Oh God of all living, and of all Kingdomes, I confesse Oh
Lord this day, that I am thy servant. Rehearse these Orations also in the other
dayes four times, once in the morning, once in the evening, once about the third
hour, and once on the ninth; And thou shalt acquire Memory, Eloquence and
stability fully, <I>Amen.</P></I></FONT>
<H4>The Conclusion of the whole work, and Confirmation of the Science
obtained.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Oh God, Maker of all things; who hast created all things out of nothing; who
hast wonderfully created the Heaven and Earth, and all things by degrees in
order, in the beginning, with thy Son, by whom all things are made, and into
whom all things shall at last return: Who art Alpha and Omega: I beseech thee
though a sinner, &amp; unworthy, that I may attain to my desired end in this
Holy Art, speedily, and not lose the same by my sins; but do good unto me,
according to thy unspeakable mercy: who doth not to us after our sins, nor
rewardeth us after our iniquities, <I>Amen.</I> Say this in the end devoutly: Oh
wisdome of God the Father incomprehensible, Oh most mercyful Son , give unto me
of thy ineffable mercy, great knowledge and wisdome, as thou didst wonderfully
bestow all Science to King <I>Solomon</I>, not looking upon his sins or
wickedness, but thy own mercies: wherefore I implore thy mercy, although I am a
most vile and unworthy sinner, give such an end to my desires in this art,
whereby the hands of thy bounty may be enlarged towards me, and that I may the
more devoutly walk by thy light in thy wayes, and be a good example to others;
by which all that see mee, and hear me, may restrain themselves from their
vices, and praise thy holyness through all Worlds, <I>Amen</I>. Blessed be the
Name of the Lord, <I>&amp;c.</I> rehearse these two Orations alwayes in the end,
to confirm thy knowledge gained.</P></FONT>
<H4>The Benediction of the place.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Blesse Oh Lord this place, that there may be in it Holy Sanctity, chastity,
meekness, victory, holiness, humility, goodness, plenty, obedience of the Law,
to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; Hear Oh Lord, holy Father, Almighty eternal
God; and send thy Holy Angel <I>Michael</I>, who may protect, keep, preserve and
visit me, dwelling in this Tabernacle, by him who liveth, <I>&amp;c.</I> </P>
<P>When you would operate, have respect to the Lunations: they are to be chosen
in those moneths, when the <IMG alt=[Sun] src="">Rules in <IMG alt=[Gemini]
src="">and <IMG alt=[Virgo] src=""><IMG alt=[Aries] src=""><IMG alt=[Leo]
src=""><IMG alt=[Libra] src=""><IMG alt=[Taurus] src="">, in these moneths you
may begin. </P>
<P>In the Name of the Lord beginneth this most Holy Art, which the most high God
Administered to <I>Solomon</I> by his Angel upon the Altar, that thereby
suddenly in a short space of time, he was established in the knowledge of all
Sciences; and know, that in these Orations are contained all Sciences, Lawful
and unlawful; First, if you pronounce the Orations of Memory, Eloquence, and
understanding, and the stability thereof; they will be mightily increased,
insomuch that you will hardly keep silence; for by a word all things were
Created, and by the virtue of that word all created beings stand, and every
Sacrament, and that Word is God. Therefore let the Operator be constant in his
faith, and confidently believe, that he shall obtain such knowledge and wisdome,
in the pronouncing these Orations, for with God nothing is impossible: therefore
let the Operator proceed in his work, with faith, hope, and a constant desire:
firmly believing; because we can obtain nothing but by faith; Therfore have no
doubt in this Operation, whereof there are three species whereby the Art may be
obtained. </P>
<P>The first species is Oration, and reason of a Godly mind, not by attempting a
voyce of deprecation, but by reading and repeating the same in the inward parts.
The second species is fasting and praying, for the praying man God heareth. The
third species is chastity; he that would operate in this Art, let him be clean
and chast by the space of nine dayes at least; and before you begin, it is
necessary that you know the time of the <IMG alt=[Moon] src="">. for in the
prime of the <IMG alt=[Moon] src="">. it is proper to operate in this Art: and
when you begin so sacred an Art, have a care to abstain from all mortal sins, at
least while you are proceeding in this work until it be finished and compleated:
and when you begin to operate, say this verse kneeling: Lift up the light of thy
Countenance upon me, Oh Lord my God, and forsake not me thy servant N. that
trusts in thee: Then say three times <I>Pater Noster</I>, &amp;c. And assert
that thou wilt never commit wilfull perjury, but alwayes persevere in faith and
hope. This being done, with bended knees in the place wherein thou wilt operate,
say, Our help is in the Name of the Lord, who hath made Heaven and earth: And I
will enter into the Invocation of the most high, unto him who enlightneth and
purifieth my Soul and Conscience, which dwelleth under the help of the most
high, and continueth under the protection of the God of Heaven: O Lord open and
unfold the doubts of my Heart, and change me into a new man by thy love: be thou
Oh Lord unto me true faith, the hope of my life, and perfect charity, to declare
thy wonders. Let us pray: Then say the Oration following: </P>
<P>Oh God my God, who from the beginning hast Created all things out of nothing,
and reformest all things by thy Spirit; restore my Conscience, and heal my
understanding, that I may glorify thee in all my thoughts, words and deeds;
through him who liveth and reigneth with thee forever, <I>Amen.</I> </P>
<P>Now in the Name of <I>Christ</I>, on the first day of the Month, in which
thou wouldst acquire Memory, Eloquence and Understanding, and stability thereof,
with a perfect, good and contrite heart, and sorrow for thy sins committed; thou
maist begin to pronounce these Orations following, which appertain to the
obtaining of Memory and all Sciences, and which were composed and delivered by
the Angel to <I>Solomon</I>, from the hand of God. </P>
<P>The first and last Oration of this art, is Alpha and Omega: Oh God
omnipotent, <I>&amp;c.</I> </P>
<P>This following is an Oration of four Languages, which is this: <I>Hely,
Schemat, Azatan, honiel sichut, tam, imel, Iatatandema, Jetromiam, Theos:</I> Oh
Holy and strong God, <I>Hamacha, mal, Gottneman, Alazaman, Actuaar, Secheahal,
Salmazan, zay, zojeracim, Lam hay, Masaraman, grensi zamach, heliamat, seman,
selmar, yetrosaman muchaer, vesar, hasarian Azaniz, Azamet, Amathemach,
hersomini.</I> And thou most Holy and just God, incomprehensible in all thy
works, which are Holy just and good; <I>Magol, Achelmetor, samalsace, yana,
Eman,</I> and <I>cogige, maimegas, zemmail, Azanietan, illebatha sacraman,
reonas, grome, zebaman, zeyhoman, zeonoma, melas, heman, hathoterma, yatarmam,
semen, semetary,</I> Amen. This Oration ought to follow the first of the ten
above written. </P></FONT>
<H4>To perform any work.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>This is to follow the third Oration above: I confesse, <I>O Theos
hazamagielgezuzan, sazaman, Sathaman, getormantas, salathiel, nesomel, megal
vuieghama, yazamir, zeyhaman, hamamal amna, nisza, deleth, hazamaloth, moy
pamazathoran hanasuelnea, sacromomem, gegonoman, zaramacham Cades bachet
girtassoman, gyseton palaphatos halathel Osachynan machay,</I> Amen. </P>
<P>This is a true and approved experiment, to understand all Arts and secrets of
the World, to find out and dig up minerals and treasure; this was revealed by
the Heavenly Angel in this Notory Art. For this Art doth also declare things to
come, and rendereth the sense capable of all arts in a short time, by the Divine
use thereof. </P>
<P>We are to speak also of the time and place. First therefore, all these
precepts are to be observed and kept; and the Operator ought to be clean,
chaste, to repent of his sins, and earnestly desire to cease from sinning as
much as may be; and so let him proceed, and every work shall be investigated
into him, by the divine ministery. </P>
<P>When thou wilt operate in the new Moon, kneeling say this verse: Lift up the
light of thy Countenance upon us, Oh God, and forsake us not, Oh Lord our God.
Then say three times the <I>Pater Noster:</I> And afterwards let him vow unto
God, that he will never commit wilfull perjury, but alwayes persist in faith.
This being done, at night say with bended knees before thy bed, Our help is in
the Name of the Lord, <I>&amp;c.</I> and this Psalm; Whoso dwelleth under the
shadow of the wings of the most high, to the end; and the Lords Prayer, and the
Prayer following. </P><I>
<P>Theos Pater vehemens</I>; God of Angels, I Pray and invocate thee by thy most
Holy Angels <I>Eliphamasay, Gelomiros, Gedo bonay, Saranana, Elomnia,</I> and by
all thy Holy Names, by us not to be pronounced, which are these: <I>de. el. x p
n k h t li g y y.</I> not to be spoken, or comprehended by humane sense; I
beseech thee cleanse my Conscience with the Splendor of thy Name; illustrate and
confirm my understanding withthe sweet savour of thy Holy Spirit: O Lord Adorne
my Soul, that I may understand and perfectly remember what I hear; reform my
Heart, and restore my Heart, and restore my sense Oh Lord God, and heal my
bowels: open my mouth most merciful God, and frame and temper my Tongue to the
praise and glory of thy Name, by thy glorious and unspeakeable Name. O Lord, who
art the Fountain of all goodness, and original of all piety, have patience with
me, and give unto me a true understanding, to know whatsoever is fitting for me,
and retain the same in Memory: thou who dost not presently Judge a sinner, but
mercifully expectest repentance; I beseech thee, though unworthy, to wash away
the filth of my sins and wickedness, and grant me my petitions, to the praise
and glory of thy Holy Name; who livest and reignest one God in perfect Trinity,
World without end, <I>Amen</I>. </P></FONT>
<H4>Some other precepts to be observed in this work.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Fast the day following with bread and water, and give Almes; if it be the
Lord's day, then give double Almes; be clean in body and mind; both thy self ,
and put on clean Cloaths.</P></FONT>
<H4>The processe follows.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>When thou wilt operate concerning any difficult Probleme or Question, with
bended knees, before thy bed, make Confession unto God the Father; and having
made thy Confession, say this Oration. </P>
<P>Send Oh Lord thy wisdome to assist me, that it may be with me, and labour
with me, and that I may alwayes know what is acceptable before thee; and that
unto me <I>N.</I> may be manifested the truth of this question or Art. </P>
<P>This being done, Thrice in the day following, when thou risest, give thanks
to God Almighty, saying, Glory and honour, and benediction be unto him that
sitteth on the Trone, and that liveth for ever and ever, <I>Amen.</I> with
bended knees and stretched out hands. </P>
<P>But if thou desirest to understand any book, ask of some that hath knowledge
therein, what that book treateth of: This being done, open the book, and read in
it; and operate as at first three times, and alwayes when thou goest to sleep,
write Alpha and Omega, and afterwards sleep on thy right side, putting the palme
of thy hand under thy Ear, and thou shalt see in a dream all things thou
desirest; and thou shalt hear the voyce of one informing and instructing thee in
that book, or in any other faculty wherein thou wilt operate: And in the
morning, open the book, and read therein; and thou shalt presently understand
the same, as if thou hadst studyed in it a long time: And alwayes remember to
give thanks to God, as aforesaid. </P>
<P>Afterwards on the first day say this Oration: Oh Father, Maker of all
Creatures; by thy unspeakeable power wherewith thou hast made all things, stir
up the same power, and come and save me, and protect me from all adversity of
Soul and Body, <I>Amen</I>. Of the Son say, O Christ, Son of the living God, who
art the splendor and figure of light, with whom there is no alteration nor
shaddow of change; Thou Word of God most high, thou wisdome of the Father; open
unto me, thy unworthy servant <I>N.</I> the veins of thy saving Spirit, that I
may wisely understand, retain in Memory, and declare all thy wonders: Oh
wisdome, who proceedest out of the mouth of the most high, powerfully reaching
from end to end, sweetly disposing of all things in the World, come and teach me
the way of prudence and wisdome. Oh Lord which didst give thy Holy Spirit to thy
Disciples, to teach and illuminate their Hearts, grant unto me thy unworthy
servant <I>N.</I> the same Spirit, and that I may alwayes rejoyce in his
consolation.</P></FONT>
<H4>Other precepts.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Having finished these Orations, and given Almes, when thou entrest into thy
Chamber, devoutly kneel down before thy bed, saying this Psalm: Have mercy upon
me, O God, according to the multitude of thy great mercies, <I>&amp;c.</I> and,
In thee Oh Lord have I trusted, <I>&amp;c.</I> Then rise up, and go to the wall,
and stretch forth thy hands, having two nayles fixed, upon which thou maist stay
up thy hands, and say this Prayer following with great devotion: O God, who for
us miserable sinners didst undergo the painful death upon the Crosse; to whom
also <I>Abraham</I> offer'd up his son <I>Isaac</I>; I thy unworthy servant, a
sinner perplexed with many evils, do this day offer up and Sacrifice unto thee
my Soul and Body, that thou maist infuse into me thy Divine wisdome, and inspire
me with the Spirit of Prophesy , wherewith thou didst inspire the Holy Prophets.
</P>
<P>Afterwards say this Psalm; Oh Lord incline thine ears unto my words,
<I>&amp;c.</I><BR>and add,<BR>The Lord is my shepherd, and nothing shall I want:
he shall set me down in green pastures, his servant <I>N.</I> he shall lead me
upon the waters of refreshment, he converteth my Soul, and leadeth me <I>N.</I>
upon the paths of his righteousness for his Holy Name: Let my evening Prayer
ascend upunto thee Oh Lord, and let thy mercy descend upon me thy unworthy
servant <I>N.</I> protect, save, blesse, and sanctify me, that I may have a
shield against all the wicked darts of my enemies: defend me Oh Lord by the
price of the blood of the just One, wherewith thou hast redeemed me; who livest
and reignest God, whose wisdom hath laid the foundation of the Heaven, and
formed the Earth, and placed the Sea in her bounds: and by the going forth of
thy Word hast made all Creatures, and hath formed man out of the dust of the
Earth, according to his own image and likeness; who gave to <I>Solomon</I> the
son of King <I>David</I> inestimable wisdome: hath given to his Prophets the
Spirit of Prophesy, and infused into Philosophers wonderfull Philosophical
knowledge, confirmed the Apostles with fortitude, comforted and strengthened the
Martyrs, who exalteth his elect from eternity, and provideth for them; Multiply
Oh Lord God, thy mercy upon me thy unworthy servant <I>N.</I> by giving me a
teachable wit, and an understanding adorned with virture and knowledge, a firm
and sound Memory, that I may accomplish and retain whatsoever I endeavour,
through the greatness of thy wonderful Name; lift up, Oh Lord my God, the light
of thy countenance upon me, that hope in thee: Come and teach me, Oh Lord God of
virtues, and shew me thy face, and I shall be safe. Then add this Psalm: Unto
thee Oh Lord do I lift up my Soul: Oh my God in thee do I trust; excepting that
verse, <I>Confundantur,</I> &amp;c. </P>
<P>Having fulfilled these things upon the wall, descend unto thy Bed, writing in
thy right hand Alpha and Omega: then go to bed, and sleep on thy right side,
holding thy hand under thy right Ear, and thou shalt see the greatness of God as
thou hast desired. And in the morning, on thy knees, before thy bed, give thanks
unto God for those things he hath revealed to thee: I give thanks unto thee, Oh
great and wonderful God, who hast given Salvation and knowledge of Arts unto me
thy unworthy servant <I>N.</I> and confirm this Oh God, which thou hast wrought
in me, in preserving me. I give thanks unto thee, O powerful Lord God, who
createdst me miserable sinner out of nothing, when I was not, and when I was
utterly lost; not redeemed, but by the precious blood of thy Son our Lord
<I>Jesus Christ</I>; and when I was ignorant thou hast given unto me learning
and knowledge: grant unto me thy servant <I>N.</I> O Lord <I>Jesus Christ</I>,
that through this knowledge, I may be alwayes constant in thy Holy service,
<I>Amen.</I> </P>
<P>These operations being devoutly compleated, give thanks daily with these last
Orations. But when thou wouldst read, study, or dispute, say, Remember thy word
unto thy Servant, O Lord, in which thouhast given me hope; this is my comforter
in humility. Then add these Orations: Remember me O Lord of Lords, put good
words and speech into my mouth, that I may be heard efficaciously and and
powerfully, to the praise, glory, and honour of thy glorious Name, which is
Alpha and Omega, blessed for ever, World without end, <I>Amen.</P></I></FONT>
<H4>Then silently say these Orations.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>O Lord God, that daily workest new signs and unchangeable wonders, fill me
with the spirit of wisedome, understanding and Eloquence; make my mouth as a
sharp Sword, and my Tongue as an arrow elected, &amp; confirm the words of my
mouth to all wisdome: mollify the Hearts of the hearers to understand what they
desire, <I>Elysenach, Tzacham</I>, &amp;c.</P></FONT>
<H4>The manner of Consecrating the Figure of Memory.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>It ought to be consecrated with great faith, hope and charity; and being
consecrated, to be kept and used in operation as followeth. </P>
<P>On the first day of the new Moon, having beheld the new Moon, put the Figure
under your right Ear, and so consequently every other night, and seven times a
day; the first hour of the morning saying this Psalm, <I>Qui habitat</I>,
&amp;c. throughout; and the Lords Prayer once, and this Oration <I>Theos
Patyr</I> once in the first hour of the day: then say this Psalm, <I>Confitebor
tibi Domine,</I> &amp;c. and the Lords Prayer twice, and the Oration <I>Theos
Patyr</I> twice. </P>
<P>In the third hour of the day the Psalm <I>Benedicat anima mea Dominum,</I>
&amp;c. the Lords Prayer thrice, and the Oration <I>Theos Patyr</I>. </P>
<P>In the sixth hour say this Psalm: <I>Appropinquet deprecato mea in conspectu
tuo Domine, secundum eloquium tuum.</I> </P>
<P>Grant unto me Memory, and hear my voyce according to thy great mercy, and
according unto thy word grant Eloquence, and my lips shall shew forth thy
majesty, when thou shalt teach me thy Glory: <I>Gloria patria,</I> &amp;c, say
the Lords Prayer nine times, and <I>Theos Patyr.</I> </P>
<P>In the nineth hour, say the Psalm <I>Beati immaculati in via</I>; the Lords
Prayer 12 times, and <I>Theos Patyr.</I> </P>
<P>In the Evening say this Psalm, <I>Deus misereatur nostri</I>: the Lords
Prayer 15 times, and <I>Theos Patyr</I> as often. </P>
<P>The last hour say this Psalm, <I>Deus Deus meus respice in me</I>, &amp;c.
&amp; <I>Deus in adjutorium meum intende</I>, and <I>te Deum Laudamus</I>; the
Lords Prayer once, and <I>Theos Patyr:</I> then say the Oration following twice.
</P>
<P>O God, who hast divided all things in number, weight, and measure, in hours,
nights, and dayes; who countest the number of the Stars, give unto me constancy
and virtue, that in the true knowledge of this Art <I>N.</I> I may love thee,
who knows the gifts of thy goodness, who livest and reignest,
<I>&amp;c.</P></I></FONT>
<H4>Four dayes the Figure of Memory ought to be consecrated with these
Orations.</H4>
<H4>O Father of all Creatures, of the Sun and Moon.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>Then on the last day let him bath himself, and put on clean garments, and
clean <I>* Ornaments</I>, and in a clean place, suffumigate himself with
Frankincense, and come in a convenient hour in the night with a light Kindled,
but so that no man may see thee; and before the bed upon your knees say this
Oration with great devotion. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>* Lectisternium, a Robe in which the Priests used to sleep in the
  Temples, to receive the Divine Oracles. </BLOCKQUOTE><I>
<P>O most great and most Holy Father,</I> seven or nine times: then put the
Figure with great reverence about your Head; and sleep in the Bed with clean
linnen vestiments, and doubt not but you shall obtain whatsoever you desire for
this hath been proved by many, to whom such coelestial secrets of the Heavenly
Kingdome are granted, <I>Amen.</P></I>
<P><IMG alt=[En src=""></P></FONT>
<H4>The Oration following ought to be said as you stand up.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>O great God, Holy Father, most Holy Sanctifier of all Saints, three and one,
most high King of Kings, most powerful God Almighty, most glorious and most wise
Dispensor, Moderator, and Governour of all Creatures, visible and invisible: O
mighty God, whose terrible and most mighty Majesty is to be feared, whose
omnipotency the Heaven, the Earth, the Sea, Hell, and all things that are
therein, do admire, reverence, tremble at, and obey. </P>
<P>O most powerful , most mighty, and most invincible Lord God of Sabaoth: O God
incomprehensible; the wonderful Maker of all things, the Teacher of all
learning, Arts and Sciences; who mercifully Instructest the humble and meek: O

Sciences; who art able instantly to infuse Wisdome, Knowledg, and Learning into
any man; whose Eye beholdeth all things past, present, and to come; who art the
daily Searcher of all hearts; through whom we are, we live and dye; who sittest
upon the Cherubins; who alone seest and rulest the bottomeless pit: whose Word
gives Law throughtout the universal World: I confesse my self this day before
thy Holy and glorious Majesty, and before the company of all Heavenly virtues
and Potentates, praying thy glorious Majesty, invocating thy great Name, which
is a Name wonderful, and above every Name, blessing thee O Lord my God: I also
beseech thee, most high, most omnipotent Lord, who alone art to be adored; O
thou great and dreadful God Adonay, wonderful Dispensator of all beatitudes, of
all Dignities, and of all goodness; Giver of all things, to whomsoever thou
wilt, mercifully, aboundantly and permanently: send down upon me this day the

created <I>Adam</I> the first man, according to thy image and likeness; fortify
the Temple of my body, and let thy Holy Spirit descend and dwell in my Heart,
that I may shine forth the wonderful beams of thy Glory: as thou hast been
pleased wonderfully to operate in thy faithful Saints; So O God, most wonderful
King, and eternal glory, send forth from the seat of thy glorious Majesty, a
seven-fold blessing of thy grace, the Spirit of Wisedome and Understanding, the
Spirit of fortitude and Counsel , the Spirit of knowledge and Godliness, the
Spirit of fear and love of thee, to understand thy wonderful Holy and occult
mysteries, which thou art pleased to reveal, and which are fitting for thine to
know, that I may comprehend the depth, goodness, and inestimable sweetness of
thy most immense Mercy, Piety and Divinity. And now O most merciful Lord, who
didst breath into the first Man the breath of life, be pleased this day to
infuse into my Heart a true perfect perceiving, powerful and right understanding
in all things; a quick, lasting, and indeficient Memory, and efficacious
Eloquence; the sweet, quick and piercing Grace of thy Holy Spirit, and of the
multitude of thy blessings, which thou bountifully bestowest: grant that I may
despise all other things, and glorify, praise, adore, bless and magnify thee the
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and alwayes set forth thy praise, mercy, and
omnipotency: that thy praise may alwayes be in my mouth, and my Soul may be
inflamed with thy Glory for ever before thee. O thou who art God omnipotents,

<H4>The following Oration hath power to expell all lusts.</H4><FONT size=2>
<P>O Lord, Holy Father, omnipotent eternal God, of inestimable mercy and immense
goodness; O most merciful <I>Jesus Christ</I>, repairer and restorer of mankind;
O Holy Ghost, comforter and love of the faithful: who holdest all the Earth in

that the virtue of thy Holy Spirit may be increased in me, among the saving
gifts of thy faithful, to the comfort and salvation of my Heart, Soul, and Body.
O most great and most Holy God, Maker, Redeemer, and Restorer of mankind, I am

beseeching thee, with my whole Heart, to restore me a miserable sinner, and
receive me to thy great mercy; give me Eloquence, Learning, and Knowledge, that
those that shall hear my words, they may be mellifluous in their Hearts; that
seeing and hearing thy wisdome, the proud may be made humble, and hear and
understand my words with great humility, and consider the greatness and goodness
of thy blessings, who livest and reignest now and for ever, <I>Amen.</I> </P>
<P>Note, that if you desire to know any thing that you are ignorant of,
especially of any Science, read this Oration: <I>I confess my self to thee this
day, O God the Father of Heaven and Earth</I>, three times; and in the end
express for what you desire to be heard; afterwards, in the Evening when you go
to Bed, say the Oration <I>Theos</I> throughout, and the Psalm <I>Qui

second or third hour of the night, thou shalt see thy desires, and know without
doubt that which thou desirest to find out: and write in thy right hand Alpha
and Omega, with the sign of the Cross, and put that hand under thy right Ear,
and fast the day before; only once eating such meat as is used on fasting dayes.
