<H1 align=center>Arbatel of Magic</H1>
<H4 align=center>Translated into English by Robert turner,</H4><FONT size=2>

<H3>The PREFACE</H3><I><FONT size=2>
<P>To the unprejudiced Reader</P></I></FONT><FONT size=7>
<P>A</FONT><FONT size=2>s the fall of man made himself and all other creatures
subject to vanity; so, by reason thereof, the most noble arid excellent Arts
wherewith the Rational soul was indued, are by the rusty canker of Time brought
unto Corruption. For Magick itself, which the ancients did so divinely
contemplate, is scandalized with bearing the badge of all diabolical sorceries:
which Art (saith <I>Mirandula) Pauci intelligunt, multi reprehendunt, &amp;
sicut canes ignotos semper allatrant: </I>Few understood, many reprehend, and as
dogges barke at those they know not: so doe many condemn and hate the things
they understand not. Many men there are, that abhor the very name and word
<I>Magus, </I>because of <I>Simon Magus,</I> who being not <I>Magus,</I> but
<I>Goes, </I>that is, familiar with evil Spirits, usurped that Title. But
Magicke and Witchcraft are far differing Sciences; whereof <I>Pliny*</I> being
ignorant, scoffeth thereat: for <I>Nero</I> (saith <I>Pliny)</I> who had the
most excellent Magicians of the East sent to him by <I>Tyridates </I>king of
<I>Armenia,</I> who held that kingdom by him, found the Art after long study and
labour altogether ridiculous. Now Witchcraft and Sorcery, are works done merely
by the devil, which with respect unto some covenant made with man, he acteth by
men his instruments, to accomplish his evil ends: of these, the histories of all
ages, people and countries, as also the holy Scriptures, afford us sundry
examples. </P></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[* Plin. lib. 30. Nat. Hist.] </BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P>But <I>Magus</I> is a Persian word primitively, whereby is expressed such a
one as is altogether conversant in things divine; as <I>Plato</I> affirmeth, the
Art of Magick is the art of worshipping God: and the Persians call their gods
<IMG alt=[Magos] src="">hence <I>Apollonius</I> saith, that <I>Magus</I> is
either <IMG src="">, or <IMG src="">, that is, that Magus is a name sometime of
him that is a god by nature, &amp; sometimes of him that is in the service of
God: in which latter sense it is taken in Matt., 2.1,2. when the wise men came
to worship Jesus, and this is the first and highest kind, which is called divine
Magick; and these the Latins did entitle <I>sapientes,</I> or wise men: for the
feare and worship of God, is the beginning of knowledge. These wise men the
Greeks call <I>Philosophers;</I> and amongst the Egyptians they were termed
<I>Priests;</I> the Hebrews termed them <I>Cabalistos,</I> Prophets, Scribes and
Pharisees; and amongst the Babylonians they were differenced by the name of
<I>Caldeans; </I>&amp; by the Persians they were called <I>Magicians:</I> and
one speaking of <I>Sosthenes,</I> one of the ancient Magicians, useth these
words: <I>Et verum Deum merita majestate prosequitur, &amp; angelos ministros
Dei, sed veri ejus venerationi novit assistere; idem dæmonas prodit terrenos,
Vagos, humanitatis inimicos; Sosthenes</I> ascribeth the due Majesty to the true
God, &amp; acknowledgeth that his Angels are ministers and messengers which
attend the worship of the true God; he also hath delivered, that there are
devils earthly and wandering, and enemies to mankind. </P>
<P>So that the word <I>Magus</I> of itself imports a Contemplator of divine
&amp; heavenly Sciences; but under the name <I>Magick,</I> are all unlawful Arts
comprehended; as Necromancy and Witchcraft, and such Arts which are effected by
combination with the devil, and whereof he is a party.</P>
<P>These Witches and Necromancers are also called <I>Malefici </I>or
<I>venefici;</I> sorcerers or poisoners; of which names witches are rightly
called, who without the Art of Magick do indeed use the help of the devil
himself to do mischief; practising to mix the powder of dead bodies with other
things by the help of the devil prepared; and at other times to make pictures of
wax, clay, or otherwise (as it were <I>Sacramentaliter)</I> to effect those
things which the devil by other means bringeth to pass. Such were, and to this
day partly, if not altogether, are the corruptions which have made odious the
very name of Magick, having chiefly sought, as the manner of all impostures is,
to counterfeit the highest and most noble part of it. </P>
<P>A second kind of Magick is Astrologie, which judgeth of the events of things
to come, natural and humane, by the motions and influences of the stars upon the
lower elements, by them observed and understood. </P><I>
<P>Philo Judaeus</I> affirmeth, that by this part of Magick or Astrologie,
together with the motions of the Stars and other heavenly bodies, <I>Abraham</I>
found out the knowledge of the true God while he lived in <I>Caldea, Qui
Contemplatione Creaturarum, cognovit Creatorem</I> (saith <I>Damascen)</I> who
knew the Creator by the contemplation of the creature. <I>Josephus</I> reporteth
of <I>Abraham,</I> that he instructed the Egyptians in Arithmetic and Astronomy;
who before <I>Abraham's</I> coming unto them, knew none of these Sciences.
</P><I>
<P>Abraham sanctitate &amp; sapientia omnium præstantissimus, primum Caldæos,
deinde Phoenices, demum Egyptios Sacerdotes, Astrologia &amp; Divina docuerit.
Abraham</I> the holiest and wisest of men, did first teach the Caldeans, then
the Phoenicians, lastly the Egyptian Priests, Astrologie and Divine knowledge.
</P>
<P>Without doubt, <I>Hermes Trismegistus,</I> that divine Magician and
Philosopher, who (as some say) lived long before <I>Noah,</I> attained to much
Divine knowledge of the Creator through the study of Magick and Astrologie; as
his writings testifie. </P>
<P>The third kind of Magick containeth the whole Philosophy of Nature; which
bringeth to light the innermost virtues, and extracteth them out of Nature's
hidden bosome to humane use: <I>Virtutes in centro centri latentes;</I> Virtues
hidden in the centre of the Centre, according to the Chymists: of this sort were
<I>Albertus, Arnoldus de villa nova, Raymond. Bacon</I> and others,
<I>&amp;c.</I> </P>
<P>The Magick these men profess'd, is thus defined. <I>Magia est connexio a viro
sapiente agentium per naturam cum patientibus, sibi, congruenter respondentibus,
ut inde opera prodeant, non sine corum admiratione qui causam ignorant.</I>
Magick is the connexion of natural agents and patients, answerable each to
other, wrought by a wise man, to the bringing forth of such effects as are
wonderful to those that know not their causes. </P>
<P>In all these, <I>Zoroaster</I> was well learned, especially in the first and
highest: for in his Oracles he confesseth God to be the first and the highest;
he believeth of the Trinity, which he would not investigate by any natural
knowledge: he speaketh of Angels, and of Paradise; approveth the immortality of
the soul; teacheth Truth, Faith, Hope, and Love, discoursing of the abstinence
and charity of the <I>Magi.</I> </P>
<P>Of this <I>Zoroaster, Eusebius</I> in the Theology of the Phoenicians, using
<I>Zoroaster's</I> own words: <I>Hæc ad verbum scribit</I> (saith <I>Eusebius)
Deus primus, incorruptibilium, sempiternus, ingenitus, expers partium sibi ipsi
simillimus, bonorum omnium auriga, munera non expectans, optimus,
prudentissimus, pater juris, sine doctrina justitiam per doctus, natur
perfectus, sapiens, sacræ naturæ unicus inventor,</I> &amp;c. Thus saith
<I>Zoroaster, </I>word for word: God the first, incorruptable, everlasting,
unbegotten, without parts, most like himself, the guide of all good, expecting
no reward, the best, the wisest, the father of right, having learned justice
without teaching, perfect, wise by nature, the onely inventor thereof. </P>
<P>So that a Magician is no other but <I>divinorum cultor &amp; interpres,</I> a
studious observer and expounder of divine things; and the Art itself is none
other <I>quam Naturalis Philosophiæ absoluta consummatio,</I> then the absolute
perfection of Natural Philosophy. Nevertheless there is a mixture in all things,
good with evil, of falsehood with truth, of corruption with purity. The good,
the truth, the purity, in every kinde, may well be embraced: As in the ancient
worshipping of God by Sacrifice, there was no man knowing God among the Elders,
that did not forbear to worship the God of all power, or condemn that kinde of
Worship, because the devil was so adored in the image of <I>Baal, Dagon,
Astaroth, Chemosh, Jupiter, Apollo,</I> and the like. </P>
<P>Neither did the abuse of Astrology terrify <I>Abraham,</I> (if we believe the
most ancient and religious writers) from observing the motions and natures of
the heavenly bodies. Neither can it dehort wise and learned men in these days
from attributing those vertues, influences, and inclinations, to the Stars and
other Lights of heaven, which God hath given to those his glorious creatures.
</P>
<P>I must expect some calumnies and obtrectations against this, from the
malicious prejudiced men, and the lazie affecters of Ignorance, of whom this age
swarms: but the voice and sound of the Snake and Goose is all one. But our
stomacks are not now so queazie and tender, after so long time feeding upon
solid Divinity, nor we so umbragious and startling, having been so long
enlightened in God's path, that we should relapse into that childish Age, in
which <I>Aristotle's</I> Metaphysicks, in a Council in <I>France, </I>was forbid
to be read. </P>
<P>But I incite the Reader to a charitable opinion hereof, with a Christian
Protestation of an innocent purpose therein; and intreat the Reader to the
Reader to follow this advice of <I>Tabæus, Qui litigant, sint ambo in conspectis
tuo mali &amp; rei. </I>And if there be any scandal in this enterprise of mine,
it is taken, not given. And this comfort I have in that Axiome of
<I>Trismegistus, Qui pius est, summe philosopatur</I>. And therefore I present
it without disguise, and object it to all of candor and indifferencie: and of
Readers, of whom there be four sorts, as one observes: Spunges, which attract
all without distinguishing; Hour-glasses, which receive, and pour out as fast;
Bags, which retain onely the dregs of Spices, and let the Wine escape; and
Sieves, which retain the best onely. Some there are of the last sort, and to
them I present this <I>Occult Philosophy,</I> knowing that they may reap good
thereby. And they who are severe against it, they all pardon this my opinion,
that such their severity proceeds from Self-guiltiness; and give me leave to
apply that of <I>Ennodius</I> that it is the nature of Self-wickedness, to think
that of others, which themselves deserve. And it is all the comfort which guilty
have, not to find any innocent. But that amongst others this may find some
acceptance, is the desire of </P><I>

<H2 align=center>ARBATEL OF MAGICK</H2><I><FONT size=2>
<P align=center>Containing nine Tomes, and seven Septenaries of</P>
<P align=center>APHORISMS.</P></I>
<P>The first is called <I>Isagoge,</I> or, A Book of the Institutions of Magick:
or <IMG src="">which in fourty and nine Aphorisms comprehendeth, the most
general Precepts of the whole Art. The second is Microcosmical Magick, what
<I>Microcosmus</I> hath effected Magically, by his Spirit and Genius addicted to
him from his Nativity, that is, spiritual wisdom: and how the same is effected.
</P>
<P>The third is Olympick Magick, in what maner a man may do and suffer by the
spirits of <I>Olympus.</I> </P>
<P>The fourth is Hesiodiacal, and Homerical Magick, which teacheth the
operations by the Spirits called <I>Cacodæmones, </I>as it were not adversaries
to mankinde. </P>
<P>The fifth is Romane or Sibylline Magick, which acteth and operates with
Tutelar Spirits and Lords, to whom the whole Orb of the earth is distributed.
This is <I>valde insignis Magia</I>. To this also is the doctrine of the
<I>Druids</I> referred. </P>
<P>The sixth is Pythagorical Magick, which onely acteth with Spirits to whom is
given the doctrine of Arts, as Physick, Medicine, Mathematics, Alchymie, and
such kinde of Arts. </P>
<P>The seventh is the Magick of <I>Apollonius</I>, and the like, and agreeth
with the Romane and Microcosmical Magick: onely it hath this peculiar, that it
hath power over the hostile spirits of mankinde. </P>
<P>The eighth is Hermetical, that is, Ægyptiacal Magick; and differeth not much
from Divine Magick. </P>
<P>The ninth is that wisdom which dependeth solely upon the Word of God; and
this is called Prophetical Magick.<BR><BR><BR></P>

<H1 align=center>Arbatel of Magick</H1><FONT size=2>
<P align=center>CALLED</P></FONT><I>
<H3 align=center>ISAGOGE</H3></I><FONT size=2>
<P>In the Name of the Creator of all things both visible and invisible, who
revealeth his Mysteries out of his Treasures to them that call upon him; and
fatherly and mercifully bestoweth those his Secrets upon us without measure. May
he grant unto us, through his onely-begotten Son Jesus Christ our Lord, his
ministring spirits, the revealers of his secrets, that we may write this Book of
Arbatel, concerning the greatest Secrets which are lawful for man to know, and
to use them without offence unto God. <I>Amen</I>.<BR></P></FONT>
<H3 align=center>The first Septenary of Aphorisms.</H3><I><FONT size=2>
<P align=center>The first Aphorism.</P></I>
<P>Whosoever would know Secrets, let him know how to keep secret things
secretly; and to reveal those things that are to be revealed, and to seal those
things which are to be sealed: and <I>not to give holy things to dogs, nor cast
pearls before swine. </I>Observe this Law, and the eyes of thy understanding
shall be opened, to understand secret things; and thou shalt have whatsoever thy
minde desireth to be divinely revealed unto thee. Thou shalt have also the
Angels and Spirits of God prompt and ready in their nature to minister unto
thee, as much as any humane minde can desire. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 2.</P></I>
<P>In all things call upon the Name of the Lord: and without prayer unto God
through his onely-begotten son, do not thou undertake to do or think any thing.
And use the Spirits given and attributed unto thee, as Ministers, without
rashness and presumption, as the messengers of God; having a due reverence
towards the Lord of Spirits. And the remainder of thy life do thou accomplish,
demeaning thy self peaceably, to the honour of God, and the profit of thy self
and thy neighbour.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 3.</P></I>
<P>Live to thy self, and the Muses: avoid the friendship of the Multitude: be
thou covetous of time, beneficial to all men. Use thy Gifts, be vigilant in thy
Calling; and let the Word of God never depart from thy mouth.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 4.</P></I>
<P>Be obedient to good Admonitions: avoid all procrastination: accustom thy self
to Contancie and Gravity, both in thy words and deeds. Resist temptations of the
Tempter, by the Word of God. Flee from earthly things; seek after heavenly
things. Put no confidence in thy own wisdom; but look unto God in all things,
according to that sentence of the Scripture: <I>When we know not what we shall
do, unto thee, O God, do we lift up our eyes, and from thee we expect our
help</I>. For where all humane refuges do forsake us, there will the help of God
shine forth, according to the saying of <I>Philo.</I> </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 5.</P>
<P>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
strength, and thy neighbour as thy self:</I> And the Lord will keep thee as the
apple of his eye, and will deliver thee from all evil, and will replenish thee
with all good; and nothing shall thy soul desire, but thou shalt be fully endued
therewith, so that it be contingent to the salvation of thy soul and body.
</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 6.</P></I>
<P>Whatsoever thou hast learned, frequently repeat, and fix the same in thy
minde: and learn much, but not many things, because a humane understanding
cannot be alike capable in all things, unless it be such a one that is divinely
regenerated; unto him nothing is so difficult or manifold, which he may not be
able equally to attain to. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 7.</P>
<P>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will hear thee, and thou shalt
glorifie me,</I> saith the Lord. For all Ignorance is tribulation of the minde;
therefore call upon the Lord in thy ignorance, and he will hear thee. And
remember that thou give honour unto God, and say with the Psalmist, <I>Not unto
us, Lord, but unto thy Name give the glory.<BR></P></I></FONT>
<H3 align=center>The second Septenary.</H3><I><FONT size=2>
<P align=center>Aphor. 8.</P></I>
<P>Even as the Scripture testifies, that God appointeth names to things or
persons, and also with them hath distributed certain powers and offices out of
his treasures: so the Characters and Names of Stars have not any power by reason
of their figure or pronunciation, but by reason of the vertue or office which
God hath ordained by nature either to such a Name or Character. For there is no
power either in heaven or in earth, or hell, which doth not descend from God;
and without his permission, they can neither give or draw forth into any action,
any thing they have. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 9.</P></I>
<P>That is the chiefest wisdom, which is from God; and next, that which is in
spiritual creatures; afterwards. in corporal creatures; fourthly, in Nature, and
natural things. The Spirits that are apostate, and reserved to the last
judgement, do follow these, after a long interval. Sixthly, the ministers of
punishments in hell, and the obedient unto God. Seventhly, the Pigmies do not
possess the lowest place, and they w ho inhibit in elements, and elementary
things. It is convenient therefore to know and discern all differences of the
wisdom of the Creator and the Creatures, that it may be certainly manifest unto
us, what we ought to assume to our use of every thing, and that we may know in
truth how and in what maner that may be done. For truely every creature is
ordained for some profitable end to humane nature, and for the service thereof;
as the holy Scriptures, Reason, and Experience, do testifie. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 10.</P></I>
<P>God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things
visible and invisible, in the holy Scriptures proposeth himself to have an eye
over us; and as a tender father which loveth his children, he teacheth us what
is profitable, and what not; what we are to avoid, and what we are to embrace:
then he allureth us to obedience with great promises of corporal and eternal
benefits, and deterreth us (with threatning of punishments) from those things
which are not profitable for us. Turn over therefore with thy hand, both night
and day, those holy Writings, that thou mayest be happie in things present, and
blessed in all eternity. Do this, and thou shalt live, which the holy Books have
taught thee. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 11.</P>
<P>A number of Four is <I>Pythagorical, </I>and the first Quadrate; therefore
here let us place the foundation of all wisdom, after the wisdom of God revealed
in the holy Scriptures, and to the considerations proposed in Nature. </P>
<P>Appoint therefore to him who solely dependeth upon God, the wisdom of every
creature to serve and obey him, <I>nolens volens</I>, willing or unwilling. And
in this, the omnipotency of God shineth forth. It consisteth therefore in this,
that we will discern the creatures which serve us, from those that are
unwilling; and that we may learn how to accommodate the wisdom and offices of
every creature unto our selves. This Art is not delivered, but divinely. Unto
whom God will, he revealeth his secrets; but to whom he will not bestow any
thing out of his treasuries, that person shall attain to nothing without the
will of God. </P>
<P>Therefore we ought to desire <IMG src="">from God alone, which will
mercifully impart these things unto us. For he who bath given us his Son, and
commanded us to pray for his holy Spirit, How much more will he subject unto us
the whole creature, and things visible and invisible? <I>Whatsoever ye ask, ye
shall receive.</I> Beware that ye do not abuse the gifts of God, and all things
shall work together unto you for your salvation. And before all things, be
watchful in this, That your names be written in heaven: this is more light, That
the spirits be obedient unto you, as Christ admonisheth. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 12.</P><I>
<P>In the Acts of the Apostles,</I> the Spirit saith unto <I>Peter</I> after the
Vision, <I>Go down, and doubt not but I have sent them</I>, when <I>he</I> was
sent for from <I>Cornelius</I> the Centurion. After this maner, in vocal words,
are all disciplines delivered, by the holy Angels of God, as it appeareth out of
the Monuments of the Ægyptians. And these things afterwards were vitiated and
corrupted with humane opinions; and by the instigation of evil spirits, who sow
tares amongst the children of disobedience, as it is manifest out of <I>St.
Paul</I>, and <I>Hermes Trismegistus.</I> There is no other maner of restoring
these Arts. then by the doctrine of the holy Spirits of God; because true
<I>faith cometh by hearing.</I> But because thou mayst be certain of the truth.
arid mayst not doubt whether the spirits that speak with thee, do declare things
true or false, let it onely depend upon thy faith in God; that thou mayst say
with <I>Paul, I know on whom I trust.</I> If no sparrow can fall to the ground
without the will of the Father which is in heaven, How much more will not God
suffer thee to be deceived, O thou of little faith, if thou dependest wholly
upon God, and adherest onely to him?</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 13.</P></I>
<P>The Lord liveth; and all things which live, do live in him. And he is truely
<IMG alt=[Ã¤Ã¥Ã¤Ã©] src=""></FONT><FONT face="Web Hebrew AD" size=5>,
</FONT><FONT size=2>who hath given unto all things, that they be that which they
are: and by his word alone, through his Son, hath produced all things out of
nothing, which are in being. He calleth all the stars. and all the host of
heaven by their names. He therefore knoweth the true strength and nature of
things, the order and policie of every creature visible and invisible. to whom
God hath revealed the names of his creatures. It remaineth also, that he receive
power from God, to extract the vertues in nature, and hidden secrets of the
creature; and to produce their power into action, out of darkness into light.
Thy scope therefore ought to be, that thou have the names of the Spirits, that
is, their powers and offices, and how they are subjected and appointed by God to
minister unto thee; even as <I>Raphael</I> was sent to <I>Tobias,</I> that he
should heal his father, and deliver his son from dangers, and bring him to a
wife. So <I>Michael,</I> the fortitude of God governeth the people of God:
<I>Gabriel, </I>the messenger of God, was sent to <I>Daniel, Mary,</I> and
<I>Zachary </I>the father of <I>John Baptist.</I> And he shall be given to thee
that desirest him, who will teach thee whatsoever thy soul shall desire, in the
nature of things. His ministery thou shalt use with trembling and fear of thy
Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, that is to say, the Father, Son, and holy
Ghost: and do not thou let slip any occasion of learning and be vigilant in thy
calling, and thou shalt want nothing that is necessary for thee.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 14.</P></I>
<P>Thy soul liveth for ever, through him that hath created thee: call therefore
upon the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serve. This thou shalt do, if
thou wilt perform that end for which thou art ordained of God, and what thou
owest to God and to thy neighbour. God requireth of thee a minde, that thou
shouldest honour his Son, and keep the words of his Son in thy heart: if thou
honour him, thou hast done the will of thy Father which is in heaven. To thy
neighbour thou owest offices of humanity, and that thou draw all men that come
to thee, to honour the Son. This is the Law and the Prophets. In temporal
things, thou oughtest to call upon God as a father, that he would give unto thee
all necessaries of this life: and thou oughtest to help thy neighbour with the
gifts which God bestoweth upon thee, whether they be spiritual or corporal.</P>
<P>Therefore thou shalt pray thus:</P></FONT><I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>O Lord of heaven and earth, Creator and Maker of all things
  visible and invisible; I, though unworthy, by thy assistance call upon thee,
  through thy onely begotten Son Jesus Christ our Lord, that thou wilt give unto
  me thy holy Spirit, to direct me in thy truth unto all good</I>. Amen.
</BLOCKQUOTE><I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because I earnestly desire perfectly to know the Arts of this life
  and such things as are necessary for us, which are so overwhelmed in darkness,
  and polluted with infinite humane opinions, that I of my own power can attain
  to no knowledge in them, unless thou teach it me: Grant me therefore one of
  thy spirits, who may teach me those things which thou wouldest have me to know
  and learn, to thy praise and glory, and the profit of our neighbour. Give me
  a/so an apt and teachable heart, that I may easily understand those things
  which thou shalt teach me, and may hide them in my understanding, that I may
  bring them forth as out of thy inexhaustible treasures, to all necessary uses.
  And give me grace, that I may use such thy gifts humbly, with fear and
  trembling, through our Lord Jesus Christ, with thy holy Spirit</I>.

<P>They are called Olympick spirits, which do inhabit in the firmament, and in
the stars of the firmament: and the office of these spirits is to declare
Destinies, and to administer fatal Charms, so far forth as God pleaseth to
permit them: for nothing, neither evil spirit nor evil Destiny, shall be able to
hurt him who hath the most High for his refuge. If therefore any of the
<I>Olympick</I> spirits shall teach or declare that which his star to which he
is appointed portendeth, nevertheless he can bring forth nothing into action,
unless he be permitted by the Divine power. It is God alone who giveth them
power to effect it. Unto God the maker of all things, are obedient all things
celestial, sublunary, and infernal. Therefore rest in this: Let God be thy guide
in all things which thou undertakest, and all things shall attain to a happie
and desired end; even as the history of the whole world testifieth and daily
experience sheweth. There is peace to the godly: <I>there is no peace to the
wicked, saith the Lord</I>. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 16.</P></I>
<P>There are seven different governments of the Spirits of <I>Olympus</I>, by
whom God hath appointed the whole frame and universe of this world to be
governed: and their visible stars are ARATRON, BETHOR, PHALEG, OCH, HAGITH,
OPHIEL, PHUL, after the <I>Olympick</I> speech. Every one of these hath under
him a mighty <I>Militia</I> in the firmament. </P>
<UL>
  <LI>ARATHON ruleth visible Provinces XLIX.
  <LI>BETHOR, XLII.
  <LI>PHALEG, XXXV.
  <LI>OCH, XXVIII.
  <LI>HAGITH, XXI.
  <LI>OPHIEL, XIIII.
  <LI>PHUL, VII.</LI></UL>
<P>So that there are 186 <I>Olympick</I> Provinces in the whole Universe.
wherein the seven Governours do exercise their power: all which are elegantly
set forth in Astronomy. But in this place it is to be explained, in what maner
these Princes and Powers may he drawn into communication. <I>Aratron</I>
appeareth in the first hour of <I>Saturday</I>, and very truely giveth answers
concerning his Provinces and Provincials. So likewise do the rest appear in
order in their days and hours. Also every one of them ruleth 490 yeers. The
beginning of their simple <I>Anomaly</I>, in the 60 yeer before the Nativity of
Christ, was the beginning of the administration of <I>Bethor</I>, and it lasted
until the yeer of our Lord Christ 430. To whom succeeded <I>Phaleg</I>, until
the 920 yeer. Then began <I>Och</I>, and continued until the year 1410, and
thenceforth <I>Hagith</I> ruleth untill the year 1900. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. 17.</P></I>
<P>Magically the Princes of the seven Governments are called simply, in that
time, day and hour wherein they rule visibly or invisibly, by their Names and
Offices which God hath given unto them; and by proposing their Character which
they have given or confirmed. </P>
<P>The governor <STRONG>Aratron</STRONG> hath in his power those things which he
doth naturally, that is, after the same manner and subject as those things which
in Astronomy are ascribed to the power of <I>Saturn</I>. </P><I>
<P>Those things which he doth of his own free will, are,</I> </P>
<P>1. That he can convert any thing into a stone in a moment, either animal or
plant, retaining the same object to the sight. </P>
<P>2. He converteth treasures into coles, and coles into treasure. </P>
<P>3. He giveth familiars with a definite power. </P>
<P>4. He teacheth <I>Alchymy</I>, Magick, and Physick. </P>
<P>5. He reconcileth the subterranean spirits to men; maketh hairy men. </P>
<P>6. He causeth one to bee invisible. </P>
<P>7. The barren he maketh fruitful, and giveth long life. </P><I>
<P align=center>His character.</I><BR><BR><IMG src=""></P>
<P>He hath under him 49 Kings, 42 Princes, 35 Presidents, 28 Dukes, 21

36000 legions of spirits; the number of a legion is 490.</P><STRONG>
<P>Bether</STRONG> [sic] governeth those things which are ascribed to
<I>Jupiter</I>: he soon cometh being called. He that is dignified with his
character, he raiseth to very great dignities, to cast open treasures: he
reconcileth the spirits of the aire, that they give true answers: they transport
precious stones from place to place, and they make medicines to work
miraculously in their effects: he giveth also familiars of the firmament, and
prolongeth life to 700 yeares if God will. </P><I>

<P align=center>His character.</I> <BR><BR><IMG src=""></P><STRONG>

stones: he giveth gold, and a purse springing with gold. He that is dignified
with his Character, he maketh him to be worshipped as a Deity, by the Kings of
the whole world. </P><I>
<P align=center>The Character.</I> <BR><BR><IMG src=""></P>

things; healeth the dropsie: he giveth spirits of the water, who do serve men in
a corporeal and visible form; and maketh men to live 300 yeers.</P><I>
<P align=center>The most general Precepts of this Secret.</P></I>
<P>1. Every Governour acteth with all his Spirits, either naturally, to wit,
always after the same maner; or otherwise of their own free-will, if God hinder
them not. </P>
<P>2. Every Governour is able to do all things which are done naturally in a
long time, out of matter before prepared; and also to do them suddenly, out of
matter not before prepared. As <I>Och</I>, the Prince of Solar things, prepareth
gold in the mountains in a long time; in a less time, by the Chymical Art; and
Magically, in a moment. </P>
<P>3. The true and divine Magician may use all the creatures of God, and offices
of the Governours of the world, at his own will, for that the Governours of the
world are obedient unto them, and come when they are called, and do execute
their commands: but God is the Author thereof: as <I>Joshua</I> caused the Sun
to stand still in heaven. </P>
<P>They send some of their Spirits to the Mean Magicians, which do obey them
onely in some determinate business: but they hear not the false Magicians, but
expose them to the deceits of the devils, and cast them into divers dangers, by
the Command of God; as the Prophet <I>Jeremiah</I> testifieth, in his eighth
Chapter, concerning the Jews. </P>
<P>4. In all the elements there are the seven Governours with their hosts, who
do move with the equal motion of the firmament; and the inferiours do always
depend upon the superiours, as it is taught in Philosophy. </P>
<P>5. A man that is a true Magician, is brought forth a Magician from his
mothers womb: others, who do give themselves to this office, are unhappie. This
is that which <I>John </I>the Baptist speaketh of: <I>No man can do any thing of
himself, except it be given him from above</I>. </P>
<P>Every Character given from a Spirit, for what cause soever, hath his
efficacie in this business, for which it is given, in the time prefixed: But it
is to be used the same day and Planetary hour wherein it is given. </P>
<P>7. God liveth, and thy soul liveth: keep thy Covenant, and thou hast
whatsoever the spirit shall reveal unto thee in God, because all things shall be
done which the Spirit promiseth unto thee. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. </I>18.</P>
<P>There are other names of the<I> Olymick </I>spirits delivered by others; but
they onely are effectual, which are delivered to any one, by the Spirit the
revealer, visible or invisible: and they are delivered to every one as they are
predestinated: therefore they are called Constellations; and they seldome have
any efficacie above 40 yeers. Therefore it is most safe for the young practisers
of Art, that they work by the offices of the Spirits alone, without their names;
and if they are pre-ordained to attain the Art of Magick, the other parts of the
Art will offer themselves unto them of their own accord. Pray therefore for a
constant faith, and God will bring to pass all things in due season.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 19.</P><I>
<P>Olympus</I> and the inhabitants thereof, do of their own accord offer
themselves to men in the forms of Spirits, and are ready to perform their
Offices for them, whether they will or not: by how much the rather will they
attend you, if they are desired? But there do appear also evil Spirits, and
destroyers, which is caused by the envy and malice of the devil; and because men
do allure and draw them unto themselves with their sin, as a punishment due to
sinners. Whosoever therefore desireth familiarly to have a conversation with
Spirits, let him keep himself from enormious [sic] sins, and diligently pray to
the most High to be his keeper; and he shall break through all the snares and
impediments of the devil: and let him apply himself to the service of God, and
he will give him an increase in wisdom.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor </I>20.</P>
<P>All things are possible to them that believe them, and are willing to receive
them; but to the incredulous and unwilling, all things are unpossible [sic]:
there is no greater hinderance then a wavering minde, levity, unconstancy,
foolish babbling, drunkenness, lusts, and disobedience to the word of God. A
Magician therefore ought to be a man that is godly, honest, constant in his
words and deeds, having a firm faith toward God, prudent, and covetous of
nothing but of wisdom about divine things.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. </I>21.</P>
<P>When you would call any of the <I>Olympick </I>Spirits, observe the rising of
the Sun that day, and of what nature the Spirit is which you desire; and saying
the prayer following, your desires shall he perfected. </P></FONT><I>

<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 22.</P>
<P>We call that a secret, which no man can attain unto by humane industry
without revelation; which Science lieth obscured, hidden by God in the creature;
which nevertheless he doth permit to be revealed by Spirits, to a due use of the
thing it self. And these secrets are either concerning things divine, natural or
humane. But thou mayst examine a few, and the most select, which thou wilt
commend with many more.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 23.</P>
<P>Make a beginning of the nature of the secret, either by a Spirit in the form
of a person, or by vertues separate, either in humane Organs, or by what manner
soever the same may be effected; and this being known, require of a Spirit which
knoweth that art, that he would briefly declare unto thee whatsoever that secret
is: and pray unto God, that he would inspire thee with his grace, whereby thou
maist bring the secret to the end thou desireth, for the praise and glory of
God, and the profit of thy neighbour. </P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 24.</P><I>
<P align=center>The greatest secrets are number seven.</P></I>
<P>1. The first is the curing of all diseases in the space of seven dayes,
either by character, or by natural things, or by the superior Spirits with the
divine assistance. </P>
<P>2. The second is, to be able to prolong life to whatsoever age we please: I
say, a corporal and natural life. </P>
<P>3. The third is, to have the obedience of the creatures in the elements which
are in the forms of personal Spirits; also of Pigmies,* Sagani, Nymphes,
Dryades, and Spirits of the woods. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[* <I>Spirits of the four elements</I>. Paracels.]</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P>4. The fourth is, to be able to discourse with knowledge and understanding of
all things visible and invisible, and to understand the power of every thing,
and to what it belongeth. </P>
<P>5. The fifth is, that a man be able to govern himself according to that end
for which God hath appointed him. </P>
<P>6. The sixth is, to know God, and Christ, and his holy Spirit: this is the
perfection of the <I>Microcosmus</I>. </P>
<P>7 The seventh, to be regenerate, as <I>Henochius</I> the King of the
inferiour world. </P>
<P>These seven secrets a man of an honest and constant minde may learn of the
Spirits, without any offence unto God.</P><I>
<P align=center>The mean Secrets are likewise seven in number.</P></I>
<P>1. The first is, the transmutation of Metals, which is vulgarly called
<I>Alchymy</I>; which certainly is given to very few, and not but of special
grace. </P>
<P>2. The second is, the curing of diseases with Metals, either by the magnetick
vertues of precious stones, or by the use of the Philosophers stone, and the
like. </P>
<P>3 The third is, to be able to perform Astronomical and Mathematical miracles,
such as are <I>Hydraulick</I>-engines, to administer business by the influence
of Heaven, and things which are of the like sort. </P>
<P>4. The fourth is, to perform the works of natural Magick, of what sort soever
they be. </P>
<P>5. The fifth is, to know all Physical secrets. </P>
<P>6. The sixth is, to know the foundation of all Arts which are exercised with
the hands and offices of the body. </P>
<P>7. The seventh is, to know the foundation of all Arts which are exercised by
the angelical nature of man.</P><I>
<P align=center>The lesser secrets are seven.</P></I>
<P>1. The first is, to do a thing diligently, and to gather together much money.
</P>
<P>2. The second is, to ascend from a mean state to dignities and honours, and
to establish a newer family, which may be illustrious and do great things. </P>
<P>3. The third is, to excel in military affairs, and happily to achieve to
great things, and to be an head of the head of Kings and Princes. </P>
<P>4. To be a good house-keeper both in the Country and City. </P>
<P>5. The fifth is, to be an industrious and fortunate Merchant. </P>
<P>6. To be a Philosopher, Mathematician, and Physician, according to
<I>Aristotle, Plato, Ptolomy, Euclides, Hippocrates</I>, and <I>Galen</I>. </P>
<P>7. To be a Divine according to the Bible and Schooles, which all writers of
divinity both old and new have taught.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 25.</P>
<P>We have already declared what a secret is, the kindes and species thereof: it
remaineth now to shew how we may attain to know those things which we desire.
</P>
<P>The true and onely way to all secrets, is to have recourse unto God the
Author of all good; and as Christ teacheth, <I>In the first place seek ye the
kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto
you.</I> </P>
<P>2. <I>Also see that your hearts be not burthened with surfeting, and
drunkenness, and the cares of this life</I>. </P>
<P>3. <I>Also commit your cares unto the Lord, and he will do it</I>. </P>
<P>4. <I>Also I the Lord thy God do teach thee, what things are profitable for
thee, and do guide thee in the way wherein thou walkest.</I> </P>
<P>5. <I>And I will give thee understanding, and will teach thee in the way
wherein thou shalt go, and I will guide thee with my eye.</I> </P>
<P>6 <I>Also if you which are evil, know how to give good things to your
children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give his holy
Spirit to them that ask him?</I> </P>
<P>7. <I>If you will do the will of my Father which is in heaven, ye are truly
my disciples, and we will come unto you, and make our abode with you.</I> </P>
<P>If you draw these seven places of Scripture from the letter unto the Spirit,
or into action, thou canst out erre, but shalt attain to the desired bound; thou
shalt not erre from the mark, and God himself by his holy Spirit will teach thee
true and profitable things: he will give also his ministring Angels unto thee,
to be thy companions, helpers, and teachers of all the secrets of the world, and
he will command every creature to be obedient unto thee, so that cheerfully
rejoycing thou maist say with the Apostles, That the Spirits are obedient unto
thee; so that at length thou shalt be certain of the greatest thing of all, That
thy name is written in Heaven.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 26.</P>
<P>There is another way which is more common, that secrets may be revealed unto
thee also, when thou art unwitting thereof, either by God, or by Spirits which
have secrets in their power; or by dreams, or by strong imaginations and
impressions, or by the constellation of a nativity by celestial knowledge. After
this manner are made heroick men, such as there are very many, and all learned
men in the world, <I>Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, Euclides, Archimedes,
Hermes Trismegistus</I> the father secrets, with <I>Theophrastus,
Paracelsus</I>; all which men had in themselves all the vertues of secrets.
Hitherto also are referred, <I>Homer, Hesiod, Orpheus, Pytagoras</I>; but these
had not such gifts of secrets as the former. To this are referred, the Nymphes,
and sons of <I>Melusina</I>, and Gods of the Gentiles, <I>Achilles, Æneas,
Hercules</I>: also, <I>Cyrus, Alexander</I> the great, <I>Julius Cæsar,
Lucullus, Sylla. Marius</I>. </P>
<P>It is a canon, That every one know his own Angel. and that he obey him
according to the word of God; and let him beware of the snares of the evil
Angel, lest he be involved in the calamities of <I>Brute</I> and <I>Marcus
Antonius</I>. To this refer the book of <I>Jovianus Pontanus</I> of Fortune, and
his <I>Eutichus</I>. </P>
<P>The third way is, diligent and hard labor, without which no great thing can
be obtained from the divine Deity worthy admiration, as it is
said,</P></FONT><I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Tu nihil invita dices facie sue Minerva</I>.<BR>Nothing canst thou
  do or say against <I>Minerva</I>'s will.</BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P>We do detest all evil Magicians, who make themselves associates with the
devils with their unlawful superstitions, and do obtain and effect some things
which God permitteth to be done, instead of the punishment of the devils. So
also they do other evil acts, the devil being the author, as the Scripture
testifie of <I>Judas</I>. To these are referred all idolaters of old, and of our
age, and abusers of Fortune, such as the heathens are full of. And to these do
appertain all Charontick evocation of Spirits the works of <I>Saul</I> with the
woman, and <I>Lucanus</I> prophesie of the deceased souldier, concerning the
event of the Pharsalian war, and the like.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 27.</P>
<P>Make a Circle with a center A, which is B. C. D. E. At the East let there be
B.C. a square. At the North, C.D. At the West, D.E. And at the South, E.D.
Divide the Several quadrants into seven parts, that there may be in the whole 28
parts: and let them be again divided into four parts, that there may be 112
parts of the Circle: and so many are the true secrets to revealed. And this
Circle in this manner divided, is the seal of the secrets of the world, which
they draw from the onely center A, that is, from the invisible God, unto the
whole creature. The Prince of the Oriental secrets is resident in the middle,
and hath three Nobles on either side, every one whereof hath four under him, and
the Prince himself hath four appertaining unto him. And in this manner the other
Princes and Nobles have their quadrants of secrets, with their four secrets. But
the Oriental secret is the study of all wisdom; The West, of strength; The
South, of tillage; The North, of more rigid life. So that the Eastern secrets
are commended to be the best; the Meridian to be mean; and the East and North to
be lesser. The use of this seal of secrets is, that thereby thou maist know
whence the Spirits or Angels are produced, which may teach the secrets delivered
unto them from God. But they have names taken from their offices and powers,
according to the gift which God hath severally distributed to every one of them.
One hath the power of the sword; another, of the pestilence; and another, of
inflicting famine upon the people, as it is ordained by God. Some are destroyers
of Cities, as those two were, who were sent to overthrow <I>Sodom</I> and
<I>Gomorrha</I>, and the places adjacent, examples whereof the holy Scripture
witnesseth. Some are the watch-men over Kingdoms; others the keepers of private
persons; and from thence, anyone may easily form their names in his own
language: so that he which will, may ask a physical Angel, mathematical, or
philosophical, or an Angel of civil wisdom, or of supernatural or natural
wisdom, or for any thing whatsoever; and let him ask seriously, with a great
desire of his minde, and with faith and constancy and without doubt, that which
he asketh he shall receive from the Father and God of all Spirits. This faith
surmounteth all seals, and bringeth them into subjection to the will of man. The
Characteristical maner of calling Angels succeedeth this faith, which dependeth
onely on divine revelation; But without the said faith preceding it, it lieth in
obscurity. Nevertheless, if any one will use them for a memorial, and not
otherwise, and as a thing simply created by God to his purpose, to which such a
spiritual power or essence is bound; he may use them without any offence unto
God. But let him beware, lest that he fall into idolatry, and the snares of the
devil, who with his cunning sorceries, easily deceiveth the unwary. And he is
not taken but onely by the finger of God, and is appointed to the service of
man; so that they unwillingly serve the godly; but not without temptations and
tribulations, because the commandment hath it, That he shall bruise the heel of
Christ, the seed of the woman. We are therefore to exercise our selves about
spiritual things, with fear and trembling, and with great reverence towards God,
and to be conversant in spiritual essences with gravity and justice. And he
which medleth with such things, let him beware of all levity, pride,
covetousness, vanity, envy and ungodliness, unless he wil miserably
perish.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. </I>28.</P>
<P>Because all good is from God, who is onely good, those things which we would
obtain of him, we ought to seek them by prayer in Spirit and Truth, and a simple
heart. The conclusion of the secret of secrets is, That every one exercise
himself in prayer, for those things which he desires, and he shall not suffer a
repulse. Let not any one despise prayer; for by whom God is prayed unto, to him
he both can and will give. Now let us acknowledge him the Author, from whom let
us humbly seek for our desires. A merciful &amp; good Father, loveth the sons of
desires, as <I>Daniel</I>; and sooner heareth us, then we are able to overcome
the hardness of our hearts to pray. But he will not that we give holy things to
dogs, nor despise and condemn the gifts of his treasury. Therefore diligently
and often read over and over the first Septenary of secrets, and guide and
direct thy life and all thy thoughts according to those precepts; and all things
shall yield to the desires of thy minde in the Lord, to whom thou
trustest.</P></FONT>
<H3 align=center>The Fifth Septenary</H3><I><FONT size=2>
<P align=center>Aphor. </I>29.</P>
<P>As our study of Magick proceedeth in order from general Rules premised, let
us now come to a particular explication thereof. Spirits either are divine
ministers of the word, and of the Church, and the members thereof ; or else they
are servient to the Creatures in corporal things, partly for the salvation of
the soul and body, and partly for its destruction. And there is nothing done,
whether good or evil, without a certain and determinate order and government. He
that seeketh after a good end, let him follow it; and he that desires an evil
end, pursueth that also, and that earnestly, from divine punishment, and turning
away from the divine will. Therefore let every one compare his ends with the
word of God, and as a touchstone that will judge between good and evil; and let
him propose unto himself what is to be avoided, and what is to be sought after;
and that which he constituteth and determineth unto himself, let him diligently,
not procrastinating or delaying, until he attain to his appointed bound.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 30.</P>
<P>They which desire riches, glory of this world, Magistracy, honours,
dignities, tyrannies, (and that magically) if they endeavour diligently after
them, they shall obtain them, every one according to his destiny, industry, and
magical Sciences, as the History of <I>Melesina</I> witnesseth, and the
Magicians thereof, who ordained, That none of the Italian nation should for ever
obtain the Rule or Kingdom of Naples; and brought it to pass, that he who
reigned in his age, to be thrown down from his seat: so great is the power of
the guardian or tutelar Angels of Kingdoms of the world.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 31.</P>
<P>Call the Prince of the Kingdom, and lay a command upon him, and command what
thou wilt, and it shall be done, if that Prince be not again absolved from his
obedience by a succeeding Magician. Therefore the Kingdom of <I>Naples</I> may
be again restored to the Italians, if any Magician shall call him who instituted
this order, and compel him to recal his deed; he may be compelled also, to
restore the secret powers taken from the treasury of Magick; A Book, a Gemme,
and magical Horn, which being had, any one may easily, if he will, make himself
the Monarch of the world. But <I>Judæus </I>chused rather to live among Gods,
until the judgement, before the transitory good of this world; and his heart is
so blinde, that he understandeth nothing of the God of heaven and earth, or
thinketh more, but enjoyeth the delights of things immortal, to his own eternal
destruction. And he may be easier called up, then the Angel of <I>Plotinus</I>
in the Temple of <I>Isis</I>.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 32.</P>
<P>In like manner also, the Romans were taught by the Sibyls books; and by that
means made themselves the Lords of the world, as Histories witness. But the
Lords of the Prince of a Kingdom do bestow the lesser Magistracies. He therefore
that desireth to have a lesser office, or dignity, let him magically call a
Noble of the Prince, and his desire shall be fulfilled.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 33.</P>
<P>But he who coveteth contemptible dignities, as riches alone, let him call the
Prince of riches, or one of his Lords, and he shall obtain his desire in that
kinde, whereby he would grow rich, either in earthly goods, or merchandize, or
with the gifts of Princes, or by the study of Metals, or Chymistry: as he
produceth any president of growing rich by these means, he shall obtain his
desire therein.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 34.</P>
<P>All manner of evocation is of the same kinde and form, and this way was
familiar of old time to the Sibyls and chief Priests. This in our time, through
ignorance and impiety, is totally lost; and that which remaineth, is depraved
with infinite lyes and superstitions.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 35.</P>
<P>The humane understanding is the onely effecter of all wonderful works, so
that it be joyned to any Spirit; and being joyned, she produceth what she will.
Therefore we are carefully to proceed in Magick, lest that Syrens and other
monsters deceive us, which likewise do desire the society of the humane soul.
Let the Magician carefully hide himself alwaies under the wings of the most
High, lest he offer himself to be devoured of the roaring Lion; for they who
desire earthly things, do very hardly escape the snares of the devil.</P></FONT>
<H3 align=center>The sixth Septenary.</H3><I><FONT size=2>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 36.</P>
<P>Care is to be taken, that experiments be not mixed with experiments; but that
every one be onely simple and several: for God and Nature have ordained all
things to a certain and appointed end: so that for examples sake, they who
perform cures with the most simple herbs and roots, do cure the most happily of
all. And in this manner, in Constellations, Words and Characters, Stones, and
such like, do lie hid the greatest influences or vertues in deed, which are in
stead of a miracle. </P>
<P>So also are words, which being pronounced, do forthwith cause creatures both
visible and invisible to yield obedience, aswel creatures of this our world, as
of the watry, aëry, subterranean, and Olympick supercelestial and infernal, and
also the divine. </P>
<P>Therefore simplicity is chiefly to be studied, and the knowledge of such
simples is to be sought for from God; otherwise by no other means or experience
they can be found out.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 37.</P>
<P>And let all lots have their place decently: Order, Reason and Means, are the
three things which do easily render all learning aswell of the visible as
invisible creatures. This is the course of Order, That some creatures are
creatures of the light; others, of darkness: these are subject to vanity,
because they run headlong into darkness, and inthral themselves in eternal
punishments for their rebellion. Their Kingdom is partly very beautiful in
transitory and corruptible things on the one part, because it cannot consist
without some vertue and great gifts of God; and partly most filthy and horrid to
be spoken of, because it aboundeth with all wickedness and sin, idolatry,
contempt of God, blasphemies against the true God and his works, worshippers of
devils, disobedience towards Magistrates, seditions, homicides, robberies,
tyranny, adulteries, wicked lusts, rapes, thefts, lyes, perjuries, pride, and a
covetous desire of rule; in this mixture consisteth the kingdom of darkness: but
the creatures of the light are filled with eternal truth, and with the grace of
God, and are Lords of the whole world, and do reign over the Lords of darkness,
as the members of Christ. Between these and the other, there is a continual war,
until God shall put an end to their strife, by his last judgement.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 38.</P>
<P>Therefore Magick is twofold in its first division; the one is of God, which
he bestoweth on the creatures of light; the other also is of God, but as it is
the gift which he giveth unto the creatures of darkness: and this is also
two-fold: the one is to a good end, as when the Princes of darkness are
compelled to do good unto the creatures, God enforcing them; the other is for an
evil end, when God permitteth such to punish evil persons, that magically they
are deceived to destruction; or, also he commandeth such to be cast out into
destruction. </P>
<P>The second division of Magick is, that it bringeth to pass some works with
visible instruments, through visible things; and it effecteth other works with
invisible instruments by invisible things; and it acteth other things, aswel
with mixed means, as instruments and effects. </P>
<P>The third division is, There are some things which are brought to pass by
invocation of God alone: this is partly Prophetical, and Philosophical; and
partly, as it were Theophrastical. </P>
<P>Other things there are, which by reason of the ignorance of the true God, are
done with the Princes of Spirits, that his desires may be fulfilled; such is the
work of the Mercurialists. </P>
<P>The fourth division is, That some exercise their Magick with the good Angels
in stead of God, as it were descending down from the most high God: such was the
Magick of <I>Baalim.</I> </P>
<P>Another Magick is, that which exerciseth their actions with the chief of the
evil Spirits; such were they who wrought by the minor Gods of the heathens. </P>
<P>The fifth division is, That some do act with Spirits openly, and face to
face; which is given to few: others do work by dreams and other signs; which the
ancients took from their auguries and sacrifices. </P>
<P>The sixth division is, That some work by immortal creatures, others by mortal
Creatures, as Nymphs, Satyrs, and such-like inhabitants of other elements,
Pigmies, &amp;c. </P>
<P>The seventh division is, That the Spirits do serve some of their own accord,
without art; others they will scarce attend, being called by art. </P>
<P>Among these species of Magick, that is the most excellent of all, which
dependeth upon God alone. The second, Them whom the Spirits do serve faithfully
of their own accord. The third is, that which is the property of Christians,
which dependeth on the power of Christ which he hath in heaven and earth.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 39.</P><I>
<P align=center>There is a seven-fold preparation to learn the Magick
Art.</P></I>
<P>The first is, to meditate day and night how to attain to the true knowledge
of God, both by his word revealed from the foundation of the world; as also by
the seal of the creation, and of the creatures; and by the wonderful effects
which the visible and invisible creatures of God do shew forth. </P>
<P>Secondly it is requisite, that a man descend down into himself, and chiefly
study to know himself; what mortal part he hath in him, and what immortal; and
what part is proper to himself, and what diverse. </P>
<P>Thirdly, That he learn by the immortal part of himself, to worship, love and
fear the eternal God, and to adore him in Spirit and Truth; and with his mortal
part, to do those things which he knoweth to be acceptable to God, and
profitable to his neighhours. </P>
<P>These are the three first and chiefest precepts of Magick, wherewith let
every one prepare himself that covets to obtain true Magick or divine wisdom,
that he may be accounted worthy thereof, and one to whom the Angelical creatures
willingly do service, not occultly onely, but also manifestly, and as it were
face to face. </P>
<P>Fourthly, Whereas every man is to be vigilant to see to what kinde life he
shall be called from his mothers wombe, that every one may know whether he be
born to Magick, and to what species thereof, which every one may perceive easily
that readeth these things, and by experience may have success therein; for such
things and such gifts are not given but onely to the low and humble. </P>
<P>In the fifth place we are to take care, that we understand when the Spirits
are assisting us, in undertaking the greatest business; and he that understands
this, it is manifest, that he shall be made a Magician of the ordination of God;
that is, such a person who useth the ministery of the Spirits to bring excellent
things to pass. Here, as for the most part, they sin, either through negligence,
ignorance, or contempt, or by too much superstition; they offend also by
ingratitude towards God, whereby many famous men have afterwards drawn upon
themselves destruction: they sin also by rashness and obstinacy; and also when
they do not use their gifts for that honor of God which is required, and do
prefer <IMG src="">. </P>
<P>Sixthly, The Magitian [sic] hath need of faith and taciturnity, especially,
that he disclose no secret which the Spirit hath forbid him, as he commanded
<I>Daniel</I> to seal some things, that is, not to declare them in publick; so
as it was not lawful for <I>Paul</I> to speak openly of all things which he saw
in a vision. No man will believe how much is contained in this one precept. </P>
<P>Seventhly, In him that would be a Magician, there is required the greatest
justice, that he undertake nothing that is ungodly, wicked or unjust, nor to let
it once come in his minde; and so he shall be divinely defended from all evil.
</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. </I>40.</P>
<P>When the Magician determineth with himself to do any incorporeal thing either
with any exteriour or interiour sense, then let him govern himself according to
these seven subsequent laws, to accomplish his Magical end. </P>
<P>The first Law is this, That he know that such a Spirit is ordained unto him
from God; and let him meditate that God is the beholder of all his thoughts and
actions; therefore let him direct all the course of his life according to the
rule prescribed in the word of God. </P>
<P>Secondly, Alwaies pray with <I>David, Take not thy holy Spirit from me; and
strengthen me with thy free Spirit; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil: I beseech thee, O heavenly Father, do not give power to any lying
Spirit, as thou didst over </I>Ahab <I>that he perished; but keep me in thy
truth.</I> Amen. </P>
<P>Thirdly, Let him accustome himself to try the Spirits, as the Scripture
admonisheth; for grapes cannot be gathered of thorns: let us try all things, and
hold fast that which is good and laudable, that we may avoid every thing that is
repugnant to the divine power. </P>
<P>The fourth is, To be remote and cleer from all manner of superstition; for
this is superstition, to attribute divinity in this place to things, wherein
there is nothing at all divine; or to chuse or frame to our selves, to worship
God with some kinde of worship which he hath not commanded: such are the Magical
ceremonies of Satan, whereby he impudently offereth himself to be worshipped as
God. </P>
<P>The fifth thing to be eschewed, is all worship of Idols, which bindeth any
divine power to idols or other things of their own proper motion, where they are
not placed by the Creator, or by the order of Nature: which things many false
and wicked Magitians faign. </P>
<P>Sixthly, All the deceitful imitations and affections of the devil are also to
be avoided, whereby he imitateth the power of the creation, and of the Creator,
that he may so produce things with a word, that they may not be what they are.
Which belongeth onely to the Omnipotency of God, and is not communicable to the
creature. </P>
<P>Seventhly, Let us cleave fast to the gifts of God, and of his holy Spirit,
that we may know them, and diligently embrace them with our whole heart, and all
our strength.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. </I>41.</P>
<P>We come now to the nine last Aphorismes of this whole Tome; wherewith we
will, the divine mercy assisting us, conclude this whole Magical <I>Isagoge.</I>
</P>
<P>Therefore in the first place it is to be observed, what we understand by
Magitian in this work. </P>
<P>Him then we count to be a Magitian, to whom by the grace of God. the
spiritual essences do serve to manifest the knowledge of the whole universe,
&amp; of the secrets of Nature contained therein, whether they are visible or
invisible. This description of a Magitian plainly appeareth, and is universal.
</P>
<P>An evil Magician is he, whom by the divine permission the evil Spirits do
serve, to his temporal and eternal destruction and perdition to deceive men, and
draw them away from God; such was <I>Simon Magus,</I> of whom mention is made in
the <I>Acts of the Apostles,</I> and in <I>Clemens; </I>whom Saint <I>Peter</I>
commanded to be thrown down upon the earth, when as he had commanded himself, as
it were a God, to be raised up into the air by the unclean Spirits. </P>
<P>Unto this order are also to be referred all those who are noted in the two
Tables of the Law; and are set forth with their evil deeds. </P>
<P>The subdivisions and species of both kindes of Magick, we will note in the
Tomes following. In this place it shall suffice, that we distinguish the
Sciences, which is good, and which is evil: Whereas man sought to obtain them
both at first, to his own ruine and destruction, as <I>Moses</I> and
<I>Hermes</I> do demonstrate.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor</I>. 42.</P>
<P>Secondly, we are to know, That a Magitian is a person predestinated to this
work from his mothers wombe; neither let him assume any such great things to
himself, unless he be called divinely by grace hereunto, for some good end; to a
bad end is, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <I>It must be that offences
will come; but wo be to that man through whom they come.</I> Therefore, as we
have before oftentimes admonished, With fear and trembling we must live in this
world. </P>
<P>Notwithstanding I will not deny, but that some men may with study and
diligence obtain some species of both kindes of Magick if it may be admitted.
But he shall never aspire to the highest kindes thereof; yet if he covet to
assail them, he shall doubtless offend both in soul and body. Such are they, who
by the operations of false Magicians, are sometimes carried to Mount
<I>Horch,</I> or in some wilderness, or desarts [deserts]; or they are maimed in
some member, or are simply torn in pieces, or are deprived of their
understanding; even as many such things happen by the use thereof, where men are
forsaken by God, and delivered to the power of Satan.<BR></P></FONT>
<H3 align=center>The Seventh Septenary.</H3><I><FONT size=2>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 43.</P>
<P>The Lord liveth, and the works of God do live in him by his appointment
whereby he willeth them to be; for he will have them to use their liberty in
obedience to his commands, or disobedience thereof. To the obedient, he hath
proposed their rewards; to the disobedient he hath propounded their deserved
punishment. Therefore these Spirits of their freewil, through their pride and
contempt of the Son of God, have revolted from God their Creator, and are
reserved unto the day of wrath; and there is left in them a very great power in
the creation; but notwithstanding it is limited, and they are confined to their
bounds with the bridle of God. Therefore the Magitian of God, which signifies a
wise man of God, or one informed of God, is led forth by the hand of God unto
all everlasting good, both mean things, and also the chiefest corporal things.
</P>
<P>Great is the power of Satan, by reason of the great sins of men. Therefore
also the Magitians of Satan do perform great things, and greater then any man
would believe: although they do subsist in their own limits, nevertheless they
are above all humane apprehension, as to the corporal and transitory things of
this life; which many ancient Histories, and daily Examples do testitie. Both
kindes of Magick are different one from the other in their ends: the one leadeth
to eternal good, and useth temporal things with thanksgiving; the other is a
little sollicitous about eternal things; but wholly exerciseth himself about
corporal things, that he may freely enjoy all his lusts and delights in contempt
of God and his anger.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 44.</P>
<P>The passage from the common life of man unto a Magical life, is no other but
a sleep, from that life; and an awaking to this life; for those things which
happen to ignorant and unwise men in their common life, the same things happen
to the willing and knowing Magitian. </P>
<P>The Magitian understandeth when the minde doth meditate of himself; he
deliberateth, reasoneth, constituteth and determineth what is to be done; he
observeth when his cogititions do proceed from a divine separate essence, and he
proveth of what order that divine separate essence is. </P>
<P>But the man that is ignorant of Magick, is carried to and fro, as it were in
war with his affections; he knoweth not when they issue out of his own minde, or
are impressed by the assisting essence; and he knoweth not how to overthrow the
counsels of his enemies by the word of God, or to keep himself from the snares
and deceits of the tempter.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor. </I>45.</P>
<P>The greatest precept of Magic is, to know what every man ought to receive for
his use from the assisting Spirit, and what to refuse: which he may learn of the
Psalmist, saying, <I>Wherewith shall a yong man cleanse his way? in keeping thy
word, Oh Lord.</I> To keep the word of God, so that the evil one snatch it not
out of the heart, is the chiefest precept of wisdom. It is lawful to admit of,
and exercise other suggestions which are not contrary to the glory of God, and
charity towards our neighbours, not inquiring from what Spirit such suggestions
proceed: But we ought to take heed, that we are not too much busied with
unnecessary things according to the admonition of Christ; <I>Martha, Martha,
thou art troubled about many things; but Mary hath chosen the better part, which
shall not be taken from her.</I> Therefore let us alwaies have regard unto the
saying of Christ, <I>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and
all these things shall be added unto you.</I> All other things, that is, all
things which are due to the mortal Microcosme, as food, raiment, and the
necessary arts of this life.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 46.</P>
<P>There is nothing so much becometh a man, as constancy in his words and deeds,
and when the like rejoyceth in his like; there are none more happy then such,
because the holy Angels are conversant about such, and possess the custody of
them: on the contrary, men that are unconstant are lighter then nothing, and
rotten leaves. We chuse the 46 Aphorisme from these. Even as every one governeth
himself, so he allureth unto himself Spirits of his nature and condition; but
one very truely adviseth, that no man should carry himself beyond his own
calling, lest that he draw unto himself some malignant Spirit from the uttermost
parts of the earth, by whom either he shall be infatuated and deceived, or
brought to final destruction. This precept appeareth most plainly: for
<I>Midas</I>, when he would convert all things into gold, drew up such a Spirit
unto himself, which was able to perform this; and being deceived by him, he had
been brought to death by famine, if his foolishness had not been corrected by
the mercy of God. The same thing happened to a certain woman about
<I>Franckford</I> at <I>Odera,</I> in our times, who would scrape together &amp;
devour mony of any thing. Would that men would diligently weigh this precept,
and not account the Histories of <I>Midas,</I> and the like, for fables; they
would be much more diligent in moderating their thoughts and affections, neither
would they be so perpetually vexed with the Spirits of the golden mountains of
<I>Utopia.</I> Therefore we ought most diligently to observe, that such
presumptions should be cast out of the minde, by the word, while they are new;
neither let them have any habit in the idle minde, that is empty of the divine
word.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 47.</P>
<P>He that is faithfully conversant in his vocation, shall have also the Spirits
constant companions of his desires, who will successively supply him in all
things. But if he have any knowledge in Magick, they will not be unwilling to
shew him, and familiarly to converse with him, and to serve him in those several
ministeries, unto which they are addicted; the good Spirits in good things, unto
salvation; the evil Spirits in every evil thing, to destruction. Examples are
not wanting in the Histories of the whole World; and do daily happen in the
world. <I>Theodosius</I> before the victory of <I>Arbogastus</I>, is an example
of the good; <I>Brute</I> before he was slain, was an example of the evil
Spirits, when he was persecuted of the Spirit of <I>Cæsar</I>, and exposed to
punishment, that he slew himself, who had slain his own Father, and the Father
of his Country.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 48.</P>
<P>All Magick is a revelation of Spirits of that kinde, of which sort the Magick
is; so that the nine Muses are called, in <I>Hesiod</I>, the ninth Magick, as he
manifestly testifies of himself in <I>Theogony. </I>In <I>Homer,</I> the genius
of <I>Ulysses</I> in <I>Psigiogagia. Hermes,</I> the Spirits of the more sublime
parts of the minde. God revealed himself to <I>Moses</I> in the bush. The three
wise men who came to seek Christ at <I>Jerusalem,</I> the Angel of the Lord was
their leader. The Angels of the Lord directed <I>Daniel</I>. Therefore there is
nothing whereof any one may glory; <I>For it is not unto him that willeth, nor
unto him that runneth; but to whom God will have mercy, </I>or of some other
spiritual fate. From hence springeth all Magick, and thither again it will
revolve, whether it be good or evil. In this manner <I>Tages </I>the first
teacher of the Magick of the Romanes, gushed out of the earth. <I>Diana</I> of
the Ephesians shewed her worship, as if it had been sent from heaven. So also
<I>Apollo</I>. And all the Religion of the Heathens is taken from the same
Spirits; neither are the opinions of the Sadduces, humane inventions.</P><I>
<P align=center>Aphor.</I> 49.</P>
<P>The conclusion therefore of this <I>Isagoge</I> is the same which we have
above already spoken of, That even as there is one God, from whence is all good;
and one sin, to wit, disobedience, against the will of the commanding God, from
whence comes all evil; so that <I>the fear of God is the beginning of all
wisdom,</I> and the profit of all Magick; for obedience to the will of God,
followeth the fear of God; and after this, do follow the presence of God and of
the holy Spirit, and the ministery of the holy Angels, and all good things out
of the inexhaustible treasures of God. </P>
<P>But unprofitable and damnable Magick ariseth from this; where we lose the
fear of God out of our hearts, and suffer sin to reign in us, there the Prince
of this world, the God of this world beginneth, and setteth up his kingdom in
stead of holy things, in such as he findeth profitable for his kingdom; there,
even as the spider taketh the flye which falleth into his web, so Satan
spreadeth abroad his nets, and taketh men with the snares of covetousness, until
he sucketh him, and draweth him to eternal fire: these he cherisheth and
advanceth on high, that their fall may be the greater. </P>
<P>Courteous Reader, apply thy eyes and minde to the sacred and profane
Histories, &amp; to those things which thou seest daily to be done in the world,
and thou shalt finde all things full of Magick, according to a two-fold Science,
good and evil, which that they may be the better discerned, we will put here
their division and subdivision, for the conclusion of these <I>Isagoges</I>;
wherein every one may contemplate, what is to be followed, and which to be
avoided, and how far it is to be labored for by every one, to a competent end of
life and living.<BR><BR></P></FONT>
