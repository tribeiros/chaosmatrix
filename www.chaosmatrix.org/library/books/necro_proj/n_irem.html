      Imad, Irem of the Pillars, the great city. I have spent ten years in the
      heart of the "Roba al Khaliyeh," the empty space, the great southern
      desert colored "Dahma," crimson. And I have seen the fabulous many pillars
      of Irem and I have been called "majnun," mad and possessed of the Jinn.
      Many are the strange and unbelievable marvels that may be seen there. Alas
      for the earth has swallowed up the City of Pillars, no more do the
      caravans of frankincense pass by. Many have called it a town of great
      wickedness, but do they dare comprehend the fabulous?
      <P>Irem was an earthly paradise to the initiated. Towers rising high, the
      great octagonal fort, alas no more! And there were places here of hidden
      knowledge and of power.
      <P>Some say it was built by giants, some by the tribe of Ad, but Irem was
      here before men and though swallowed she will protect her secrets from the
      profane, releasing them to the knowing
      <P>For there are many levels of existence for Irem, many levels of
      reality. So Irem of the Old Ones still exists in some form, and is not
      this great desert, this empty quarter connected to the void.? Cannot a
      Muqarribun interact with its unseen denizens in the Crimson Desert? </EM>
