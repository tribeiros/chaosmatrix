      most of these places are, for ye Old Ones came from ye Dark Stars.
      Tsathoggua was ye first, he came from dim Cykranosh not long after ye
      creation of life on this planet. His brother Vulthoom descended upon dying
      Mars. Great Cthulhu came hither next from distant dim green double star
      Xoth, with His Spawns, ye Deep Ones and ye Goddess-Bitch Shub-Niggurath
      followed them soon after from nightmare-rumored <A

      Hastur ye Unspeakable left dark <A

      to stain the soil of Earth in its prime. Fthaggua, dwelt on a world called
      Ktynga.
      <P>Of ye Old Ones, not all came on Earth. Ye Demon-Sultan Azathoth, Him
      Who Is Not To Be Named, lurks ever on that dark world near Aldebaran in ye
      Hyades. Likewise, Cthugha chose for His abode ye star Fomalhaut.
      <P>To visit such places, ye Traveller shall be patient. Only a few chosen
      are allowed to travel through time and space and see by themselves ye very
      places where They were born. Either madness or Death is the toll for such
      a journey. However, it is possible, as ye following chapters will show, to
      open Windows or Gates though which one may look upon Ye Dark Stars. Ye
      ritual has a risk though, for Ye Old Ones or Their Minions may feel your
      gaze and track you down unmercifully.

        in Damascus, circa 738 A.D. Of his final death or disappearance many
        terrible and conflicting things are told. He is said by Ebn Khallikan
        (12th century biographer) to have been siezed by an invisible monster in
        broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of
        fright-frozen witnesses. It is probable one of these "Watchers" finally
        found him.] </FONT></DD></DL>
      <P>Ye reader must be aware that The Old Ones are not the only makers of
      cyclopean cities. Mankind unexpectedly created the most beautiful
      countries, a place even Ancient Gods chose to rest peacefully. Some call
      that holly place, beyond the Silver Key Door, <A
