      <P><I>
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=7>E</FONT>ach night the dream comes, and I
      sink submerged into another mind, an alien form which toils in metal
      chambers cold, bizarre, amidst the teeming warren of a nightmare realm
      where insect- mages strive to pen below some monstrous peril scarcely
      glimpsed or named, which gnaweth ever the foundations of the world... O,
      Mother, Mother, ever the same dark dream!
      <P>Perched on the giddy brink of vertiginous chasms, elaborate metallic
      structures tremble and sway to subterranean tremors from beneath.
      Untiringly, we mages seek and search the pentacle- inscribed plates and
      scrolls fetched hither from far worlds and fabulous, but without finding
      that for which we seek. The ground shakes. We ignore it, and search on.
      <P>My nine claws trace inexplicable hieroglyphs acid-etched in perdurable
      metal. Through odd- angled apertures pour diverse solar colors in five
      distinct luminosities. Crouched on my prism, I ponder cantrips to hold at
      bay the bleached and viscous swine-snouted worms. On Nython and Mthura, my
      brethren barter for more potent ensorcellments. For lack of these must the
      Nug-Soth perish in the foundering of intricate metal cities? Alas, the
      Mother remains indifferent as to which of the races of her minions
      triumph!
      <P>For ages and ages beyond all reckoning have the great Dhole-things
      lurked beneath, in noisome burrows where they fed and grew, waxed huge and
      strong beyond belief. Now are their black and fetid nests below no longer
      large enough to any more contain such prodigious progeny. They thrust and
      lurch against the walls of thought-projected force that held at bay for
      aeons interminable the Doom of Yaddith. And the walls give way...
      <P>Through labyrinthine streets, under the burning suns, we gather to the
      meeting-place of minds. There the Arch-Ancient One exhorts of us redoubled
      labors holding strong the force which walls away the squirming
      burrow-spawn. And once again we float to dimmest Xoth, and trans-galactic
      Stronti. But in vain...
      <P>Sheathed in bent light, we drift to Kythamil or Kath. The fungoid
      intelligences of Nzoorl repulse our entreaties. Even should we migrate to
      a world remote from this, the snouted worms can track us through our
      dreams which call like beacons through the eldritch dark... Nor can our
      cantrips any more suffice to hold at bay the loathed, unwholesome Dholes
      we never shall escape or long elude!
      <P>Our far-fled brethren, empty of hand, return from Yarnak and from
      ill-rumored Ymar, and terrible Shaggai. They voyaged far to Vhoorl in the
      remotest nebulae, to Zaoth and Ktynga, and, at last, remotest Phenoth
      beyond space itself, where rules the Crawling Chaos. They return fetching
      not hither that for which they sought -- the runes to keep the gruesome
      worm-things pent.
      <P>From world to world our brother-mages went for stronger spells, ever
      more potent runes; and on cold Abbith, where the Metal Brains in crystal
      caverns cogitate long ages by, they learned a fearful lore: the spells
      arcane for which we quest were known of old on Yith and Yith is perished
      untold eons past... Ever we toil on under the five-hued light, knowing at
      last there is not any hope.
      <P>Under the shuddering aurorae of the north, where glaciers crawl the
      meteor strewn waste, the thought-waves bring to us a tale of doom for City
      Three is fallen, fallen... No more the larvae in the breeding-pits shall
      mewl and slither, the Nug-Soth no more may stroll the broad metallic
      esplanade, nor mages ponder tomes of elder lore. For City Three is fallen,
      fallen...
      <P>No more are the departure-stages thronged. Now in their thousands are
      the Nug-Soth fled, armoured in closed light against the bitter cold and
      utter blackness that yawns between the stars. The metal pavement quavers
      underfoot, the broken towers totter toward collapse. I am among the very
      last to leave. For few remain to hold the Dhole-swarm back.
      <P>Inscrutable. The Mighty Mother smiles over her fleeing, her
      star-scattered brood, as night falls over Yaddith at the end. We hurtle
      through the frigid gloom of space to Zaoth or Shaggai or Kythamil leaving
      behind the ruin of a world, and little hope have we to long survive. The
      awful doom of Yaddith we evade will soon be snuffling at our heels again
      -- The snouted worms can track us through our dreams. </I>
