      <P><IMG align=left alt=T src="img/cap_t.jpg">here is in ye land
      of Mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no stream, and out of which no
      stream flows. Ten thousand years ago there stood by its shore ye mighty
      city of Sarnath, but Sarnath stands there no more.
      <P>It is told that in ye immemorial years when ye world was young, before
      ever ye men of Sarnath came to ye land of Mnar, another city stood beside
      ye lake; ye gray stone city of Ib, which was old as ye lake itself, and
      peopled with beings not pleasing to behold. Very odd and ugly were these
      beings, as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely
      fashioned. It is written on ye brick cylinders of Kadatheron that ye
      beings of Ib were in hue as green as the lake and ye mists that rise above
      it; that they had bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curipus ears,
      and were without voice. It is also written that they descende one night
      from ye moon in a mist; they and ye vast still lake and gray stone city of
      Ib. However this may be, it is certain that they worshipped a sea-green
      stone idol chiseled in ye likeness of Bokrug, ye great water-lizard;
      before which they danced horribly when ye moon was gibbous. And it is
      written in ye papyrus of Ilarnek, that they one day discovered fire, and
      thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions. But not much is
      written of these beings, because they lived in very ancient times, and man
      is young, and knows little of ye very ancient living things.
      <P>After many eons men came to ye land of Mnar, dark shepherd folk with
      their fleecy flocks, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on ye
      winding river Ai. And certain tribes, more hardy than ye rest, pushed on
      to ye border of ye lake and built Sarnath at a spot where precious metals
      were found in ye earth.
      <P>Not far from ye gray stone city of Ib did ye wandering tribes lay ye
      first stones of Sarnath, and at ye beings of Ib they marveled greatly. But
      with their marveling was mixed hate, for they thought it not meet that
      beings of such aspect should walk about ye world of men at dusk. Nor did
      they like ye strange sculptures upon ye gray monoliths of Ib, for those
      sculptures lingered so late in ye world, even until ye coming men, none
      can tell; unless it was because ye land of Mnar is very still, and remote
      from most lands, both of waking and of dream.
      <P>As ye men of Sarnath beheld more of ye beings of Ib their hate grew,
      and it was not less because they found ye beings weak, and soft as jelly
      to ye touch of stones and arrows. So one day ye young warriors, ye
      slingers and ye spearmen and ye bowmen, marched against Ib and slew all ye
      inhabitants thereof, pushing ye queer bodies into ye lake with long
      spears, because they did not wish to touch them. And because they did not
      like ye gray sculptured monoliths of Ib they cast these also into ye lake;
      wondering from ye greatness of ye labor how ever ye stones were brought
      from afar, as they must have been, since there is naught like them in ye
      land of Mnar or in ye lands adjacent.
      <P>Thus of ye very ancient city of Ib was nothing spared, save ye seagreen
      idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, ye water-lizard. This ye young
      warriors took back with them as a symbol of conquest over ye old gods and
      beings of Ib, and as a sign of leadership in Mnar. But on ye night after
      it was set up in ye temple, a terrible thing must have happened, for weird
      lights were seen over ye lake, and in ye morning ye people found ye idol
      gone and ye high-priest Taran-Ish lying dead, as from some fear
      unspeakable. But before he had died, Taran-Ish had scrawled upon ye altar
      of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes ye sign of DOOM.
      <P>Many centuries came and went, wherein Sarnath prospered exceedingly, so
      that only priests and old women remembered what Taran-Ish had scrawled
      upon ye altar. As Sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful, it sent
      forth conquering armies to subdue ye neighboring cities; and in time there
      sate upon ye throne in Sarnath ye king of all ye land of Mnar and of many
      lands adjacent.
      <P>Lofty and amazing were ye seventeen tower-like temples of Sarnath,
      fashioned of a bright multi-colored stone not known elsewhere. On ye
      ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of ye palaces; where
      gathered throngs in worship of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon, ye chief
      gods of Sarnath, whose incense-enveloped shrines were as ye thrones of
      monarchs. And at the lake, at night, was done ye very secret and ancient
      rite in detestation of Bokrug, ye water-lizard, and here rested ye altar
      of chrysolite which bore ye doom-scrawl of Taran-Ish.
      <P>Each year was celebrated in Sarnath ye feast of ye destroying of Ib, at
      which time wine, song, dancing and merriment of every kind abounded. Great
      honors were then paid to ye shades of those who had annihilated ye odd
      ancient beings, and ye memory of those beings and of their elder gods,
      were derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from ye royal
      gardens. And ye king would look out over ye lake and curse ye bones of ye
      dead that lay beneath it.
      <P>Gorgeous beyond thought was ye feast of ye thousandth year of ye
      destroying of Ib. For a decade had it been talked of in ye land of Mnar,
      and as it drew nigh there came to Sarnath on horses and camels and
      elephants men of Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron, and all ye cities of Mnar
      and ye lands beyond. Before ye marble walls on ye appointed night were
      pitched the pavillions of princes and ye tents of travellers. Within his
      banquet-hall reclined Nargis-Hei, the king, drunken with ancient wine from
      ye vaults of conquered Pnoth, and surrounded by feasting nobles and
      hurrying slaves. Ther were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast;
      peacocks from ye distant hills of Implan, heels of camels from ye Bnazic
      desert, nuts and spices from Sydathrian groves, and pearls from
      wave-washed Mtal dissolved in ye vinegar of Thraa.
      <P>Whilst ye king and his nobles feasted within ye palace, priests held
      revels in ye tower of the great temple. And it was ye high-priest Gnai-Kah
      who first saw ye shadows that descended from ye gibbous moon into ye lake,
      and ye damnable green mists that arose from ye lake to meet ye moon and to
      shroud in a sinister haze ye towers and domes of fated Sarnath. Thereafter
      those in ye towers, and without ye walls beheld strange lights on ye
      water, and saw that the gray rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high
      above it near ye shore, was almost submerged. And fear grew vaguely yet
      swiftly, so that ye princes of Ilarnek and of far Rokol took down and
      folded their pavilions and departed, though they scarce knew ye reason for
      their departing.
      <P>Then, close to ye hour of midnight, all ye bronze gates of Sarnath
      burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened ye plain, so
      that all ye visiting princes and travellers fled away in fright. For on ye
      faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable, and on
      their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof. Men
      whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of ye sight within ye king's
      banquet-hall, where through ye windows were seen no longer ye forms of
      Nargis-Hei and his nobles and slaves, but a horde of indescibable green
      voiceless things with bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious
      ears; things which danced horribly, bearing in their paws golden platters
      set with rubies and diamonds and containing uncouth flames. And by now ye
      great gray rock Akurion was quite submerged. Through all the land of Mnar
      and ye land adjacent spread ye tales of those who fled from Sarnath, and
      caravans sought that accursed city no more. And where once had risen walls
      of three hundred cubits and towers yet higher, now stretched only ye
      marshy shore of ye vast still lake itself, and ye gray rock Akurion which
      rears high above it near ye shore. DOOM had come to Sarnath.
      <P>But half buried in ye rushes was spied a curious green idol; an
      exceedingly ancient idol chiseled in ye likeness of Bokrug, ye great
      Water-Lizard God. That idol, enshrined in ye high temple at Ilarnek, was
      susequently worshipped beneath ye gibbous moon throughout ye land of Mnar.
      And also, when ye tide is low, can be seen an inscription on ye gray rock
      Akurion which reads, in letters ancient, "Ib is gone but ye Gods live on.
      Across ye world is ye Sister City, Lh-yib, hidden in ye earth, in ye
      barbarous lands of Zimmeria. There Ye People, Ye Deep Ones, flourish yet
      and there will Ye Gods ever be worshipped; even unto ye coming of
      Cthulhu." </I>
