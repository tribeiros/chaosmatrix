      <DIV align=right><FONT color=#701010 size=2><BR>A hundred April winds
      disperse her fragrance, <BR>A thousand wet Octobers scour her footprints,
      <BR>The ruthless years assail the ancient memory of her presence, yet
      <BR>Where Yidhra walks the hills do not forget. </FONT></DIV><I>
      <P><IMG align=left alt=I src="img/cap_i.jpg">t is clear that the
      most ancient gods, the prototypes of all the gods of man, were known and
      worshipped before men existed; and it is further clear that the most
      ancient gods all proceed from the one source. That source is sometimes
      called Mlandoth, and all gods are but varied manifestations and extensions
      of the One. But whether Mlandoth is a place, or a conscious entity, or an
      inconceivable maelstrom of unknown forces and properties outside the
      perceptible cosmos is not known surely.
      <P>Certainaly Ngyr-Khorath, the mad and monstrous thing which haunted this
      region of space before the solar system was formed and haunts it still, is
      but a local eddy of the vastness that is Mlandoth. And is not fabled
      "Ymnar, the dark stalker and seducer of all Earthly intelligence," merely
      the arm of Ngyr-Khorath, an organ created in the image of Earthly life and
      consciousness to corrupt that life and lead it to its own destruction?
      <P>And does not even great Yidhra, who was born of and with the life of
      Earth and who through the aeons intertwines endlessly with all Earthly
      life-forms, teach reverence for Mlandoth?
      <P>Before death was born, She was born; and for untold ages there was life
      without death, life without birth, life unchanging. But at last death
      came; birth came; life became mortal and mutable, and thereafter fathers
      died, sons were born, and never was the son exactly as the father; and the
      slime became the worm and the worm the serpent, the serpent became the
      yeti of the mountain forests and the yeti became man. Of all living things
      only She escaped death, escaped birth. But She could not escape change,
      for all living things must change as the trees of the north must shed
      their leaves to live in winter and put them on to live in spring. And
      therefore She learned to devour the mortal and mutable creatures, and from
      their seed to change Herself , and to be as all mortal things as She
      willed, and to live forever without birth, without death.
      <P>Yidhra devoured the octopus and learned to put forth a tentacle; she
      devoured the bear and learned to cloth herself in fur against the creeping
      ice of the north; indeed can Yidhra take any shape known to living things.
      Yet no shape can she take which is truly fair, for she partakes of all
      foul creatures as well as fair. To her followers she appears in many fair
      and comely forms, but this is because they see not her true form, but only
      such visions as she wills them to see. For as the adepts can send their
      thoughts and visions to one another over great distances so can Yidhra
      send her thoughts to men and cause them to see only what she wills. Indeed
      it is by sending her thoughts that Yidhra remains in one soul, for in body
      she is many, hidden in the jungles of the south, the icy wastes of the
      north, and the deserts beyoun the western sea. Thus it is that though her
      temples are many, she waits by all, combining bodily with her diverse
      followers, yet her consciousness is a vast unity.
      <P>The Mad Lama of Prithom-Yang has written:
      <P></I>
      <CENTER><FONT color=#701010 size=2>Yidhra, the Lonely One, craving the

      and the harvest. <BR>Yidhra, the Lover, needing the seed of her followers;
      <BR>Lover, who must have the seed of all things, <BR>Lover, who must have
      the seed of change or die, <BR>Lover, whose consorts are changed,
      <BR>infused with the seed of the past and changed <BR>to forms not of past
