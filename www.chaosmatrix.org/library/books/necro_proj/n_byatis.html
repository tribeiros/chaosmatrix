      <P><IMG align=left alt=B src="img/cap_b.jpg">yatis, the
      serpent-bearded, the god of forgetfulness,son of Yig, came with the Great
      Old Ones from the stars, called by obeisances made to his image which was
      brought by the Deep Ones to Earth. He may be called by the touching of his
      image by a living being. His gaze brings darkness on the mind; and it is
      told that those who look upon his eyes will be forced to walk into his
      clutches. He feasts upon those who stray to him, and from those upon whom
      he feasts he draws a part of their vitality, and so grows vaster. For
      there is this about those images of the Great Old Ones brought down from
      the stars when all the Earth was young, that a psychic link connects such
      as Byatis or Han to their images, and they that worship the Great Old Ones
      and who serve them on this plane may communicate with their Masters
      through such ideals; but a fate darkling and terrible beyond belief is
      reserved for they who unwittingly possess such idols from Beyond, for them
      the Old Ones drain vitality through this psychic link, and their dreams
      are made hideous with nightmare glimpses of the Ultimate Pit. </I>
