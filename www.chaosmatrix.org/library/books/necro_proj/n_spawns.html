        were, the Old Ones are and the Old Ones shall be. From the dark stars
        They came ere man was born, unseen and loathsome They descended to
        primal earth. Beneath the oceans They brooded while ages past, till seas
        gave up the land, whereupon They swarmed forth in Their multitudes and
        darkness ruled the Earth.</DT></DL><BR clear=all>

      <P>
      <P>At the frozen Poles They raised mighty cities, and upon high places the
      temples of Those whome nature owns not and the Gods have cursed.
      <P>And the spawn of the Old Ones covered the Earth, and Their children
      endureth throughout the ages. Ye shantaks of Leng are the work of Their
      hands, the Ghasts who dwelleth in Zin's primordial vaults know Them as
      their Lords.
      <P>They have fathered the Na-Hag and the Gaunts that ride the Night; Great
      Cthulhu is Their brother, the shaggoths Their slaves. The Dholes do homage
      unto Them in the nighted vale of Pnoth and Gugs sing Their praises beneath
      the peaks of ancient Throk. <BR clear=all>
      <P>They have walked amidst the stars and They have walked the Earth. The
      City of Irem in the great desert has known Them; Leng in the Cold Waste
      has seen Their passing, the timeless citadel upon the cloud-vieled heights
      of unknown Kadath beareth Their mark.
      <P>Wantonly the Old Ones trod the ways of darkness and Their blasphemies
      were great upon the Earth; all creation bowed beneath Their might and knew
      Them for Their wickedness.
      <P>And the Elder Lords opened Their eyes and beheld the abominations of
      Those that ravaged the Earth. In Their wrath They set their hand against
      the Old Ones, staying Them in the midst of Their iniquity and casting Them
      forth from the Earth to the Void beyond the planes where chaos reigns and
      form abideth not. And the Elder Lords set Their seal upon the Gateway and
      the power of the Old Ones prevailest not against its might.
      <P><IMG align=left hspace=10 src="img/i_old2.jpg" vspace=10>
      <P>
      <P>Loathsome Cthulhu rose then from the deeps and raged with exceeding
      great fury against the Earth Guardians. And They bound his venomous claws
      with potent spells and sealed him up within the City of R'lyeh wherein
      beneath the waves he shall sleep death's dream until the end of the Aeon.
      <P>Beyond the Gate dwell now the Old Ones; not in the spaces known unto
      men but in the angles betwixt them. Outside Earth's plane They linger and
      ever awaite the time of Their return; for the Earth has known Them and
      shall know Them in time yet to come.
      <P>And the Old Ones hold foul and formless Azathoth for Their Master abd
      Abide with Him in the black cavern at the centre of all infinity, where he
      gnaws ravenously in ultimate chaos amid the mad beating of hidden drums,
      the tuneless piping of hideous flutes and the ceaseless bellowing of blind
      idiot gods that shamble and gesture aimlessly for ever.
      <P><IMG align=right hspace=10 src="img/i_old5.jpg" vspace=10>
      <P>The soul of Azathoth dwelleth in Yog-sothoth and He shall beckon unto
      the Old Ones when the stars mark the time of Their coming; for Yog-sothoth
      is the Gate through which Those of the Void will re-enter. Yog-sothoth
      knowest the mazes of of time, for all time is one unto Him. He knowest
      where the Old Ones came forth in time along long past and where They shall
      come forth again when the cycle returneth.
      <P>After day cometh night; man's day shall pass, and They shall rule where
      They once ruled. As foulness you shall know them and Their accursedness
      shall stain the Earth. <BR clear=all>
