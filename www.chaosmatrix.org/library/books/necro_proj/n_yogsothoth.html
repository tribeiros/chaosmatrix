      <P>When thou wouldst call up ye Globes thou must first make upon the earth
      this sign:
      <P>And evoke of them thus: <PRE>           EZPHARES, OLYARAM, IRION-ESYTION,
            ERYONA, OREA, ORASYM, MOZIM!
   </PRE><BR clear=all>
      <P>By these words and in the name of YOG-SOTHOTH who is thy master, I do
      most powerfulIy summon and call ye up <PRE>O . . . . N . . . .</PRE>That thou mayest aid me in my hour of need.
      <P>Come forth I command ye by the sign of Power!
      <P>(Make the sign of Voor)
      <P>And then the spirit shall appear unto thee and grant thy requests.
      <P>But if he remaineth invisible to thine eye, blow the dust of Ibn Ghazi
      and he will immediately take his proper form.
      <P>When thou wouldst banish what ye have called up eraze thou their sign
      with the scimitar of Barzai and utter the words: <PRE>            CALDULECH ! DALMALEY ! CADAT !

            (and seal with the sign of Koth).
   </PRE>
      <P>Nota: If on their appearance the spirits obstinately refuse to speak
      cleave the air thrice with the scimitar and say: ADRICANOROM DUMASO! And
      their tongue shall be loosened and they will be compelled to give true
      answer. </I>
