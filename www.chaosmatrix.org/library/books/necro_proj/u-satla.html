      <P><I><IMG align=left alt=U src="img/cap_u.jpg">bbo-Sathla is
      the source, the unbegotten beginning from whom came those who dared set
      themselves against the Elder Gods who ruled from Betelgueze, those who
      warred upon the Elder Gods, the Great Old Ones led by the blind idiot god,
      Azathoth, and Yog- Sothoth, who is All-in-One and One-in-All, and upon
      whom are no strictures of time or space, and whose agents are 'Umr
      At-Tawil and the Ancient Ones, who dream forever of that time when once
      again they shall rule, to whom rightfully belong Earth and the entire
      universe of which it is a part...
      <P>Great Cthulhu shall rise from R'lyeh, Hastur the Unspeakable shall
      return from the dark star which is in the Hyades near Aldebaran, the red
      eye of the bull, Nyarlathotep the messenger of the Ancient Ones shall howl
      forever in the darkness where he abideth, Shub-Niggurath shall spawn his
      thousand young, and they shall spawn in turn and shall take dominion over
      all wood nymphs, satyrs, and the Little People, Lloigor, Zhar, and Ithaqua
      shall ride the spaces among the stars, and those who serve them, the
      Tcho-Tcho, shall be ennobled, Cthugha shall encompass his dominion from
      Fomalhaut, and Tsathoggua shall come from N'kai. ...
      <P>They wait by the gates, for the time draws near, the hour is soon at
      hand, and the Elder Gods sleep, dreaming, and there are those who know the
      spells put upon the Great Old Ones by the Elder Gods, as there are those
      who shall learn how to break them, as already they know how to command the
      servants of those who wait beyond the door from Outside.
      <P>For Ubbo-Sathla is the source and the end. Before the coming of
      Tsathoggua or Yog- Sothoth or Cthulhu from the stars; Ubbo-Sathla dwelt in
      the steaming fens of the new- made Earth: a mass without head or members,
      spawning the gray, formless efts of the prime and the grisly prototypes of
      terrene life.....And all earthly life, it is told, shall go back at last
      through the great circle of time to Ubbo-Sathla. </I><BR
