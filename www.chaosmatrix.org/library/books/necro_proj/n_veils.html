      <P><IMG align=left alt=I src="img/cap_i.jpg">t should be noted
      that the Render is a fickle being, and thus this rite may not be performed
      with impunity. Though the means to its completion may be sought at any
      time, only when the magician is ready shall these tools come into his
      hands.
      <P>First, one must seek out the blessing of the Render through the gaining
      of one of His sacred images. The path of least hazard is to obtain one
      from another magician or priest, but I know of none in our land who hold
      these, and those who possess them are loath to part with them. If you
      despair of this, sometimes such eidolons may be found by the soul as it
      floats in trance through the Higher Realities. Indeed, some find the image
      of the Render in their visions without searching, but these occurrences
      are rare indeed. Those who possess the Crystallizer of Dreams will find
      this less taxing, but note what I have said elsewhere of that item.
      <P>Once the image is obtained, the rite may then commence. The summoning
      is best performed at night, as then the outline of the Render will be
      masked, and when the stars are in their proper places. Do not rely upon
      charts or records, for such matters are incomprehensible to mortals, but
      let the spirit within be the judge of the day and hour. It would be well
      if one would take on some companions in this task, that their vitality as
      well as the wizard's may be drawn forth for the Work.
      <P>First the wizard shall create the Pentacle of Planes. Though the twigs
      of the ash is best for this purpose, it may be made from other materials,
      or even drawn upon the ground if no other means are available, but be
      certain that there is not even a hairbreadth's crack in the design. Within
      this stricture place the cranium of one of the hideous lurkers of the
      tarns of Zemargad, and into this insert two candles made from the fat of
      the proper kind, one part of mandragora, three of ivy leaf, and one of
      salt. Place the image close by, though not within three cubits of the
      Pentacle itself.
      <P>Light the candles and take up an iron rod bearing on its end a drawn
      representation of the Render's shape as it appears to oneself. Having
      purified the area, strike this rod upon the ground and speak the
      following:
      <P>" Uthgos plam'f Daoloth asgu'i! O come forth Thou who sweepest aside
      the veils of perception, and showest the realities beyond. For it shall be
      here as it is in Yuggoth, in Tond as it is in Shaggai, in Poseidonis as it
      is in Yaddith-Gho, in Yian-Ho as it is in Tsan-Chan. The time of Thy
      coming is nigh, and the Abyss of the Night of Time is bridged. Make
      Thyself manifest in our spheres, that we may gain Thy knowledge and be
      edified thereby. Ia Th'ailog! K'thakluth m'khur'g ath'lys! Ia Daoloth!"
      <P>When the beacons have been snuffed and the Render has manifested
      himself within the Pentacle, he will reach forth and take what is
      necessary from those nearby. After this the wizard may question the Render
      how- soever it is desired. No banishment is necessary, for following the
      impartation of the knowledge and the departure of his time the Render
      shall withdraw back to the Veil Beyond the Abyss.
      <P>The following is most important. If any portion of the ritual, no
      matter how small, is not performed properly, it is best to conclude the
      ceremony forthwith before the Render manifests. If the candle flames burn
      yellow, it shows the favor of That Which Is Beyond. Make certain to
      perform the ceremony at the exact moment of the Veil's rending, for this
      time is brief. Be fluid with the motions and speak the words of invocation
      smoothly. Be certain that those who assist you are trustworthy and
      steadfast. It is of especial import that those who call out to the Veil
      should do so out of a genuine desire for knowledge and not mere curiosity,
      for That Which Is Beyond will give those whose search is for the latter
      exactly that which they desire.
      <P>Some have said that the Render may bestown the ability to perceive the
      true nature of the world, but such an experiment is extremely perilous to
      the mind and soul of he who would do so. The Atlantean high priest
      Klarkash-ton tells of an acolyte who attempted to do so, and met his death
      the the hands of his horrified fellows as they struck out at _what had
      grown within_. Considering this, such an act would be foolish for all but
      the mightiest sorcerers. </I>
