<H4>THE CHAPTER OF MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO A SWALLOW.</H4>The Osiris Ani,
whose word is truth, saith:- I am a swallow, [I am] a swallow. [I am] that
Scorpion, the daughter of Ra. Hail, O ye gods whose odour is sweet. Hail, O ye
gods whose odour is sweet. Hail, Flame, who comest forth from the horizon. Hail,
thou who art in the city. I have brought the Warder of his corner there. Give me
thy two hands, and let me pass my time in the Island of Flame. I have advanced
with a message, I have come having the report thereof [to make]. Open to me. How
shall I tell that which I have seen there? I am like Horus, the governor of the
Boat, when the throne of his father was given unto him, and when Set, that son
of Nut, was [lying] under the fetters which he had made for Osiris. He who is in
Sekhem hath inspected me. I stretch out my arms over Osiris. I have advanced for
the examination, I have come to speak there. Let me pass on and deliver my
message. I am he who goeth in, [I am] judged, [I] come forth magnified at the
Gate of Nebertcher. I am purified at the Great Uart. I have done away my
wickednesses. I have put away utterly my offences. I have put away utterly all
the taints of evil which appertained to me [upon the earth]. I have purified
myself, I have made myself to be like a god. Hail, O ye Doorkeepers, I have
completed my journey. I am like unto you. I have come forth by day. I have
advanced on my legs. I have gained the master over [my] footsteps. [Hail, ye]
Spirit-souls! I, even I, do know the hidden roads and the Gates of Sekhet Aaru.
I live there. Verily, I, even I, have come, I have overthrown my enemies upon
the earth, although my body lieth a mummy in the tomb.
