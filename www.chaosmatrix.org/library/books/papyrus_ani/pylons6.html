<H3>THE PYLONS OF THE HOUSE OF OSIRIS</H3>The following shall be said when one
cometh to the SIXTH PYLON. The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth,
saith: "Lady of light, who roareth mightily, whose breadth cannot be
comprehended. Her like hath not been found since the beginning. There are
serpents over which are unknown. They were brought forth before the
Still-Heart." The name of her Doorkeeper is Semati.
