<BODY><I>(From the Saite Recension)</I></A>
<H4>THE BOOK OF MAKING PERFECT THE KHU</H4>in the heart of Ra, of making him to
have the mastery before Tem, of magnifying him before Osiris, of making him
mighty before Khent-Amentet, and of setting awe of him before the Company of the
Gods. It shall be recited on the day of the New Moon, on the sixth day festival,
on the fifteenth day festival, on the festival of Uak, on the festival of Thoth,
on the Birthday of Osiris, on the festival of Menu, on the night of Heker,
[during] the Mysteries of the Tuat, during the celebration of the Mysteries in
Akertet, at the smiting of the emissions, at the passage of the Funerary Valley,
[and] the Mysteries...... [The recital thereof] will make the heart of the Khu
to flourish and will make long his strides, and will make him to advance, and
will make his face bright, and will make it to penetrate to the God. Let no man
witness [the recital] except the king and the Kherheb priest, but the servant
who cometh to minister outside shall not see it. Of the Khu for whom this Book
shall be recited, his soul shall come forth by day with the living, he shall
have power among the gods, and it will make him irresisitible for ever and ever.
These gods shall go round about him, and shall acknowledge him. He shall be one
of them. [This Book] shall make him to know how he came into being in the
beginning. This Book is indeed a veritable mystery. Let no stranger anywhere
have knowledge of it. Do not speak about it to any man. Do not repeat it. Let no
[other] eye see it. Let no [other] ear hear it. Let no one see it except
[thyself] and him who taught [it to thee]. Let not the multitude [know of it]
except thyself and the beloved friend of thy heart. Thou shalt do this book in
the seh chamber on a cloth painted with the stars in colour all over it. It is
indeed a mystery. The dwellers in the swamps of the Delta nad everywhere there
shall not know it. It shall provided the Khu with celestial food upon in
Khert-Neter. It shall supply his Heart-soul with food upon earth. It shall make
him to live for ever. No [evil] thing shall have the master over him.
