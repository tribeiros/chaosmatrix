<BODY>APPENDIX <I>(From the Saite Recension, ed. Lepsius, Bl. V)</I>
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who comest as Tem, who didst come into being to create
the Company of the Gods.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who comest as the Soul of Souls, the Holy One in
Amentet.
<P>Homage to thee, O President of the Gods, who illuminest the Tuat with thy
beauties.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who comest as the Light-god, who travellest in thy
Disk.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou greatest of all gods, who are crowned King in heaven,
Governor in the Tuat.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who makest a way through the Tuat, who dost lead the
way through all doors.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who art among the gods, who dost weigh words in
Khert-Neter.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who dwellest in thy secret places, who dost fashion
the Tuat with thy might.
<P>Homage to thee, O great one, O mighty one, thine enemies have fallen in
places where they were smitten.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who hast hacked the Sebau-fiends in pieces, and hast
annihilated Aapep.
<P>Grant thou the sweet breeze of the north wind to the Osiris Auf-ankh, whose
word is truth.
<P>
