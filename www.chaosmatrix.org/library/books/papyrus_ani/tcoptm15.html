<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART-CASE OF A MAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM IN
KHERT-NETER.</H4>The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, ye who steal and crush heart-cases
[and who make the heart of a man to go through its transformations according to
his deeds: let not what he hath done harm him before you]. Homage to you, O ye
Lords of Eternity, ye masters of everlastingness, take ye not this heart of
Osiris Ani into your fingers, and this heart-case, and cause ye not things of
evil to spring up against it, because this heart belongeth to the Osiris Ani,
and this heart-case belongeth to him of the great names (Thoth), the mighty one,
whose words are his members. He sendeth his heart to rule his body, and his
heart is renewed before the gods. The heart of the Osiris Ani, whose word is
truth, is to him; he hath gained the mastery over it. He hath not said what he
hath done. He hath obtained power over his own members. His heart obeyeth him,
he is the lord thereof, it is in his body, and it shall never fall away
therefrom. I command thee to be obedient unto me in Khert-Neter. I, the Osiris
Ani, whose word is truth, in peace; whose word is truth in the Beautiful
Amentet, by the Domain of Eternity.
