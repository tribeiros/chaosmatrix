<H1>THE TEXTS IN THE FUNERAL CHAMBER</H1>APPENDIX 
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu and the Papyrus of Nebseni)</I> 
<P>The Speech of Anpu: Anubis the dweller in the mummy chamber, Governor of the 
Divine House, layeth his hands upon the lord of life, the scribe, the 
draughtsman of Ptah, Nebseni, the lord of fealty, begotten of the scribe and 
mason Thena, born of the lady of the house Mut-rest, whose word is truth, and 
devoting himself to him as his guardian, saith:- Homage to thee, thou happy one, 
lord! Thou seest the Utchat. Ptah-Seker hath bound thee up. Anpu hath exalted 
thee. Shu hath raised thee up, O Beautiful Face, thou governor of eternity. Thou 
hast thine eye, O scribe Nebseni, lord of fealty, and it is beautiful. Thy right 
eye is like the Sektet Boat, thy left eye is like the Atet Boat. Thine eyebrows 
are fair to see in the presence of the Company of the Gods. Thy brow is under 
the protection of Anpu, and thy head and face, O beautiful one, are before the 
holy Hawk. Thy fingers have been stablished by thy scribe's craft in the 
presence of the Lord of Khemenu, Thoth, who hath bestowed upon thee the 
knowledge of the speech of the holy books. Thy beard is beautiful in the sight 
of Ptah-Seker, and thou, O scribe Nebseni, thou lord of fealty, art beautiful 
before the Great Company of the Gods. The Great God looketh upon thee, and he 
leadeth thee along the path of happiness. Sepulchral meals are bestowed upon 
thee, and he overthroweth for thee thine enemies, setting them under thy feet in 
the presence of the Great Company of the Gods who dwell in the House of the 
Great Aged One which is in Anu.
