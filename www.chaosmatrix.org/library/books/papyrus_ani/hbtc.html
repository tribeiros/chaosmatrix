<H4>[HERE] BEGIN THE CHAPTERS OF SEKHET-HETEPET, AND THE CHAPTERS OF COMING
FORTH BY DAY, OF ENTERING INTO AND COMING FORTH FROM KHERT-NETER, OF ARRIVING IN
SEKHET-AANRU, AND OF LIVING IN PEACE IN THE GREAT CITY, THE LADY OF
WINDS.</H4>[The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:-] Let me be
master there. Let me be a khu there. Let me plough there. Let me reap there. Let
me eat there. Let me drink there. [Let me beget there]. Let me do there all the
things which one doeth upon earth. The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, saith:-
Horus vanquished Set when [he] looked at the building of Sekhet-Hetepet. [He]
spread air over the Divine Soul in its Egg, in its day. He delivered the
interior of the body of Horus [from the Akeru Gods]. I have crowned him in the
House of Shu. His house is the stars. Behold, I take up my place in its nomes.
He hath guided the hearts of the Company of the Firstborn Gods. He hath
reconciled the Two Fighters (Horus and Set), the guardians of life. He hath done
what is fair, bringing an offering. He hath reconciled the Two Fighters with him
that belongeth to them. He hath cut off the hairy scalp of the Two Fighters. He
hath destroyed the revolts of [their] children. I have done away all the evil
which attacked their souls. I am master in [Sekhet-Hetepet]. I know it. I have
sailed over its lakes that I might arrive at the cities thereof. I have made
strong my mouth. The Spirit-souls are ready [to fight], but they shall not gain
the mastery over me. I am equipped in thy Fields, O god Hetep. What thou wishest
thou shalt do, [saith this god].
