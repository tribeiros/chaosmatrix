<H4>THE CHAPTER OF GIVING A HEART TO THE OSIRIS ANI IN KHERT-NETER.</H4>He
saith:- Let my heart be with me in the House of Hearts. Let my heart-case be
with me in the House of heart-cases. Let my heart be with me, and let it rest in
[me or] I shall not eat the cakes of Osiris in the eastern side of the Lake of
Flowers, nor have a boat wherein to float down the river, nor a boat to sail up
the river to thee, nor be able to embark in a boat with thee. Let my mouth be to
me that I may speak therewith. Let my legs be to me that I may walk therewith.
Let my arms be to me that I may overthrow the foe therewith. Let the two doors
of the sky be opened to me. May Keb, the Erpat of the gods, open his jaws to me.
May he open my two eyes which are blinded by swathings. May he make me to lift
up my legs in walking which are tied together. May Anpu make my thighs to become
vigorous. May the goddess Sekhmet raise me, and lift me up. Let me ascend into
heaven, let that which I command be performed in Het-ka-Ptah. I know how to use
my heart. I am master of my heart-case. I am master of my hands and arms. I am
master of my legs. I have the power to do that which my KA desireth to do. My
Heart-soul shall not be kept a prisoner in my body at the gates of Amentet when
I would go in in peace and come forth in peace.
