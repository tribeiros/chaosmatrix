<BODY>APPENDIX <I>(The following is from the Papyrus of Nefer-uben-f, Naville,
op. cit., I, Bl. 72.)</I>

<H4>THE CHAPTER OF DRINKING WATER IN KHERT-NETER.</H4>The am khent priest,
Nefer-uben-f, whose word is truth, saith:- I, even I, am he who cometh forth
from the god Keb. The water-flood is given to him, he hath become the master
thereof in the form of Hapi. I, the am khent Nefer-uben-f, open the doors of
heaven. Thoth hath opened to me the doors of Qebh (the Celestial Waters). Lo,
Hepi Hepi, the two sons of the Sky, mighty in splendour, grant ye that I may be
master over the water, even as Set had dominion over his evil power on the day
of the storming of the Two Lands. I pass by the Great Ones, arm to shoulder,
even as they pass that Great God, the Spirit who is equipped, whose name is
unknown. I have passed by the Aged One of the shoulder. I am Nefer-uben-f, whose
word is truth. Hath opened to me the Celestial Water Osiris. Hath opened to me
the Celestial Water Thoth-Hapi, the Lord of the horizon, in his name of "Thoth,
cleaver of the earth." I am master of the water, as Set is master of his weapon.
I sail over the sky, I am Ra, I am Ru. I am Sma. I have eaten the Thigh, I have
seized the bone and flesh. I go round about the Lake of Sekhet-Ar. Hath been
given to me eternity without limit. Behold, I am the heir of eternity, to whom
hath been given everlastingness.
