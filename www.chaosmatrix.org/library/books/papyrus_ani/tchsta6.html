<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT GOING IN TO THE BLOCK OF THE GOD.</H4>The Osiris Ani
saith:- My head was fastened on my body in heaven, O Guardian of the Earth, by
Ra. [This] was granted [to me] on the day of my being stablished, when I rose up
out of a state of weakness upon [my] two feet. On the day of cutting off the
hair Set and the Company of the Gods fastened my head to my neck, and it became
as firm as it was originally. Let nothing happen to shake it off again! Make ye
me safe from the murderer of my father. I have tied together the Two Earths. Nut
hath fastened together the vertebrae of my neck, and [I] behold them as they
were originally, and they are seen in the order wherein they were when as yet
Maat was not seen, and when the gods were not born in visible forms. I am Penti.
I am the heir of the great gods, I the Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is
truth.
