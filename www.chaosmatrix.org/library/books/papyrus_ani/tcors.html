<H2>THE CHAPTER OF REPULSING SLAUGHTER IN HENSU</H2><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu,
Sheet 6)</I>
<P>
<H4>THE CHAPTER OF DRIVING BACK THE SLAUGHTERS WHICH ARE PERFORMED IN
HENSU.</H4>The Osiris Nu, whose word is truth, saith:- O thou land of the
Sceptre! O thou White Crown of the divine form! O thou rest of the ferry-boat! I
am the Child. (Repeat four times). Hail, Abu-ur! Thou sayest daily: "The
slaughter-block is made ready as thou knowest, and thou hast come to
destruction." I am Ra, who stablisheth those who praise him. I am the Knot of
the god in the Aser tree, the twice beautiful one, who is more splendid to-day
than yesterday. (Repeat four times). I am Ra, who stablisheth those who praise
him. I am the Knot of the god within the Aser tree, and my appearance is the
appearance [of Ra] on this day.
<P>My hair is the hair of Nu. My face is the face of the Disk. My eyes are the
eyes of Hathor. My ears are the ears of Up-uat. My nose is the nose of
Khenti-Khabas. My lips are the lips of Anpu. My teeth are the teeth of Serqet.
My cheeks are the cheeks of the goddess Isis. My hands are the hands of
Ba-neb-Tet. My forearms are the forearms of Neith, the Lady of Sais. My backbone
is the backbone of Suti. My phallus is the phallus of Beba. My reins are the
reins of the Lords of Kher-aha. My chest is the chest of Aa-shefit. My belly and
back are the belly and back of Sekhmet. My buttocks are the buttocks of the Eye
of Horus. My hips and legs are the hips and legs of Nut. My feet are the feet of
Ptah. [My fingers] and my toes are the [fingers and] toes of the Living gods.
There is no member of my body which is not the member of a god. Thoth protecteth
my body altogether, and I am Ra day by day. I shall not be dragged back by my
arms, and none shall lay violent hold upon my hands. And shall do me hurt
neither men, nor gods, nor the Spirit-souls, nor the dead, nor any man, nor any
pat-spirit, nor any rekhit-spirit, nor any hememet-spirit. I am he who cometh
forth advancing, whose name is unknown. I am Yesterday. "Seer of Millions of
Years" is my name. I pass along, I pass along the paths of the divine celestial
judges. I am the Lord of Eternity: I decree and I judge like Khepera. I am the
Lord of the Urrt Crown. I am he who dwelleth in the Utchat and in the Egg, and
it is granted unto me to live therein. I am he who dwelleth in the Utchat when
it closeth, and I exist by the strength thereof. I come forth and I shine; I
enter in and I come to life. I am in the Utchat, my seat is upon my throne, and
I sit in the tent chamber before it. I am Horus. [I] traverse millions of years.
I have decreed [the stablishing] of my throne, and I am the ruler thereof; and
in very truth my mouth keepeth an even balance both in speech and in silence. In
very truth my forms are inverted. I am Un-Nefer, from one period even unto
another, and what I have is within me. I am the only One, who proceedeth from an
only One, who goeth round about in his course. I am he who dwelleth in the
Utchat. No evil thing of any shape or kind shall spring up against me, and no
baleful object, and no harmful thing, and no disastrous thing shall happen unto
me. I open the door in heaven. I rule my throne. I open the way for the births
which take place on this day. I am the child who traverseth the road of
Yesterday. I am To-day for untold nations and peoples. I am he who protecteth
you for millions of years. Whether ye be denizens of heaven, or of the earth, or
of the South, or of the North, or of the East, or of the West, the fear of me is
in your bodies. I am he whose being hath been wrought in his eye. I shall not
die again. My moment is in your bodies, but my forms are in my place of
habitation. I am "He who cannot be known." The Red Fiends have their faces
directed against me. I am the unveiled one. The period when the heavens were
created for me and were enlarged the bounds of earth, and multiplied the progeny
thereof, cannot be found out. They shall fail and not be united again. By reason
of the speech which I address to you, my name setteth itself apart from all
things evil which are in the mouths of men. I am he who riseth and shineth, a
wall which cometh out of a wall, an only One who proceedeth from an only One.
There is never a day that passeth without the things which appertain unto him
being therein; passing, passing, passing, passing. Verily I say unto thee, I am
the Plant which cometh forth from Nu, and my mother is Nut. Hail, my creator, I
am he who hath no power to walk, the Great Knot who dwelleth in Yesterday. The
might of my strength is within my hand, I am not known [by thee], but I am he
who knoweth thee. I cannot be held in the hand, but I am he who can hold thee in
his hand. Hail, O Egg! Hail, O Egg! I am Horus who liveth for millions of years,
whose flame shineth upon you, and bringeth your hearts unto me. I am master of
my throne. I advance at this season. I have opened a path. I have delivered
myself from all evil things. I am the golden dog-headed ape, three palms and two
fingers [high], which hath neither arms nor legs, and which dwelleth in
Het-ka-Ptah. I go forth as goeth forth the dog-headed ape who dwelleth in
Het-ka-Ptah.
<P><I>Behold the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, arrayed in fine linen, and
shod with sandals of white [leather], and anointed with the very finest myrrh
unguent. There are offered unto him a fine bull, and incense, and ra geese, and
flowers, and ale, and cakes, and garden herbs. And behold, thou shalt draw a
representation of a table of offerings on a clean tile with pure colours, and
thou shalt bury it in a field whereon no swine hath trodden. And if a copy of
this book be written upon it, he shall rise [again], and his children's children
shall flourish and prosper, like unto Ra, without cessation. He shall be in high
favour with the king, and with the shenit nobles of his court, and there shall
be given unto him cakes and cups of drink, and portions of flesh, upon the
altar-table of the Great God. He shall not thrust aside at any door in Amentet;
he shall travel in the train of the Kings of the South and the Kings of the
North, and he shall abide with the followers of Osiris near Un-Nefer, for ever,
and for ever, and for ever.</I>
<P>
<H4>Vignette</H4><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 24)</I>
<P>The steward of the overseer of the seal, Nu, whose word is truth, begotten of
the steward of the overseer of the seal, Amen-hetep, whose word is truth,
saith:- Hail, ye Four Apes who sit in the bows of the Boat of Ra, who convey
truth to Nebertcher, who sit in judgment on the oppressed man and on [his]
oppressor, who make the gods to be contented by means of the flame of your
mouths, who offer holy offerings to the gods, and sepulchral meals to the
Spirit-souls, who live upon truth, and who feed upon truth of heart, who are
without deceit and fraud, and to whom wickedness is an abomination, do ye away
with my evil deeds, and put ye away my sins [which deserved stripes upon earth,
and destroy ye every evil thing which appertaineth to me], and let there be no
obstacle whatsoever on my part towards you. O grant ye that I may make my way
through the Amehet, let me enter into Rasta, let me pass through the hidden
pylons of Ament. O grant that there may be given unto me shens cakes, and ale,
and persen cakes, even as to the living Spirit-souls, and grant that I may enter
into and come forth from Rasta.
<P>[The Four Apes make answer, saying]: Come thou, for we have done away with
thy wickedness, and we have put away thy sin, along with thy sins upon earth
which deserved stripes, and we have destroyed every evil thing which appertained
to thee upon earth. Enter, therefore, unto Rasta, and pass through the hidden
pylons of Amentet, and there shall be given unto thee shens cakes, and ale, and
persen cakes, and thou shalt come forth and shalt enter in at thy desire, even
as do those who are favoured [of the God], and thou shalt be called [to partake
of offerings] each day in the horizon.
<P>
