<H4>THE CHAPTER OF MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO PTAH.</H4>The Osiris Ani
[whose word is truth, saith]:- I eat bread. I drink ale. I gird up my garments.
I fly like a hawk. I cackle like the Smen goose. I alight upon that place hard
by the Sepulchre on the festival of the Great God. That which is abominable,
that which is abominable I will not eat. [An abominable thing] is filth, I will
not eat thereof. That which is an abomination unto my KA shall not enter my
body. I will live upon that whereon live the gods and the Spirit-souls. I shall
live, and I shall be master of their cakes. I am master of them, and I shall eat
them under the trees of the dweller in the House of Hathor, my Lady. I will make
an offering. My cakes are in Tetu, my offerings are in Anu. I gird about myself
the robe which is woven for me by the goddess Tait. I shall stand up and sit
down in whatsoever place it pleaseth me to do so. My head is like unto that of
Ra. I am gathered together like Tem.
<P>Here offer the four cakes of Ra, and the offerings of the earth. I shall come
forth. My tongue is like that of Ptah, and my throat is like unto that of
Hathor, and I remember the words of Tem, of my father, with my mouth. He forced
the woman, the wife of Keb, breaking the heads near him; therefore was the fear
of him there. [His] praises are repeated with vigour. I am decreed to be the
Heir, the lord of the earth of Keb. I have union with women. Keb hath refreshed
me, and he hath caused me to ascend his throne. Those who dwell in Anu bow their
heads to me. I am [their] Bull, I am stronger than [the Lord] of the hour. I
unite with women. I am master for millions of years.
<P>
