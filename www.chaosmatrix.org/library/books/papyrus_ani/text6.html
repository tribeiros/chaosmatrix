<H2>TEXTS RELATING TO THE WEIGHING OF THE HEART OF ANI</H2>
<H4>THE SPEECH OF HORUS TO OSIRIS IN INTRODUCING ANI TO HIM:-</H4>Horus, the son
of Isis, saith: I have come to thee, O Un-Nefer, and I have brought unto thee
the Osiris Ani. His heart is righteous, and it hath come forth from the Balance;
it hath not sinned against any god or any goddess. Thoth hath weighed it
according to the decree pronounced unto him by the Company of the Gods, and it
is most true and righteous. Grant thou that cakes and ale may be given unto him,
and let him appear in the presence of the god Osiris, and let him be like into
the Followers of Horus for ever and ever.
<P>
