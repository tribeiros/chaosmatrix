<H4>THE FOLLOWING IS TO BE RECITED ON THE DAY OF THE MONTH (NEW MOON</A>
DAY).</H4>The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, in peace, whose word
is truth, saith:- Ra ascendeth his throne on his horizon, and the Company of his
Gods follow in his train. The God cometh forth from his hidden place, [and]
tchefau food falleth from the eastern horizon of heaven at the word of Nut. They
(the gods) rejoice over the paths of Ra, the Great Ancestor [as] he journeyeth
round about. Therefore art thou exalted, O Ra, the dweller in thy Shrine. Thou
swallowest the winds, thou drawest into thyself the north wind, thou eatest up
the flesh of thy seat on the day when thou breathest truth. Thou dividest [it
among] the gods who are [thy] followers. [Thy] Boat saileth on travelling among
the Great Gods at thy word. Thou countest thy bones, thou gatherest together thy
members, thou settest thy face towards Beautiful Amentet, and thou comest there,
being made new every day. Behold, thou art that Image of Gold, thou hast the
unitings of the disks of the sky, thou hast quakings, thou goest round about,
and art made new each day. Hail! There is rejoicing in the horizon! The gods who
dwell in the sky descend the ropes [of thy Boat] when they see the Osiris Ani,
whose word is truth, they ascribe praise unto him as unto Ra. The Osiris Ani is
a Great Chief. [He] seeketh the Urrt Crown. His provisions are apportioned to
him- the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth. [His] fate is strong from the exalted
body of the Aamu gods, who are in the presence of Ra. The Osiris Ani, whose word
is truth, is strong on the earth and in Khert-Neter. O Osiris Ani, whose word is
truth, wake up, and be strong like unto Ra every day. The Osiris Ani, whose word
is truth, shall not tarry, he shall not remain motionless in this land for ever.
Right well shall he see with his two eyes, right well shall he hear with his two
ears, the things which are true, the things which are true. The Osiris Ani,
whose word is truth, is in Anu, the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, is as Ra,
and he is exalted by reason of [his] oars among the Followers of Nu. The Osiris
Ani, whose word is truth, cannot tell what he hath seen [or] narrate [what he
hath heard] in the House of the God of Mysteries. Hail! Let there be shouts of
acclamation of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, the divine body of Ra in the
Boat of Nu, who beareth propitiatory offerings for the KA of the god of that
which he loveth. The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in peace, whose word is
truth, is like Horus, the mighty one of transformations.
<P><I>This Chapter is to be recited over a boat seven cubits long, made of green
stone of the Tchatchau. Make a heaven of stars, and purify it and cleanse it
with natron and incense. Make then a figure of Ra upon a tablet of new stone in
paint, and set it in the bows of the boat. Then make a figure of the deceased
whom thou wilt make perfect, [and place it] in the boat. Make it to sail in the
Boat of Ra, and Ra himself shall look upon it. Do not these things in the
presence of any one except thyself, or thy father, or thy son. Then let them
keep guard over their faces, and they shall see the deceased in Khert-Neter in
the form of a messenger of Ra.</I>
