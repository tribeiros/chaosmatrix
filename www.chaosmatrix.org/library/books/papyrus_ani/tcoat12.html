<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu)</I>
<P>That which is an abomination unto me is death; let me not go into the chamber
of torture which is in the Tuat. I am the delight of the Khu of Osiris. I make
to be content the heart[s] of those who dwell among the divine things which are
beloved [by me]. They cause the fear of me [to abound], they create the awe of
me to be in those divine beings who dwell in their own circles. Behold, I am
exalted on my own standard, and upon my throne, and upon my seat which is
assigned [to me]. I am the god Nu, and those who commit sin shall not destroy
me. I am the firstborn of the primeval god, and my soul is the Souls of the
Eternal Gods, and my body is Everlastingness. My created form is [that of] the
god Eternity, the Lord of Years, and the Prince of Everlastingness. I am the
Creator of the Darkness, who maketh his seat in the uttermost limits of the
heavens, [which] I love. I arrive at their boundaries. I advance upon my two
legs. I direct my resting place. I sail over the sky. I fetter and destroy the
hidden serpents which are about my footsteps [in going to] the Lord of the Two
Arms. My soul is the Souls of the Eternal Gods, and my body is Everlastingness.
I am the exalted one, the Lord of the Land of Tebu. I am the Child in the city:
"Young man in the country" is my name. "Imperishable one" is my name. I am the
Soul Creator of Nu. I make my habitation in Khert-Neter. My nest is invisible,
my egg is not broken. I have done away the evil which is in me. I shall see my
Father, the Lord of the Evening. His body dwelleth in Anu. I am made to be the
Light-god, a dweller in the Light-god, over the Western Domain of the Hebt bird.

<P>APPENDIX

<P><I>RUBRIC: If this Chapter be known [by the deceased], he will live like a
perfect Spirit-soul in Khert-Neter; no evil thing whatsoever shall overthrow
him.</I>
