<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nekhtu-Amen, ed. Naville, I, 5)</I>
<P>THE CHAPTER OF MAKING THE SAHU TO ENTER THE TUAT ON THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL,
WHEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS ARE TO BE SAID: Homage to thee, O thou who dwellest in
the Holy Hill (Set-Tchesert) of Amentet! the Osiris, the royal scribe,
Nekhtu-Amen, whose word is true, knoweth thee, he knoweth thy name. Deliver thou
him from the worms which are in Ra-stau, which live upon the bodies of men and
women, and feed upon their blood, for Osiris, the favoured servant of the god of
his city, the royal scribe Nekhtu-Amen, knoweth you, and he knoweth your names.
Let the order for his protection be the first command of Osiris, the Lord to the
Uttermost Limit, who keepeth his body hidden. May he give him release from the
Terrible One who dwelleth at the bend of the River of Amentet, and may he decree
the acts that will make him to rise up. Let him pass on to him whose throne is
placed within the darkness, who giveth light in Ra-stau. O thou Lord of Light,
come thou and swallow up the worms which are in Amentet. Let the Great God who
dwelleth in Tetu, and who is himself unseen, hear his prayers, and let those who
cause afflictions hold him in fear as he cometh forth with the sentence of their
doom to the Divine Block. I the Osiris, the royal scribe, Nekhtu-Amen, come,
bearing the decree of Neb-er-tcher, and I am the Horus who taketh possession of
his throne for him. His father, the lord of all those who are in the Boat of his
Father Horus, hath ascribed praise unto him. He cometh bearing tidings.......
let him see the town of Anu. Their chief shall stand on the earth before him,
the scribes shall magnify him at the doors of their assemblies, and thy shall
swathe im with swathings in Anu. He hath led heaven captive, and he hath seized
the earth in his grasp. Neither the heavens nor the earth can be taken away from
him, for, behold, he is Ra, the firstborn of the gods. His mother shall nurse
him, and shall give him her breast on the horizon.
