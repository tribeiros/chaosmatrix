<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 13)</I>
<P>Hail, thou god Tem, who comest forth from the Great Deep, who shinest
gloriously under the form of the twin Lion-gods, send forth with might thy words
unto those who are in thy presence, and let the Osiris Nu enter into their
assembly. He hath performed the decree which hath been spoken to the mariners at
eventide, and the Osiris Nu, whose word is truth, shall live after his death,
even as doth Ra every day. Behold, most certainly Ra was born yesterday, and the
Osiris Nu was born yesterday. And every god shall rejoice in the life of the
Osiris Nu, even as they rejoice in the life of Ptah, when he appeareth from the
Great House of the Aged One which is in Anu.
<P>
