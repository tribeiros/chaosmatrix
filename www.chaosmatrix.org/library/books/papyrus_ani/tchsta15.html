<H4>THE CHAPTER OF FORCING A WAY INTO THE TUAT.</H4>The Am Khent priest
Nefer-uben-f, whose word is truth, saith:- Hail, Soul, thou mighty one of
terror. Behold, I have come unto thee. I see thee. I have forced a way through
the Tuat. I see my father Osiris. I drive away the darkness. I love him. I have
come. I see my father Osiris. He hath counted the heart of Set. I have made
offerings for my father Osiris. I have opened all the ways in heaven and on
earth. I love him. I have come. I have become a Spirit-body and a Spirit-soul,
who is equipped. Hail, every god and every Spirit-soul, I have made the ways. I
am Thoth....
