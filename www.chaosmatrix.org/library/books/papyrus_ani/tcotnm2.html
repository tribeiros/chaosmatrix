<H4>A HYMN TO RA [WHICH IS TO BE SUNG] ON THE DAY OF THE MONTH (THE DAY OF THE
NEW MOON) [WHEN] THE BOAT OF RA SAILETH</H4>. [The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose
word is truth, saith:-] Homage to thee, O thou who dwellest in thy Boat. Thou
rollest on, thou rollest on, thou sendest forth light, thou sendest forth light.
Thou decreest rejoicing for [every] man for millions of years unto those who
love him. Thou givest [thy] face to the Hememet spirits, thou god Khepera who
dwellest in thy Boat. Thou hast overthrown the Fiend Aapep. O ye Sons of Keb,
overthrow ye the enemies of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, and the fiends
of destruction who would destroy the Boat of Ra. Horus hath cut off your heads
in heaven. Ye who were in the forms of geese, your navel strings are on the
earth. The animals are set upon the earth..... in the form of fish. Every male
fiend and every female fiend shall be destroyed by the Osiris Ani, whose word is
truth. Whether the fiends descend from out of heaven, or whether they come forth
from the earth, or whether they advance on the waters, or whether they come from
among the Star-gods, Thoth, [the son of Aner], coming forth from Anerti shall
hack them to pieces. And the Osiris Ani shall make them silent and dumb. And
behold ye, this god, the mighty one of slaughters, the terror of whom is most
great, shall wash himself clean in your blood, and he shall bathe in your gore,
and ye shall be destroyed by the Osiris Ani in the Boat of his Lord Ra-Horus.
The heart of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, shall live. His mother Isis
giveth birth to him, and Nephthys nurseth him, just as Isis gave birth to Horus,
and Nephthys nursed him. [He] shall repulse the Smait fiends of Suti. They shall
see the Urrt Crown stablished upon his head, and they shall fall down upon their
faces [and worship him]. Behold, O ye Spirit-souls, and men, and gods, and ye
dead, when ye see the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in the form of Horus, and
the favoured one of the Urrt Crown, fall ye down upon your faces. The word of
the Osiris Ani is truth before his enemies in heaven above, and on earth
beneath, and before the Tchatchau Chiefs of every god and of every goddess.
<P><I>This Chapter shall be recited over a large hawk standing upright with the
White Crown upon his head, [and over figures of] Tem, Shu, Tefnut, Keb, Nut,
Osiris, Isis, [Suti] and Nephthys. And they shall be painted in colour upon a
new tablet, which shall be placed in a boat, together with a figure of the
deceased. Anoint them with heken oil, and offer unto them burning incense, and
geese, and joints of meat roasted. It is an act of praise to Ra as he journeyeth
in his boat, and it will make a man to have his being with Ra, and to travel
with him wheresoever he goeth, and it will most certainly cause the enemies of
Ra to be slain. And the Chapter of travelling shall be recited on the sixth day
of the festival.</I>
