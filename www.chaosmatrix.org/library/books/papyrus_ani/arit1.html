<H3>THE SEVEN ARITS</H3><I>If [these] words be recited by the spirit when he
shall come to the Seven Arits, and as he entereth the doors, he shall neither be
turned back nor repulsed before Osiris, and he shall be made to have his being
among the blessed spirits, and to have dominion among the ancestral followers of
Osiris. If these things be done for any spirit he shall have his being in that
place like a lord of eternity in one body with Osiris, and at no place shall any
being contend against him.</I>
<H4>The First Arit.</H4>The name of the Doorkeeper is Sekhet-her-asht-aru. The
name of the Watcher is Smetti. The name of the Herald is Hakheru.
<P>The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, shall say when he cometh unto the First
Arit: "I am the mighty one who createth his own light. I have come unto thee, O
Osiris, and, purified from that which defileth thee, I adore thee. Lead on. Name
not the name of Ra-stau to me. Homage to thee, O Osiris, in thy might and in thy
strength in Ra-stau. Rise up and conquer, O Osiris, in Abtu. Thou goest round
about heaven, thou sailest in the presence of Ra, thou lookest upon all the
beings who have knowledge. Hail, Ra, thou who goest round about in the sky, I
say, O Osiris in truth, that I am the Sahu (Spirit-body) of the god, and I
beseech thee not to let me be driven away, nor to be cast upon the wall of
blazing fire. Let the way be opened in Ra-stau, let the pain of the Osiris be
relieved, embrace that which the Balance hath weighed, let a path be made for
the Osiris in the Great Valley, and let the Osiris have light to guide him on
his way."
<P>
