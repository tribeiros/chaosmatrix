<BODY>THE CHAPTER OF BREATHING THE AIR AND OF HAVING POWER OVER WATER IN
KHERT-NETER.
<H4></H4>The Osiris Ani saith:- Open to me! Who art thou? Whither goest thou?
What is thy name? I am one of you. Who are these with you? The two Merti
goddesses (Isis and Nephthys). Thou separatest head from head when [he] entereth
the divine Mesqen chamber. He causeth me to set out for the temple of the gods
Kem-heru. "Assembler of souls" is the name of my ferry-boat. "Those who make the
hair to bristle" is the name of the oars. "Sert" ("Goad") is the name of the
hold. "Steering straight in the middle" is the name of the rudder; likewise,
[the boat] is a type of my being borne onward in the lake. Let there be given
unto me vessels of milk, and cakes, and loaves of bread, and cups of drink, and
flesh, in the Temple of Anpu.
<P><I>RUBRIC: If the deceased knoweth this Chapter, he shall go into, after
coming forth from Khert-Neter of [the Beautiful Amentet].</I>
