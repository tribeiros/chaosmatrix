<P><I>[The following passage is taken from the Saite Recension]</I>
<P>
<H4>[THE CHAPTER OF GIVING A MOUTH TO THE OSIRIS, THE SCRIBE ANI, WHO
SAITH]:-</H4>Homage to thee, O thou lord of brightness, Governor of the Temple,
Prince of the night and of the thick darkness. I have come unto thee. I am
shining, I am pure. My hands are about thee, thou hast thy lot with thy
ancestors. Give thou unto me my mouth that I may speak with it. I guide my heart
at its season of flame and of night.
<P><I>If this Chapter be known by the Osiris the scribe Ani, upon earth, [or if
it be done] in writing upon [his] coffin, he shall come forth by day in every
form which he pleaseth, and he shall enter into [his] abode, and shall not be
repulsed. And cakes, and ale, and joints of meat [from those which are on] the
altar of Osiris shall be given unto him; and he shall enter in peace into
Sekhet-Aaru, conformably to the decree of the Dweller in Busiris. Wheat and
barley (dhura) shall be given unto him therein, and he shall flourish there just
as he did upon earth; and he shall do whatsoever it pleaseth him to do, even as
do the Company of the Gods who are in the Tuat, regularly and continually, for
millions of times.</I>
