<BODY>
<H4>THE CHAPTER OF OPENING THE MOUTH OF THE OSIRIS ANI.</H4>To be said:- The god
Ptah shall open my mouth, and the god of my town shall unfasten the swathings,
the swathings which are over my mouth. Thereupon shall come Thoth, who is
equipped with words of power in great abundance, and shall untie the fetters,
even the fetters of the god Set which are over my mouth. And the god Tem shall
cast them back at those who would fetter me with them, and cast them at him.
Then shall the god Shu open my mouth, and make an opening into my mouth with the
same iron implement wherewith he opened the mouth of the gods. I am the goddess
Sekhmet, and I take my seat upon the place by the side of Amt-ur the great wind
of heaven. I am the great Star-goddess Saah, who dwelleth among the Souls of
Anu. Now as concerning every spell, and every word which shall be spoken against
me, every god of the Divine Company shall set himself in opposition thereto.
