<H4>THE CHAPTER OF COMING FORTH BY DAY AFTER FORCING AN ENTRANCE THROUGH THE
AAMHET.</H4>The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, Soul, thou mighty one of terror!
Verily, I am here. I have come. I behold thee. I have passed through the Tuat. I
have seen Father Osiris. I have scattered the gloom of night. I am his beloved
one. I have come, I have seen my Father Osiris. I have stabbed the heart of
Suti. I have made offerings to my Father Osiris. I have opened every way in
heaven and on the earth. I am the son who loveth his Fathers (sic) Osiris. I am
a Spirit-body. I am a Spirit-soul. I am equipped. Hail, every god and every
Spirit-soul. I have made the way [to Osiris]. I the Osiris the scribe Ani, whose
word is truth.
