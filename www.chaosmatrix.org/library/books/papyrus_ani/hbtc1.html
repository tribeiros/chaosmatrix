<H4>HERE BEGIN THE CHAPTERS OF SEKHET-HETEPET, AND THE CHAPTERS OF COMING FORTH
BY DAY; OF GOING INTO AND OF COMING FORTH FROM KHERT-NETER; OF ARRIVAL IN
SEKHET-AARU; OF LIVING IN SEKHET-HETEPET, THE MIGHTY CITY, THE LADY OF WINDS; OF
HAVING POWER THEREIN; OF BECOMING A SPIRIT-SOUL THERE; OF PLOUGHING THERE; OF
REAPING THERE; OF EATING THERE; OF DRINKING THERE; OF MAKING LOVE THERE; AND OF
DOING EVERYTHING THERE EVEN AS A MAN DOETH UPON EARTH. NEBSENI, THE SCRIBE AND
DRAUGHTSMAN OF PTAH, SAITH:-</H4>Set vanguished Horus, who was looking at the
building in Sekhet-Hetepet. I set free Horus from Set. Set opened the paths of
the Two Eyes (the Sun and Moon) in the sky. Set ejected water with air upon the
soul of his Eye, which dwelt in the town of Mert; he delivered the interior of
the body of Horus from the hands of the Akeru Gods. Behold me! I paddle this
great boat over the Lake of the god Hetep; I seized upon it in the mansion of
Shu. The mansion of his stars reneweth youth, reneweth youth. I paddle over the
Lakes thereof so that I may arrive at the towns thereof. I sail up to the town
of the god Hetep.... Behold, I am at peace with his times, and with his
guidance, and with his will, and with the Company of the Gods, who are his
firstborn. He maketh the Two Fighters (Horus and Set) to be at peace [with each
other], and to keep ward over the living whom he hath created in fair form, and
he bringeth peace; he maketh the Two Fighters to be at peace with those who
watch over them. He cutteth off the hair from their divine fighters, he driveth
away storm from the children. He guardeth from attack the Spirits. I have gained
power therein. I know it. I have sailed over its Lakes so that I might arrive at
its towns. My mouth is strong. I am equipped against the Spirits. They shall not
gain the mastery over me. I am rewarded [with] these thy Fields, O god Hetep.
What thou wishest that do thou, O lord of the winds. I shall be a spirit
therein. I shall eat therein. I shall drink therein. I shall plough therein. I
shall reap the grain therein. I shall be strong therein. I shall make love
therein. My words shall be strong therein. I shall not be in subjection therein.
I shall be a man of might therein. Thou hast made strong the mouth and throat.
Hetep Qettbu is its name. [It is] stablished upon the pillars of Shu, and is
linked with the pleasant things of Ra. He is the divider of years, the hidden of
mouth; silent is his mouth, hidden is what he uttereth, he fulfilleth eternity,
he taketh possession of everlastingness of existence as Hetep, Neb-Hetep. Horus
maketh himself strong like unto a hawk which is one thousand cubits in length,
and two thousand cubits in life. He that equipments with him, he journeyeth on,
he cometh to the place where his heart would be, among the Lakes which are in
its towns. He begetteth in the birth-chamber of the god of the town, he is
satisfied with the food of the god of the town; he doeth what ought to be done
there, in the Field of Smas-er-Khet..... everything of the birth-chamber of the
god of the town. Now [when he] setteth in the [land of] life like crystal he
performeth everything therein, [which things are] like unto the things done in
the Lake Neserser, wherein there is none that rejoiceth, and wherein are evil
things of all kinds. The god Hetep goeth in and cometh out, and marcheth hither
and thither in the Field of Smas-er-Khet, the Lady of the birth-chamber of the
god of the town. [Let me] live with the god Hetep, clothed, and not despoiled by
the Lords of the North, and may the Lord of things bring food unto me. May he
make me to go forward. May I come forth. May he bring to me my Power there, may
I receive it, and may I be rewarded by the god Hetep. May I be master of the
great and mighty word in my body in this my place. Make me to remember it. Let
me [not] forget it. Let me go forward, let me plough. I am at peace with the god
of the town. I know the water, the towns, the nomes, and the lakes which are in
Sekhet-Hetepet. I live therein. I am strong therein. I shine therein. I eat
therein. I..... therein. I reap the harvest therein. I plough therein. I beget
children therein. I am at peace therein with the god Hetep. Behold I sow seed
therein. I sail about on the lakes thereof, and I arrive at its towns, O god
Hetep. Behold my mouth is equipped, it possesseth horns . Give unto me the
abundance of the KAU (Doubles) and Spirit-souls. He who counteth me is Shu. I
know him not. I come to its towns. I sail over its lakes. I walk about in
Sekhet-Hetepet. Behold, it is Ra who is in heaven. Behold, it is Hetep [who is]
its double offering of peace. I have advanced to its territory. I have put on my
apparel. I have come forth. I have given what it was upon me to give. I have
made glad in [my] heart. I have conquered. I am strong. I have given directions
to Hetep.
<P>[Hail], Unen-em-hetep, I have come to thee. My soul followeth me. The god Hu
is on my hands. [Hail], Nebt-taui, in whom I remember and forget, I have become
alive. I have attacked none, let none attack me. I have given, give thou to me
gladness. Make thou me to be at peace, bind thou up my veins, let [me] receive
air. [Hail], Unen-em-hetep, the Lord of Winds. I have come there. I have opened
my head. Ra sleepeth. I watch not, [for] the goddess Hetemet is at the door of
heaven by night. Obstacles have been put before, but I have collected his
emissions. I am in my city. O Nut-urt (Great City), I have come into thee. I
have counted up my abundant stores. I advance on my way to Uakh. I am the Bull
which is tied with a rope of lapis-lazuli, the lord of the Field of the Bull,
the lord of the words of the god, the goddess Septet (Sothis) at her hours. O
Uakh, I have come into thee. I have eaten my food. I am master of choice pieces
of the flesh of oxen and of feathered fowl, and the birds of Shu have been given
unto me. I follow the gods, and I come [after the Doubles]. O Tcheft, I have
come into thee. I array myself in apparel, and I gird about myself the sat
garment of Ra. Behold the Court of the sky, and the followers of Ra who dwell in
heaven. O Un-em-hetep, the lord of the Two Lands, I have come into thee. I have
plunged into the Lakes of Tchesert; behold, impurity of every kind hath removed
from me. The divine Great One flourisheth therein. Behold, I have found [him]. I
have netted geese, and have fed full upon the finest of them. O Qenqentet, I
have come into thee. I have seen the Osiris [my father]. I have saluted my
mother. I have begotten children. I have snared the serpents, and I am
delivered. I know the name of the god who is with the goddess Tchesert, and who
hath straight hair, and is equipped with horns [ready to gore]. He reapeth, and
I both plough and reap. O Hetemet, I have entered into thee. I have approached
the lapis-lazuli. I have followed the winds of the Company of the Gods. The
Great God hath given my head unto me. He who hath bound my head on my body for
me is the Mighty One, with eyes of lapis-lazuli, namely, Ari-en-ab-f ("He doeth
as he pleaseth"). O Usert, I have come into thee, to the house wherein food is
brought unto me. O Smam, I have come into thee. My heart watcheth, my head is
equipped with the White Crown. I act as the guide of the celestial beings. I
make to flourish terrestrial beings. There is joy of heart for the Bull, and for
the celestial beings, and for the Company of the Gods. I am the god, the Bull,
the Lord of the gods, who maketh his way over the turquoise. O wheat and barley
of the nome of the god, I have come into thee. I have come forward. I have
lifted [you] up, following the best offerings of the Company of the Gods. I have
moored my boat to the tying-up post in the lakes of the celestial beings. I have
pulled up the typing-up post. I have recited words, and I have ascribed praises
unto the gods who dwell in Sekhet-Hetepet.
