<H4>THE CHAPTER OF FORCING A WAY INTO AMENTET [AND OF COMING FORTH] BY
DAY.</H4>The Osiris Ani saith:- The town of Unu is opened. My head is sealed up,
Thoth. Perfect is the Eye of Horus. I have delivered the Eye of Horus which
shineth with splendours on the brow of Ra, the Father of the gods, [I am] that
self-same Osiris, [the dweller in] Amentet. Osiris knoweth his day, and he
knoweth that he shall live through his period of life; I shall have by being
with him. I am the Moon-god Aah, the dweller among the gods. I shall not come to
an end. Stand up therefore, O Horus, for thou art counted among the gods.
<P>
