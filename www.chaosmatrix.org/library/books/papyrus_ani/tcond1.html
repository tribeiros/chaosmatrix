<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT DYING A SECOND TIME.</H4>The Osiris Ani, whose word is
truth, saith:- Hail, Thoth! What is it that hath happened to the children of
Nut? They have waged war, they have upheld strife, they have done evil, they
have created the fiends, they have made slaughter, they have caused trouble; in
truth, in all their doings the strong have worked against the weak. Grant, O
might of Thoth, that that which the god Tem hath decreed [may be done!] And thou
regardest not evil, nor art thou provoked to anger when they bring their years
to confusion, and throng in and push in to disturb their months. For in all that
they have done unto thee they have worked iniquity in secret. I am they
writing-palette, O Thoth, and I have brought unto thee thine ink-jar. I am not
of those who work iniquity in their secret places; let not evil happen unto me.
<P>The Osiris, the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- Hail, Temu! What
manner of land is this unto which I have come? It hath not water, it hath not
air; it is depth unfathomable, it is black as the blackest night, and men wander
helplessly therein. In it a man cannot live in quietness of heart; nor may the
longings of love be satisfied therein. But let the state of the Spirit-souls be
given unto me instead of water and air, and the satisfying of the longings of
love, and let quietness of heart be given unto me instead of cakes and ale. The
god Tem hath decreed that I shall see thy face, and that I shall not suffer from
the things which pain thee. May every god transmit unto thee his throne for
millions of years. Thy throne hath descended unto thy son Horus, and the god Tem
hath decreed that thy course shall be among the holy princes. In truth he shall
rule from thy throne, and he shall be heir to the throne of the Dweller in the
fiery Lake [Neserser]. In truth it hath been decreed that in me he shall see his
likeness, and that my face shall look upon the face of the Lord Tem. How long
then have I to live? It is decreed that thou shalt live for millions of years, a
life of millions of years. Let it be granted to me to pass on to the holy
princes, for indeed, I have done away all the evil which I committed, from the
time when this earth came into being from Nu, when it sprang from the watery
abyss even as it was in the days of old. I am Fate and Osiris, I have made my
transformations into the likeness of divers serpents. Man knoweth not, and the
gods cannot behold the two-fold beauty which I have made for Osiris, the
greatest of the gods. I have given unto him the region of the dead. And, verily,
his son Horus is seated upon the throne of the Dweller in the fiery Lake [of
Neserser], as his heir. I have made him to have his throne in the Boat of
Millions of Years. Horus is stablished upon his throne [among his] kinsmen, and
he hath all that is with him. Verily, the Soul of Set, which is greater than all
the gods, hath departed. Let it be granted to me to bind his soul in fetter in
the Boat of the God, when I please, and let him hold the Body of the God in
fear. O my father Osiris, thou hast done for me that which thy father Ra did for
thee. Let me abide upon the earth permanently. Let me keep possession of my
throne. Let my heir be strong. Let my tomb, and my friends who are upon the
earth, flourish. Let my enemies be given over to destruction, and to the
shackles of the goddess Serq. I am thy son. Ra is my father. On me likewise thou
hast conferred life, strength, and health. Horus is established upon his tomb.
Grant thou that the days of my life may come unto worship and honour.
<P>
