<BODY>APPENDIX</A>
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Sutimes)</I>
<P>SUTIMES, THE LIBATIONER AND PRESIDENT OF THE ALTAR CHAMBER OF THE APTS,
DIRECTOR OF THE SCRIBES OF AMEN, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH, PRAISETH OSIRIS, AND DOETH
HOMAGE TO THE LORD OF ETERNITY, AND SATISFIETH THE WILL OF THE GOD, AND SPEAKETH
TRUTH, THE LORD OF WHICH IS UNKNOWN, AND SAITH:- Homage to thee, O thou Holy
God, thou mighty and beneficent being, thou Prince of Eternity, who dwellest in
thy abode in the Sektet Boat, whose risings are manifold in the Atet Boat, unto
whom praises are rendered in heaven and upon earth. Peoples and nations exalt
thee, and the awe of thy terror is in the hearts of men, and Spirt-souls, and
the dead. Thy soul dwelleth in Tetu, and the awe of thee is in Hensu. Thou
settest the visible emblems of thyself in Anu, and the majesty of thy
transformations in the holy place. I have come unto thee. Truth is in my heart,
and in my breast there is neither craft nor guile. Grant thou that I may have my
being among the living, and that I may sail up and down the river among those
who are in thy following.
<P>
