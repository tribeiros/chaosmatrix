<H2>TEXTS RELATING TO THE WEIGHING OF THE HEART OF ANI</H2>
<H4>THE SPEECH OF THOTH:-</H4>Thoth, the judge of right and truth of the Great
Company of the Gods who are in the presence of Osiris, saith: Hear ye this
judgment. The heart of Osiris hath in very truth been weighed, and his
Heart-soul hath borne testimony on his behalf; his heart hath been found right
by the trial in the Great Balance. There hath not been found any wickedness in
him; he hath not wasted the offerings which have been made in the temples; he
hath not committed any evil act; and he hath not set his mouth in motion with
words of evil whilst he was upon earth.
