<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF THE OSIRIS, THE ASSESSOR OF THE
DIVINE OFFERINGS OF ALL THE GODS, ANI, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH BEFORE OSIRIS, BE
DRIVEN BACK FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER.</H4>He saith:- My heart of my mother. My
heart of my mother. My heart-case of my transformations. Let not any one stand
up to bear testimony against me. Let no one drive me away from the Tchatcha
Chiefs. Let no one make thee to fall away from me in the presence of the Keeper
of the Balance. Thou art my KA, the dweller in my body, the god Khnemu who
makest sound my members. Mayest thou appear in the place of happiness whither we
go. Let not make my name to stink Shenit Chiefs, who make men to be stable. [Let
it be satisfactory unto us, and let the listening be satisfactory unto us, and
let there be joy of heart to us at the weighing of words. Let not lies be told
against me before the Great God, the Lord of Amentet. Verily, how great shalt
thou be when thou risest up in triumph!]
<P><I>These words are to be said over a scarab of green stone encircled with a
band of refined copper, and [having] a ring of silver; which shall be placed on
the neck of the Khu (the deceased), etc.</I>
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 21): If this Chapter be known [by the
deceased] he shall be declared a speaker of the truth both upon earth and in
Khert-Neter, and he shall be able to perform every act which a living human
being can perform. Now it is a great protection which hath been given by the
god. This Chapter was found in the city of Khemenu upon the slab of ba, which
was inlaid with [letters of] genuine lapis-lazuli, and was under the feet of
[the statue] of the god, during the reign of His Majesty, the King of the South
and North, Menkaura (Mycerinus), true of word, by Prince Herutataf, who found it
during a journey which he made to inspect the temples. One Nekht was with him
who was diligent in making him to understand it, and he brought it to the king
as a wonderful object when he perceived that it was a thing of great mystery,
[the like of] which had never [before] been seen or looked upon. This Chapter
shall be recited by a man who is ceremonially clean and pure, who hath not eaten
the flesh of animals, or fish, and who hath not had intercourse with women. And
behold, thou shalt make a scarab of green stone, with a rim [plated] with gold,
which shall be placed above the heart of a man, and it shall perform for him the
"opening of the mouth." And thou shalt anoint it with myrrh unguent, and thou
shalt recite over it the following words of magical power. [Here follows the
text of the Chapter of Not Letting the Heart of Ani Be Taken from Him.]</I>
