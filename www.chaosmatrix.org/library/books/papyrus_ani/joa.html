<H1>The Judges in Anu</H1>Hail, Thoth, who madest to be true the word of Osiris
against his enemies, make thou the word of the scribe Nebseni to be true against
his enemies, even as thou didst make the word of Osiris to be true against his
enemies, in the presence of the Tchatcha Chiefs who are with Ra and Osiris in
Anu, on the night of the "things of the night," and the night of battle, and of
the fettering of the Sebau fiends, and the day of the destruction of the enemies
of Neb-er-tcher.
<P>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs in Anu are Tem, Shu, Tefnut, [Osiris and
Thoth]. Now the "fettering of the Sebau fiends" signifieth the destruction of
the Smaiu fiends of Set, when he wrought iniquity a second time.
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against his
enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris Ani to be true against his enemies,
with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Tetu, on the night of setting up the
Tet in Tetu.
<P>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Tetu are Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and
Horus the avenger of his father. Now the "setting up of the Tet in Tetu"
signifieth [the raising up of] the shoulder of Horus, the Governor of Sekhem.
They are round about Osiris in the band [and] the bandages.
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against his
enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris Ani to be true against his enemies,
with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Sekhem, on the night of the "things of
the night" in Sekhem.
<P>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Sekhem are Heru-khenti-en-ariti and
Thoth who is with the Tchatcha Chiefs of Nerutef. Now the night of the "things
of the night festival" signifieth the dawn on the sarcophagus of Osiris.
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against his
enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris the scribe Ani to be true against his
enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in the double town Pe-Tep, on
the night of setting up the "Senti" of Horus, and of establishing him in the
inheritance of the possessions of his father Osiris.
<P>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Pe-Tep are Horus, Isis, Kesta
(Mesta) and Hapi. Now the "setting up of the 'Senti' of Horus" hath reference to
the words which Set spake to his followers, saying "Set up the Senti."
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against his
enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris the scribe Ani to be true, in peace,
against his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in the Lands of the
Rekhti (Taiu-Rekhti), in the night when Isis lay down, and kept watch to make
lamentation for her brother Osiris.
<P>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Taiu-Rekhti are Isis, Horus, Kesta
(Mesta) [Anpu and Thoth].
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris true against his enemies, make
thou the word of Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, in peace, to be
true against his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Abtu, on the
night of the god Haker, when the dead are separated, and the spirits are judged,
and when the procession taketh place in Teni.
<P>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Abtu are Osiris, Isis, and Up-uat.
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against his
enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris, the scribe and assessor of the sacred
offerings which are made to all the gods, Ani, to be true against his enemies,
with the Tchatcha Chiefs who examine the dead on the night of making the
inspection of those who are to be annihilated.
<P>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are present at the examination of the dead
are Thoth, Osiris, Anpu and Asten (read Astes). Now the inspection (or,
counting) of those who are to be annihilated signifieth the shutting up of
things from the souls of the sons of revolt.
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris true against his enemies, make
thou the word of the Osiris the scribe Ani to be true against his enemies, with
the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are present at the digging up of the earth [and
mixing it] with their blood, and of making the word of Osiris to be true against
his enemies.
<P>As concerning the Tchatcha Chiefs who are present at the digging up of the
earth in Tetu: When the Smaiu fiends of Set came [there], having transformed
themselves into animals, these Tchatcha Chiefs slew them in the presence of the
gods who were there, and they took their blood, and carried it to them. These
things were permitted at the examination [of the wicked] by those [gods] who
dwelt in Tetu.
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against his
enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris [the scribe] Ani to be true against
his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Nerutef on the night of
the "Hidden of Forms."
<P>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Nerutef are Ra, Osiris, Shu and
Bebi.
<P>Now, the night of the "Hidden of Forms" referreth to the placing on the
sarcophagus [of Osiris] the arm, the heel, and the thigh of Osiris Un-Nefer.
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris true against his enemies, make
thou the word of the Osiris, whose word is truth, to be true against his
enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Rasta, on the night when Anpu
lay with his arms on the things by Osiris, and when the word of Horus was make
to be true against his enemies.
<P>The great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Rasta are Horus, Osiris, and Isis. The
heart of Osiris is happy, the heart of Horus is glad, and the two halves of
Egypt (Aterti) are well satisfied thereat.
<P>Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris true against his enemies, make
thou the word of the Osiris the scribe Ani, the assessor of the holy offerings
made to all the gods, to be true against his enemies, with the Ten great
Tchatcha Chiefs who are with Ra, and with Osiris, and with every god, and with
every goddess, in the presence of the god Nebertcher. He hath destroyed his
enemies, and he hath destroyed every evil thing which appertained to him.
<P><I>If this Chapter be recited for, or over, the deceased, he shall come forth
by day, purified after death, according to the desire of his heart. Now if this
Chapter be recited over him, he shall progress over the earth, and he shall
escape from every fire, and none of the evil things which appertain to him shall
ever be round about him; never, a million times over, shall this be.</I>
