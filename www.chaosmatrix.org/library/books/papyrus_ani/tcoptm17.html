<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF NU, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH, BE DRIVEN
AWAY FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER.</H4>He saith:- My heart of my mother. My heart of
my mother. My heart-case of my existence upon the earth. Let no one stand up
against me when I bear testimony in the presence of the Lords of Things. Let it
not be said against me and of that which I have done "He hath committed acts
which are opposed to what is right and true," and let not charges be brought up
against me in the presence of the Great God, the Lord of Amentet. Homage to
thee, O my heart (ab). Homage to thee, O my heart-case. Homage to you, O my
reins. Homage to you, O ye gods, who are masters of [your] beards, and who are
holy by reason of your sceptres. Speak ye for me words of good import to Ra, and
make ye me to have favour in the sight of Nehebkau.
<P>
