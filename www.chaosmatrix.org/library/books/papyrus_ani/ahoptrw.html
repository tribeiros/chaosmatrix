<H3 align=center>A HYMN OF PRAISE TO RA WHEN HE RISETH IN THE EASTERN PART OF
HEAVEN.</H3>Those who are in his following rejoice, and the Osiris, the scribe
Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- Hail, thou Disk, thou lord of rays, who risest
on the horizon day by day. Shine thou with thy beams of light upon the face of
the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, for he singeth hymns of praise to thee at
dawn, and he maketh thee to sit at eventide [with words of adoration]. May the
soul of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, come forth with thee into heaven!
May he set out with thee in the Matet Boat [in the morning], may he come into
port in the Sektet Boat [in the evening], and may he cleave his path among the
stars of heaven which never rest.
<P>The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, being at peace [with his god], maketh
adoration to his Lord, the Lord of Eternity, and saith:- Homage to thee, O
Heru-khuti, who art the god Khepera, the self-created. When thou risest on the
horizon and sheddest thy beams of light upon the Lands of the South and of the
North, thou art beautiful, yea beautiful, and all the gods rejoice when they
behold thee, the king of heaven. The goddess, the Lady of the Hour, is
stablished upon thy head, her Uraei of the South and of the North are upon thy
brow, and she taketh up her place before thee. The god Thoth is stablished in
the bows of thy boat to destroy utterly all thy foes. Those who dwell in the
Tuat come forth to meet thee, and they bow to the earth in homage as they come
towards thee, to look upon thy beautiful Form. And I, Ani, have come into thy
presence, so that I may be with thee, and may behold thy Disk every day. Let me
not be kept captive [by the tomb], and let me not be turned back [on my way].
Let the members of my body be made new again when I contemplate thy beauties,
even as are the members of all thy favoured ones, because I am one of those who
worshipped thee upon earth. Let me arrive in the Land of Eternity, let me enter
into the Land of Everlastingness. This, O my Lord, behold thou shalt ordain for
me.
<P>AND MOREOVER, THE OSIRIS ANI, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH, IN PEACE, THE
TRUTH-SPEAKER, SAITH:- Homage to thee, O thou who risest on thy horizon in the
form of Ra, who restest upon Law, [which can neither be changed nor altered].
Thou passest over the sky, and every face, watcheth thee and thy course, for
thou thyself art hidden from their gaze. Thou dost show thyself [to them] at
dawn and at eventide each day. The Sektet Boat, wherein Thy Majesty dwelleth,
setteth forth on its journey with vigour. Thy beams [fall] upon all faces, thy
light with its manifold colours is incomprehensible [to man], and thy brilliant
rays cannot be reported. The Lands of the Gods see thee, they could write
[concerning thee]; the Deserts of Punt could count thee. Thy creation is hidden.
It is one by the opening of thy mouth. Thy form is the head of Nu. May he (Ani)
advance, even as thou dost advance, without cessation, even as Thy Majesty
[ceaseth not to advance] even for a moment. With great strides thou dost in one
little moment pass over limitless distances which would need millions and
hundreds of thousands of years [for a man to pass over; this] thou doest, and
then thou sinkest to rest. Thou bringest to an end the hours of the night, even
as thou stridest over them. Thou bringest them to an end by thine own ordinance,
and dawn cometh on the earth. Thou settest thyself before thy handiwork in the
form of Ra, and thou rollest up on the horizon....... Thou sendest forth light
when thy form raiseth itself up, thou ordainest the increase of thy splendours.
Thou mouldest thy limbs as thou advancest, thou bringest them forth, thou who
wast never brought forth, in the form of Ra, who rolleth up into the height of
heaven. Grant thou that I may reach the heaven of eternity, and the region where
thy favoured ones dwell. May I unite with those holy and perfect Spirit-souls of
Khert-Neter. May I come forth with them to behold thy beauties as thou rollest
on at eventide, as thou journeyest to thy mother Nut (the Night-sky), and dost
place thyself at the right hand (in the West). My two hands are raised to thee
in praise and thanksgiving when thou settest in life. Behold, thou art the
Creator of Eternity, who art adored when thou settest in Nu. I have set thee in
my heart, without wavering, O thou who art more divine than the gods.
<P>The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- Praise and thanksgiving be unto
thee, O thou who rollest on like unto gold, thou Illuminer of the Two Lands on
the day of thy birth. Thy mother brought thee forth on her hand, and thou didst
light up with splendour the circle which is travelled over by the Disk. O Great
Light who rollest across Nu, thou dost raise up the generations of men from the
deep source of thy waters, and dost make to keep festivals all districts and
cities, and all habitations. Thou protectest [them] with thy beauties. Thy KA
riseth up with the celestial food hu and tchefau. O thou mightily victorious
one, thou Power of Powers, who makest strong thy throne against the sinful ones,
whose risings on thy throne in the Sektet Boat are mighty, whose strength is
widespread in the Atett Boat, make thou the Osiris Ani to be glorious by virtue
of his word, which is truth, in Khert-Neter. Grant thou that he may be in
Amentet free from evil, and let [his] offences be [set] behind thee. Grant thou
that he may [live there] a devoted slave of the Spirit-souls. Let him mingle
among the Heart-souls who live in Ta-tchesert (the Holy Land). Let him travel
about in the Sekhet-Aaru (the Elysian Fields), conformably to [thy] decree with
joy of heart- him the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth.
<P>[And the god maketh answer]:--Thou shalt come forth into heaven, thou shalt
sail over the sky, and thou shalt hold loving intercourse with the Star-gods.
Praises shall be made to thee in the Boat. Thy name shall be proclaimed in the
Atett Boat. Thou shalt look upon Ra within his shrine. Thou shalt make the Disk
to set [with prayer] every day. Thou shalt see the Ant Fish in his
transformations in the depths of the waters of turquoise. Thou shalt see the
Abtu Fish in his time. It shall be that the Evil One shall fall when he deviseth
a plan to destroy thee, and the joints of his neck and back shall be hacked
asunder. Ra saileth with a fair wind, and the Sektet Boat progresseth and cometh
into port. The mariners of Ra rejoice, and the heart of the Lady of the Hour is
glad, for the enemy of her Lord hath been cast to the ground. Thou shalt behold
Horus standing on the pilot's place in the Boat, and Thoth and Maat shall stand
one on each side of him. All the gods shall rejoice when they behold Ra coming
in peace to make the hearts of the Spirit-souls to live, and the Osiris Ani,
whose word is truth, the assessor of the holy offerings of the Lords of Thebes,
shall be with them!
