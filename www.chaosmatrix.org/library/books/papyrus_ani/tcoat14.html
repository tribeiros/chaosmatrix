<H4>[THE CHAPTER OF] MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO A HERON.</H4>The Osiris the
scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I am the master of beasts brought for
sacrifice, [and] of the knives which are [held] at their heads [and] their
beards; those who dwell in their emerald [fields], the Aged Gods, and the
Spirit-souls, are ready at the moment for the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth,
in peace. He maketh slaughter on the earth, and I make slaughter on the earth. I
am strong. I follow the heights unto heaven. I have made myself pure. I walk
with long strides to my city. I have become an owner of land there. I advance to
Sepu...... is given to me in Unu. I have set the gods upon their roads. I have
made splendid the houses and towns of those who are in their shrines. I know the
stream of Nut. I know Tatun. I know Teshert. I have brought along their horns. I
know Heka. I have hearkened to this words. I am the Red Bull-calf which is
marked with markings. The gods shall say when they hear [of me]: Uncover your
faces. His coming is to me. There is light which ye know not. Times and seasons
are in my body. I do not speak [lies] in the place of truth, daily. The truth is
hidden on the eyebrows. [By] night [I] sail up the river to keep the feast of
him that is dead, to embrace the Aged God, and to guard the earth, I the Osiris
Ani, whose word is truth.
