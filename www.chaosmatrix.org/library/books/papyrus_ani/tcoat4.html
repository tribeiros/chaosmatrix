<H4>[THE CHAPTER] OF MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO A HAWK OF GOLD.</H4>The
Osiris Ani saith:- I have risen up out of the seshett chamber, like the golden
hawk which cometh forth from his egg. I fly, I alight like a hawk with a back of
seven cubits, and the wings of which are like unto the mother-of-emerald of the
South. I have come forth from the Sektet Boat, and my heart hath been brought
unto me from the mountain of the East. I have alighted on the Atet Boat, and
there have been brought unto me those who dwelt in their substance, and they
bowed in homage before me. I have risen, I have gathered myself together like a
beautiful golden hawk, with the head of the Benu, and Ra hath entered in [to
hear my speech]. I have taken my seat among the great gods, [the children of]
Nut. I have settled myself, the Sekhet-hetepet (the Field of Offerings) is
before me. I eat therein, I become a Spirit-soul therein, I am supplied with
food in abundance therein, as much as I desire. The Grain-god (Nepra) hath given
unto me food for my throat, and I am master over myself and over the attributes
of my head.
