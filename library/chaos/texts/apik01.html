<HR>
Common to the various systems/traditions/paradigms of Magick are
certain key concepts. We urge the reader not to accept/reject
these as theoretical constructs, but to try and verify them by
personal experience.<BR>

<OL>
<LI>The Whole is encoded within each of its constituents - "As
above, so below."
<LI>The Whole is interconnected, and all relative wholes partake
in consciousness to varying degrees.
<LI>The Whole is self-organizing, and the evolution of all forms
is governed by similar principles.
<LI>By means of a trained and directed will, we can effect change
(probability &gt; possibility) at various levels of organization.
<LI>Change is the only constant!
<LI>The Whole is more than the sum of its parts
<LI>Our beliefs define the limits of our allowed experience
<LI>"Everyday Reality" is not the limit of our experience
- by entering Altered States of Consciousness we can experience
other realities.
<LI>The entities which may be encountered during our experience
of those other realities are <I>real within their own world</I>.
To question their relative existence is unimportant, since the
universe behaves as if they <I>do</I> exist.
<LI>Magical ability is engendered through an inward, transformative
journey.
