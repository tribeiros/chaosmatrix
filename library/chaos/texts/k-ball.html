The sidrat asked, (certainly feeding us a straight line...)<BR>
<BLCOKQUOTE>
        > Martin, what is a k-ball?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

And Fr.L.D.  Funquiebutt, unable to contain his Self, responds:<P>

A K-ball is sort of like a cue ball (used in billiards and pool). It is a
dense, heavy sphere, usually white in color. However, the "K-ball" is made
mostly of a material resembling Matzo, which has been compressed almost to
a singularity density. K-balls have many uses, the most common of which is
when it is used very much like a cue ball, in a game played only on the
Astral plane, known as "Pocket Pool (pull)", where the K-ball is used to
careen around the spheroid "ego-balls" of up-and-coming mages on a table
that bears a remarkable resemblence to a CAT-scan of Elvis's colon...<P>

And (not unlike revenge) K-balls are best when served cool...<P>

For the humor-impaired, the "K-ball" is a tongue-in-cheek way that many
Chaotes (and most Discordians) refer to the Cabala...<P>
