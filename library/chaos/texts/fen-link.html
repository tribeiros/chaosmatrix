Corporations are a funny thing.  Legally, they are an entity in their own
right that can hold possessions, be sued, enter into contracts, etc., but
there's no real human being that you can point to as responsible for the
corporation.  The CEO and BOD are really just the brains of the operation,
directing their lumbering beast through corporate legalities and fiscal
quarters.  Thus when attacking a corporation, it is very easy to target
the corporation itself---it's essentially a large egregore with a lot of
belief invested in it by its workers and its consumers.  So treat an
attack on a corporation as you would an attack on a very large demon,
egregore, or demigod.<BR><BR>

Let's examine how such an attack might work:<BR><BR>

The easy thing about this is that corporations have sigils: their
corporate logo.  And these sigils are intrinsically linked to the
corporation, they want it thus.  They want the mere sight of their logo to
remind their consumers of their product and their product alone.  There is
a very significant magickal link between that image and the corporation
itself.  Thus, if you need an image of the corporation, their logo makes a
wonderful magickal link, just as the sigil of a goetic demon allows you a
link by which to manipulate it.<BR><BR>

One of the best ways to actually get their logo is to either buy a product
of theirs and cut it out of the cardboard box, or to send them snailmail
as an interested consumer asking for informational material about their
products, and using the logo from their flyers, letterhead, etc.<BR><BR>

I also find that converting the wording of any ritual I am using into
legalese works quite well to put my mind in the proper state from which to
attack a corporation.<BR><BR>

My own chaotic take on a simple binding (during which I would be charging
a sigil to bind the corporation while burning the corporate logo, or
wrapping the logo with cord, or some other symbolic act):<BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   "By the power of igneous plasma (heretofore known as FIRE), the power
   of H20 (heretofore known as WATER), the power of atmospheric
   composition (heretofore known as AIR), and the power of solid matter
   (heretofore known as EARTH) [magickal name here], forthwith known as
   "THE MAGUS" does hereby constrict actions via magickal means ("bind")
   this legally created entity, forthwith known as "ABC CORPORATION", from
   causing harm (defined as emotional, mental, physical, or fiscal
   distress) to anyone and everyone (i.e. "the general public") for the
   duration of this contract, which is to be no less than the life of the
   corporation, and no more than the duration of an eternity, whichever is
   longer."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

You get the idea---I'm sure with fifteen minutes to spare I could
embellish it to the proper pitch and legal fervor necessary for the proper
gnosis.  If you need examples of legalese that Beelzebub's minions down in
the "infernal contracts" department have been taking examples from, just
read all that 6 point print on your latest copy of a software product from
Microsoft.  &gt;;-&gt;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<XMP>>  And would a piece of the building matter anyway?</XMP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Probably not.  We're chaos magicians; we use whatever works.  If you can't
get a piece of the building, it's obviously not going to work!  Besides,
coporate logos already have a strong link.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<XMP>> For that matter, just What constitutes a magical link?</XMP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

A magickal link is anything you can use to create a connection in your
mind between yourself and the target.  The thing that evokes the strongest
reaction in you is the best magickal link for you (though not necessarily
for someone else).  Since everything in the universe is connected anyway,
just the knowledge that this person has affected you in a severe enough
manner to piss you off can be a significant enough magickal link to attack
them (this is the method most true gen-trad witches I've met use).<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<XMP>> I have a picture of the CEO.</XMP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If that's the strongest link for <I>you</I>, then use it.  But remember,
Corporations gain and lose CEOs.  Would the corporation be any better with
a different man at the helm?  Very rarely is this the case.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<XMP>> maybe I could send a letter that Might be read.  At least it would end

</BLOCKQUOTE>

I've used such reverse links rather effectively.  This also shows up in
other magickal lore assending a sigil to your target (or leaving a bloody
heart with iron nails through it on their doorstep, sending them a veve,
calling them and chanting a mantra until they hang up, etc.).
Incidentally, it's probably the weird sense of terror or the bizarre that
halps magnify the magickal effect (or, in some cases, is altogether
responsible for it.)  My best luck in this approach has been to send
something so completely bizarre that it attracts massive amounts of
attention without being threatening ("hey guys, come look at this---what
*is* it?").  Oftentimes, if you can make it rpetty or artistic enough, it
ends up getting its own prominent desplay place as a conversation piece.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Can't hurt.  I'd use this in concert with other techniques; perhaps
setting up the same sigil you create for any rituals you do.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

There is no such thing as a weak or powerful information link.  That's the
great thing about them.  Information is information, and it can be copied,
moved, altered, etc.  No "strength", but plenty of "skill" required.
Finesse over force; the same key to mastering any martial art.<BR>

This is a self-imposed restriction.<BR><BR>

Good luck.<BR>
