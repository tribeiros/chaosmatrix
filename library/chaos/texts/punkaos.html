I'll take a swing at that...<P>Hine is correct, to a point. In one sense, Chaos
Magic has suffered the same fate as "witchcraft" and "satanism" has in the last
few years: the arrival of the "bumpkins" from the suburbs (present company
excluded, ofcourse) much to the chagrin of the "old hands" who have been at it
for awhile.<P>

Here's an analogy I like: Back when I was in the nascent punk-rock scene (like
around 1976-78) it was a cutting-edge underground genre completely shunned by
the mainstream -- in fact, it was UNKNOWN by the mainstream. And punk had a lot
of similarities to chaos magic; it could be said it was the "chaos magic" of
rock music. It was visceral, dark and forbidding; it dealt with people and
concepts on the edge of modern culture; it deconstructed the paradigm of rock
music and in the process found itself closer to the genre's actual roots; it
was persued by rugged, individualistic do-it-yourself-ers; it held the
"mainstream" in clear contempt; it allowed for a incredible range of personal
expression, from the Sex Pistols to Devo. And it was INEVITABLE, given the
state of the"art" and the cultural milleau of the times.<P>

Then our postmodern culture began to assimilate what seemed to be
un-assimilatable. Punk rock became "chic" and the culture vultures arrived to
feast on its body. The "kids from the suburbs"  started showing up at the shows
that used to be the exclusive playground of the "real punks". Safety-pinned
clothes on the rack at Macy's.  Calvin Klein heroin-chic magazine ads. Spikey
hairdos at Vidal Sassoon's.  PUNK ROCK HALLMARK GREETING CARDS!<P>

All this, of course, has the effect of driving the originators of the"genre" out
of the loop, and led to the expected announcements that the"movement is dead"
and so forth. The rise and "fall" of Chaos Magic has followed a similar pattern.
At first it was undefinable. Me and my fellow punk rockers used to ride the
buses in San Francisco back around 1977 withour black leather, safety pins and
purple hair, and people looked at uslike we were from another planet. They didn't
call us "punks" because they didn't know WHAT to call us. If anyone tried to ask
us to "explain" whatwe were doing we would laugh -- either you just "got it" or
you would NEVER get it. We were utterly alien to their cultural paradigm --
true antinomianism. Then people came along who felt it had to be qualified and
quantified. Books were published "explaining" punk to non-punks. We saw "punk
politics" and "punk philosophy" arise. Major record companies signed the most
popular bands and they were assimlated into the mainstream. The clubs were overrun
by posers and "weekend punks".<P>

Now it's happened to Chaos Magic. Even sheer iconclasts like we AXions have a
working group that meets at an OTO LODGE fercrissake! (Talk aboutgetting signed to
a major label...) Ten years ago the OTO considered usthe most disgusting of
heretics, now we're teaching THEM how to rediscover what they lost long ago.
We've now entered the "post-punk" period of Chaos Magic, with youngsters like
yourself representing the Nirvanas and Pearl Jams of the latter times.<P>

So in that sense, "chaos is dead" -- but it's not, not really. We will never
recapture the halcyon days of yore, but that does not invalidate itas a culture.
As long as anyone can pick up a guitar (wand), put together a band (working group),
write their own songs (rituals), make music (magic) their own way and not give a
fuck if anyone else thinks it's "valid", the spirit that was punk (chaos) will
never die.<P>

I've said it before, and I'll say it agin: it's the ATTITUDE thatmatters.<P>
