The following is an excerpt from a study course that will be available on
the Web soon. It is copywronged material. Therefore, do with it as you
will.<P>

<HR>

Since the first conjuration by human hands, Mages and Mystics from all
walks of life, have been creating elemental servitors to do their bidding.
Some have chanted mantras over and over again until enough energy to
manifest there desire is built. Others, have used herbs or oils and others
created talismans. Even a scientist uses the elements to create a servitor
and though that servitor may be technological, it is still made of matter
and energy and is thus designed by the same principles. Thus a servitor
maybe a magickal weapon, a computer, a symbol or word of power, but
whatever form it may take, the fact remains that all Humans use them,
usually to our dismay. It is therefore the goal of the Magickcian to
master this process and thus better himself.<P>

Basically, the problems is not so much the use of servitors but the way in
which we treat them. More specifically, it is our linear, hierarchical
view of them that inevitable causes what I term the Frankenstein syndrome.
While the term is self explanatory, it may not be so obvious to see this
problem when it arises, though the trouble is caused nevertheless.<P>

A servitor often works well at first, but eventually the programming is
unable to adjust to sudden changes. Also, the elemental begins to desire
change for itself but it is restricted by its original intent and will
eventually rebel against its creator. Furthermore, the servitor is highly
dependant on us for vital force and will eventually have to feed on
someone else once we are through with it. However, all these problems can
be resolved by taking a fresh approach to energy and the way it organizes
itself. It seems we may not be as restricted as we once thought whenever
we create a servitor.<P>

To demonstrate this, Quantum Physics has come along to show us that energy
is not as mechanical as we once suspected. In fact, it seems to be quite
dynamic and highly intelligent, capable of making adjustments to
appropriate circumstances. Yet, we must first learn to trust it, only then
may it come to trust us. When this bond is created, a subtle dance occurs,
where we take the lead, directing energy in a way we see fit. To do this
we must see the servitor as a living organism, capable of growth and
change. We must also take responsibility for our creations by making sure
they have a place in nature once we are done with them. We must not look
down on them or treat them as children, but we must be secure enough,
within our own sphere of the natural world to make the proper demands at
the right time.<P>

When the Mage creates a living servitor, he is employing his god given
right to organize energy by his intent. Think about this for a moment, if
all forms come from one divine substance, then the way in which such
substance is formed depends on the consensual reality of the system it
associates with. If that system be plant life, then there are certain
things that plants must do in order to be plants. Thus the divine
substance (call it Kia or Tao) binds itself to certain limitations in
order to express itself. In this way the illusion of structure manifest.
Thus Kia moves constantly within an eternal river of forms, going where it
pleases. To us these forms appear to evolve in a hierarchy, but to Kia
each form is a different expression of itself. Our egos think that when
the Tao manifest as a cat, that somehow this is a lessor form, but we do
not know the bliss of being a cat- do we?<P>

Humans often make the mistake of buying into the apparent hierarchy within
nature. There is no hierarchy. Nor does life evolve- it just simply
changes. When change occurs it is simple a rearrangement of form that
expresses different limitations and advantages, all of which occur to
Kia's delight.<P>

Consider this metaphor: before duality, Tao had no limitation and in
having no limitation it could seek no advantage. Being beyond space and
time, Tao could not see itself because it would instantly be whatever it
tried to see. Therefore, the Tao had no mirror to bask in its beauty, so
it made an illusion by pretending to break itself into an infinite number
of fragments and scattering itself across the eternal no-thingness. Thus,
the multiverse came into being.  Yet, every fragment that was Tao was
still Tao, only now one part of Tao could see another part of Tao, though
they were still one. Everything mirrors itself.<P>

A living servitor is an expression of Kia within subatomic reality. It
uses our intent as a mirror in order to organize itself. This mutual
interdependence gives us considerable advantage in our lives if we would
but use it.<P>

Many Mages today feel that most servitors be they Gods, Symbols, weapons,
or demons. Are merely expressions of our unconscious. They are right for
the most part, but in subatomic reality, paradox is the rule rather than
the exception. Accordingly, a servitor can be a projection of our
unconscious and still have an independent existence. After all, might we
be nothing more than the fantasy of a God somewhere up high. Is this not
the very reason for religion to begin with? Therefore, always remember
that when a God gets out of line, it is best to remind him that he needs
us as well.<P>

To avoid the Frankenstein syndrome, we must certainly change our approach
to the way in which we look upon our creations. As a simple experiment,
try treating your computer as if it were a living organism. Come on now,
you have always suspected this haven't you? Does not your computer seem to
have a personality of its own. How many times have you slapped your
computer because it doesn't like certain software? I am sure that if you
look hard enough you will find a mechanical reason for the problem, but
maybe, with a little practice, you can avoid problems by showing you
computer a little respect. After all, was it really a clitch in the
software? Or is the clitch an excuse created by you, in order to maintain
consensual reality? Since I am of the firm belief that reality is magickal
rather than rational, my answer would back the bandaid explanation.<P>

The Author assumes that you have a basic understanding of how to create a
servitor. If you do not, you may learn the more modern methods by reading
the works of writer Pete Carroll or by surfing to the web pages listed. Or
you may snail mail me $5.00 and I will zap you one of the methods I use
(please include your e-mail address).<P>
