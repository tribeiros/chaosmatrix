<H1>Counting Coup:<BR>
Magical Combat for Fun and Training</H1>

<H3>by Phil Hine</H3>

<HR>

The growth of Chaos Magic has seen a rise of interest in active
research into Magical Combat techniques and theory. However, I
am not proposing that people take out their frustrations on each
other (for slights imagined and otherwise) to a deadly extent,
but to propose that Magical Combat can be used as a training exercise
which can be FUN at the same time.<P>

True instances of Magical Combat are rare indeed. In fifteen years
of active magical practice I have only been attacked by other
magicians three times - and in each instance, was able to do something
about it. I daresay there have been more attempts, but seeing
as I haven't noticed them, they've either been extremely subtle
or, as is more likely, have failed utterly.<P>

To be effective in Magical Combat situations, you need to have
developed the following skills:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>A fair degree of Psychic sensitivity - you have to be aware
that an attack is being made on you before you can do something
about it.
<LI>A good understanding of your own Self, its demons, paranoias,
and defences.
<LI>An ability to quickly assess a situation and make the most
effective response.
<LI>A good knowledge (and skill) in a variety of Combat techniques
-- both defensive and offensive.
<LI>A sense of perspective in how you deal with the situation.
<LI>A sense of humour!
</OL>
<P>

All these skills are useful in other areas, and what I am proposing
here is that a structured Combat System can test out these skills
in a 'live' situation.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Counting Coup</H3>

I don't think it would be constructive for people to go around
'zapping' each other indiscriminately. Hence the American Indian
concept of 'Counting Coup' where the sense of honour came through
penetrating an enemies defences, and merely 'touching' them with
a lance.<P>

Doing this as a Magical Exercise necessitates that a minimum of
three individuals be made aware of the situation: the two opponents
and a moderator. The test can take place between members of a
group, or individuals across time &amp; space. Co-operation and
strict honesty on all parts must be stressed.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Sample Guidelines</H3>

Soror Wibble and Frater Bater agree to challenge each other and
request that Soror Fanny-Batter act as Moderator. Soror F. decides
that the time-span for the Combat will be six weeks -- so the two
opponents can attempt to Count Coup on each other within that
period only -- too short a period means that the opponents will
most likely spend too much time 'actively' concentrating on their
defence strategies -- making the period several weeks means that
either of them is more likely to be caught 'off-guard' -- which
is the whole point; testing awareness and responses. Each participant
will individually discuss with Soror F. which Combat 'forms' they
are likely to attempt, and to contact her immediately that they
perceive that they have been succesfully 'attacked'. Soror F.,
once the combat period is over, can then assess each individuals'
performance and award brownie points.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Example Combat Forms</H3>

<B>Dreamstalking</B><P>

Involves appearing in opponents' dream-world and executing a specific
action or message (as given to moderator) - such as blowing a
rasberry, 'mooning' or delivering a ribald message.<P>

<B>Pop-up Servitors</B><P>

Involves sneaking a specifically-programmed Servitor in past opponents'
local defences, and having it execute some 'harmless' task such
as waking them up in the middle of the night several times consecutively.
<P>

<B>"Blank" Thunderbolts</B><P>

Involves hurling bolts of magical energy at opponent, which, though
not destructive, do effect them - bolts of sudden inspiration,
for example.<P>

<B>Passing the P-Runes</B><P>

Involves passing opponent a physical object which is charged (for
example, using a sigil) so as to affect them in a given way. Hidden
'watermarks' in paper or underneath picture files are another
way to do this.<P>

<B>Invoking from a Distance</B><P>

Involves invoking an entity upon opponent from a distance -- to
cause a change in behaviour.<P>

<B>Micellaneous</B><P>

Any other combat Forms which the opponents, in consultation with
the moderator, may devise.<P>

<B>Information-Gathering</B><P>

Within the Combat, it is permissible for opponents to resort to
information-gathering strategies to check on each other, such
as scrying, tarot, runes, or oracles.<P>

<B>Bystanders</B><P>

It is NOT permissible to 'attack' opponents by going via other
people around them, except in those instances when entire groups
of magicians are entering the period of Combat.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Ending</H3><P>

Once the Combat moderator has declared the Combat period elapsed
or declared in favour of one participant, then opponents must
cease all related activities. It might be beneficial for the moderator
to bring both participants together for a formal 'closing' rite,
followed by divers revels and merriment. The 'winner' may be awarded
some cheap token of 'marksmanship' followed by the moderator setting
them some small task to perform for the 'loser' (like washing
socks, for example). Thus balance is maintained.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>It goes without saying that the successful execution of Combat
strategies itself is a useful test of skill and technique.
<LI>I have deliberately not given detailed instructions on Magical
Combat Forms &amp; Defensive Strategies. Competent magicians who
desire to attempt this exercise should use their own ingenium
in working out strategies.
