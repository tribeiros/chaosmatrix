<I>&quot;My skull is a drum; each great beat drives that leg,
like the point of a stake, into the ground. The singing is at
my very ear, inside my head. This sound will drown me! ... I cannot
wrench the leg free. I am caught in this cylinder, this well of
sound. There is nothing anywhere except this. The white darkness
moves up the veins of my leg like a swift tide rising, rising;
it is a great force which I cannot sustain or contain, which will
surely burst my skin. &quot;Mercy&quot; I scream within me. I
hear it echoed by the voices, shrill and unearthly: &quot;Erzulie!&quot;
The bright darkness floods up through my body, reaches my head,
engulfs me. I am sucked down and exploded at once. That is all.&quot;</I>

<FONT SIZE=5>T</FONT>he phenomena known as Possession has been,
until fairly recently, a comparatively rare phenomena in Western
Magical practice. This is possibility due to it's association,
in the nineteenth century, with some of the more grosser elements
of Mediumship, and a general misunderstanding of non-western magical
approaches such as Voudoun and Santeria, which have, until the
recent popularisation of anything possibly &quot;ethnic/shamanistic&quot;,
been denigrated as &quot;primitive&quot; religions - particularly
by descendants of the Theosophists who, as Michael Bertiaux put
it in a recent interview  &quot;are obsessed with their childhood
experiences of voudon, based on 1930's and 1940's zombie movies.&quot;
<P>
It is also the case that experience of possession is difficult
for many people, particularly those conditioned by a European
upbringing, since possession requires disinhibition and the ability
to surrender oneself to passion - something which, on the whole,
is neither socially sanctioned or consistent with the self-image
of &quot;being in control&quot;.
<P>
Over the last few years however, there has been a marked rise
in the practice of possession-oriented ritual, where the aim of
the working is for the appearance of an entity into a human vessel,
for purposes of enchantment, illumination, or oracular utterances.
The use of possession-based work is particularly strong within
Wicca, the Northern Tradition, and the freestyle approach generally
termed as Chaos Magick. Having had many opportunities to participate
in such workings (both as a vessel and a celebrant), I hereby
offer an analysis of the possession experience for discussion.
<P>
Possession is a wide-ranging phenomena which is probably the most
popular form of union with the divine in human history. Possession-oriented
rituals are apparent in ancient Egypt and it has been shown that
the earliest forms of Cabbalistic practice were oriented towards
this type of experience. Possession was a recognised phenomena
in ancient Greece, two examples being the Delphic oracle, and
the practices of the Theurgists, defined by Proclus as &quot;...
in a word, all the operations of divine possession.&quot; Possession
is a central feature of Voudoun, Santeria, and Macumba, religions
which are gaining increasing popularity, and is apparent in most
tribal cultures, from America to Australasia.
<P>
Possession also appears in early Christianity - particularly with
the manifestation of &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; which remains
popular in modern-day forms of evangelical Christianity. St. Paul's
dramatic experience on the road to Damascus bears all the hallmarks
of a sudden divine possession, yet he was worried by the phenomenon,
and found it necessary to lecture the Corinthian Christians on
the need to carefully manage speaking in tongues.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I> &quot;If therefore, the whole church assembles, and all speak
in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not
say that you are mad? ...do not forbid speaking in tongues, but
all things should be done decently and in order&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
(I Corinthians, 14).
<P>
In general, there are two routes into the ecstasy of possession.
The first is solitary, and the second is group-oriented. Solitary
possession is often the result of an extended retirement of meditation,
prayer, or ritual, whereby the celebrant attains union with the
chosen entity. The basics of this procedure was eloquently described
by Steve Wilson in his article  Results Mysticism  in C.I 15.
This was the path of solitary mystics such as St. John of the
Cross. Within the context of monotheism, this practice is not
without its dangers. The Sufi mystic al-Hallaj announced that
he was &quot;God&quot;, and later, was crucified. The Christian
mystics of the Middle Ages were often, one step away from being
viewed as heretics. In India, this form of solitary possession
is known as Bhakti Yoga.
<P>
The key elements of this experience are easy to identify. Firstly,
there is a degree of isolation from other people. Isolation, in
varying degrees, contributes greatly to the loss of a sense of
ego-boundaries. Isolation places great stresses upon the human
psyche. Secondly, there are varying degrees of deprivation - fasting,
sleeplessness, removal of sexual relief, self-inflicted pain,
etc - the monastic favourites which would be recognised and approved
of by shamans and tantrics alike. Thirdly, there is the constant
turning of attention to the subject of the retirement. The mystic
continually directs his awareness to the union with the divine
which he seeks, through prayer, meditation and ritual. Crowley's
 Liber Astarte  is a fine example of this kind of work, as is
the Abra-Melin system; if you are inclined towards grovelling
before Jehovah. The published Abra-Melin diary of William Bloom
is a fascinating account of the 'self-abasement before god' gambit
in action. Crowley, of course, was much more inclined to lie back
and let the 'god' enter him through the back door, as it were,
and readers are referred to my own reflections on 'passive' sodomy
in Chaos International 11 for more on this particular form of
possession.
<P>
It is the group-oriented form of possession which I wish to pay
particular attention to, since contemporary possession-workings
are most often in this form. In religious cults, possession plays
an extremely effective role in validating belief in the system.
This is precisely what worried St. Paul about the &quot;tongues&quot;
phenomena so widespread in early Christianity. As an adherent
of reason, he was worried by the fact that participation in this
form of ecstatic experience produced a fervent, yet uncritical
belief.
<HR>
<H4>DISINHIBITION</H4>
<P>
The ability to 'loose control' appears to be a key factor in the
possession experience. I have seen people who, upon attempting
to take on a manifestation for the first time, clearly 'lose'
the trance when their inhibitions over what is acceptable behaviour
conflicts with the persona of the entity they have taken on. Expectations
over how to behave, even within the free space of a magical ritual
are, once they have been built up, difficult to shed. The ability
to release one's inhibitions and 'go with' the possession takes
time to build up for many people, though it can equally be the
case that individuals who seem otherwise, to lack charisma and
confidence, can sometimes very quickly 'let go' and enter possession
trance. One explanation is that the possession experience gives
participants &quot;permission&quot; to act out of character. As
a voudou celebrant said to S. E. Simpson (Religious Cults of Caribbean:
Trinidad, Jamaica &amp; Haiti, 1970)... &quot;What a person is
afraid to do, he does when possessed.&quot; Permission to act
in a manner appropriate to the God is effectively sanctioned by
officiating officers, celebrants and audience. However, in modern
rituals, the limits of permission are not always clearly defined.
Anthropological accounts of possessed persons seemingly going
'out of control' agree that any relating violence is approved
of and expected - part of the 'play' of the ceremony.  In teaching
others the 'trick' of becoming possessed, it is essential to convey
the message that the individual is not 'responsible' for the behaviour
of the spirit. Once one understands that all present are able
to divorce the behaviour of the individual from the presence of
the God, the need to hold fast to one's personality diminishes.
<HR>
<H4>GROUP EFFECTS</H4>
<P>
It should be understood that possession is not merely a matter
of entity &amp; vessel, but an experience that arises from the
total interaction of those present. In some senses, possession
is a form of theatrical performance. Certainly I have heard actors
describing an experience akin to possession - that, when on stage,
they are able to do things which are associated with their characters
far more eloquently than when out of role. Accounts of possession
ceremonial by Deren, Seabrook, Belo et al show that the interaction
between performers (those possessed by spirits), audience, ritual
officers and the Master(s) of Ceremonies co-creates the possession
experience. Of particular interest is the role taken on by the
Master of Ceremonies or officiating Priest.
<P>
Keith Johnstone (Impro, 1981) notes that in Voudou ceremonial,
the officiating priests have high status, yet are &quot;indulgent&quot;
 to the possessed participants, who often exhibit child-like,
or playful behaviour. Another useful analogy is the idea of the
M.C as &quot;ringmaster&quot;, coaxing the possessees towards
the ecstasy of gnosis and whipping the audience on. A good MC
ensures not only that the spirit behaves (or misbehaves) appropriately,
but also that the audience participates in the performance. All
too often, I have seen the 'audience' in a possession working
standing uneasily round the possessee, and occasionally, being
berated by the spirit for their lack of participation. Invocatory
rites are similar to evocatory rites in that they are context-derived.
In my experience, the successful appearance of an evoked goetic
spirit depends very much on the ritual space - the use of appropriate
props &amp; paraphernalia. In the same fashion, good possession
working requires a clear context that is known and understood
by all participants. Conflicting expectations often give rise
to results which are at variance with the participants' intentions.
A good example from my own experience is of a working which was
clearly designed by the officiating priest to be the opening act
for an orgiastic celebration. The entity he chose was IUSTINA,
a persona derived from a character in the works of the Marquis
de Sade (Justine: The Misfortunes of Virtue). The entity was based
on the character Justine who, whilst undergoing every kind of
debauchery imaginable, retains an aura of virtuosity. During the
working, the possessee displayed behaviour which was quite in
keeping with the Justine of the book, although that was not quite
what the officiating priest had in mind!
<P>
This is not of course, an issue, in ceremonies where the entire
assembly knows what to expect of the entity manifesting. William
Sargant gives an account of a Voudoun ceremony he witnessed in
Haiti, where two girls became simultaneously possessed by Ghede,
a loa who is known to be particularly sexually active: &quot;They
half stripped each other and one girl symbolically raped the other
with a masculine type of pelvic approximation. It ended with the
total emotional collapse of both participants.&quot;  Sargant
goes on to say that the group was somewhat amused by this episode,
and that the girls, who were normally restrained and quiet, had
no memory of what they had done. He notes that the only people
who were 'upset' by the incident were the boyfriends of the girls,
but that they could say nothing, as it was the manifestation of
Ghede. This in itself is an important point. In many possession-oriented
cults, there is a tacit understanding that whatever a possessed
person does, it is the action of the indwelling entity and as
such, they cannot be faulted. Furthermore, after the person comes
out of possession, they are not told about how they behaved.
<P>
It has often struck me that the size of the group participating
in a possession working can also contribute to the depth of trance
on the part of the possessee. Whilst work in small, close-knit
groups allows a strong atmosphere of trust, confidence &amp; relaxation
to build up, which is conducive to possession taking place. However,
large groups, particularly frenzied workings involving strobe
lights, massed dancing &amp; screaming, allow a celebrant to achieve
a deep possession relatively quickly. Again, the effect of being
in a crowd enables the dominant personality to be shed quickly.
Also, the fact that the vehicle for possession is the focus of
attention for the entire group brings on an excitatory state of
arousal, kicking in the fight-flight autonomic reflex, washing
away the borders of self-image in a flood of adrenaline.
<HR>
<H4>TRANSMARGINAL INHIBITION</H4>
<P>
William Sargant, in his book  The Mind Possessed  makes a thorough
examination of possession-type experience. He believes that the
key to this phenomena lies in an 'abnormal' response to extreme
stress which was identified by Pavlov as Transmarginal Inhibition.
Sargant describes this reaction as having three stages, the Equivalent,
Paradoxical, and Ultraparadoxical. The Equivalent stage is characterised
by a response whereby the individual's reaction to both weak and
strong stimuli is the same. In other words, a person suffering
from depression may react to both significant and trivial experiences
in the same way. The Paradoxical phase occurs when weak stimuli
produces stronger positive responses than strong stimuli. An example
of this phase is the depressed person who does not react when
verbally threatened, but can be motivated by a gentle command.
The third phase, the Ultraparadoxical, is characterised by the
appearance of responses that are diametrically opposed to those
which have been previously conditioned or habituated, and new
beliefs and behaviours may be implanted. Sargant also notes other
phenomena associated with this state. These are: increased suggestibility
to beliefs and stimuli which would not normally be paid much attention;
the isolation and inhibition of certain thoughts and behaviour
from memory, and the &quot;inhibitory collapse&quot; which wipes
recent behaviour from memory.
<P>
Sargant sees the possession experience very much in terms of the
above process. He points out that possession is very much an abreactive,
cathartic experience, and notes that in some societies, possession,
when brought on through dancing, drumming and chanting, serves
to release accumulated tension in the celebrants. He cites his
own work with patients suffering from shell-shock; the inability
to release a traumatic experience from consciousness. Sargant
and his colleagues deliberately subjected clients to an extremely
stressful reliving of the initial trauma, to the point where they
collapsed. Afterwards, it was found that the trauma had released
its hold upon them.
<P>
How does this mesh with the possession experience?  From my own
experience, I can confirm that possession is certainly both abreactive
and cathartic. Intense physiological activity - muscular strain,
hyperventilation, etc - followed by release, are often more relaxing
than quiescent relaxation techniques. Another interesting point
concerns that of memory loss following the state of possession.
This is widely documented, from accounts of hypnosis, to instances
of possession in cults such as Voudoun, as noted above. There
is some suggestion though, that the degree of memory loss is related
to group expectations. In some cults, it is an article of belief
that when the god enters, the human 'soul' is displaced. In  Prime
Chaos,  I have discussed the possession experience in terms of
a continuum - at one end, there is &quot;full&quot; possession,
which may result in partial or total memory loss, and at the other,
the phenomena of &quot;Overshadowing,&quot; where the celebrant
retains a degree of self-awareness during the possession experience.
<P>
Sargant also recognises the importance of the group atmosphere
in creating a space where possession may occur. He notes that
the overall effect of possession ceremonial is to place the celebrants
in a state of increased suggestibility. Rhythmic drumming, dancing
and chanting are three of the most popular means of creating a
possession experience, to which modern magicians have added the
use of strobe lights and audio effects.<BR>
<HR>
<H4>MASKS AND POSSESSION</H4>
<P>
The use of Masks, and other ritual props, is an important feature
in possession. In some cults, when a celebrant begins to display
the symptoms of possession, the character of the incarnating entity
is discerned by the officiating priests, and that individual is
given the appropriate props for the particular god or goddess.
In Western approaches to possession, it is more likely that the
vehicle visualises himself, or is already dressed in the appropriate
garb. In contemporary magick, the vehicle for possession by a
particular god tends to be chosen before the ritual proceeds,
rather than, as in Voudoun, spontaneously ridden by the loa. Masks
are particularly useful in conferring a degree of anonymity to
the wearer. Masks which are particular to a certain spirit tend
to exhibit consistent behaviour, no matter who is wearing them.
As has been noted, spirits tend to a certain conservatism - the
invading spirit may be defined as a mask - an arising character
which has its own behaviour and personality, as defined by belief
and context. This may not however, be the case for &quot;unfinished&quot;
gods - that is, entities who are not reinforced by an informing
tradition, belief system or even a general expectation of character
formed from the pool of celebrant's experience. This appears to
be the case for entities such as Baphomet.<BR>
<HR>
<H4>PROBLEMS ARISING FROM POSSESSION</H4>
<P>
Whilst in a religious context, the direct experience of the indwelling
entity serves to validate belief in that religious system, possession
can be occasionally be problematic from a magical perspective,
where certain, unshakable belief is not quite viewed in the same
light. While within the ritual space, it is important to invest
total belief in the possession experience, the continuance of
uncritical belief outside it can become dysfunctional. This, however,
calls into question the function of possession-experience, particularly
within the context of Chaos Magic. I have often heard an incarnating
entity utter oracular or prophetic statements during possession
workings. In a context of generalised belief, one assumes that
the results of possession workings would be integrated into the
successive experience of the participant. I often wonder how far
this is the case in Chaos Magic, where consensual belief in the
reality of the experience may be shed as soon as one leaves the
temple space.
<P>
A second problem which relates to possession is that of knowledge
of the entity. It may occur that an entity manifests within a
vessel that is unprepared. By this, I refer to an individual who
has no prior knowledge of the entity, in terms of its character,
mythological associations, or relevant behaviour. This is particularly
relevant when we consider entities that have knowledge of specific
areas. In possession-oriented cultures, it is usual that entities
who can offer diagnostic advice manifest through healers or witch-doctors.
It would be difficult for someone with no knowledge of such specialisation
to give a coherent delivery, even if they were possessed by the
relevant spirit. A related problem is that individuals who are
new to the possession experience may not have the skills to accurately
deliver a message - again, the ability to disinhibit, as discussed
above, is relevant.
<P>
Thirdly, there is the problem of fixation. Some magicians appear
to become fixated on manifesting a particular persona, often to
the point that regardless of the character of the entity, the
same behaviour &amp; persona is apparent. Arguably, this is not
true possession, but an expression of ego-reinforcement in front
of an audience. This can result in obsessional mania, as the self
being continually reinforced dominates the magician's behaviourial
repertoire, to the point where it is difficult for any other selves
to manifest, and the individual's beliefs &amp; behaviour are
limited to that of the dominant self. There is often a deep-rooted
insecurity behind such fixations.
<P>
A fourth problem relating to possession is related to the idea
of banishing or earthing. It is not unusual for individuals to
remain possessed even after a rite has been concluded. There are
instances of participants in such workings becoming possessed
hours, or even days after the event, spontaneously. In the religious
context, this tends to lead to conversion. Sargant's model of
possession relates the experience to the release of accumulated
tension, and if the experience does not culminate in exhaustion
(it's own banishing) or collapse, then the effects of it may linger.
Those who wish to make use of possession-oriented work would do
well to bear this in mind.<BR>
<HR>
<H4>TRAINING FOR POSSESSION</H4>
<P>
Like many other types of magical experience, possession is a learned
response. When an individual first experiences possession, it
may have far-reaching consequences as a life-changing agent. It
may occur suddenly, or gradually, and in some accounts of possession,
it can be agonizingly painful. The degree of resistance to the
experience is interesting in this light. Sargant notes that often,
the more one resists the onset of possession, the more intense
the experience actually becomes. I have noticed that, in my own
experience of being possessed, whenever I have consciously tried
to limit the depth of possession, it has in fact, proved to be
much more intense than I expected. With practice, one may achieve
a state of possession relatively quickly.
<P>
Whatever the setting or the context, the key elements of possession
remain similar. Warm-up rituals such as banishing, prepare for
the main event by helping the celebrant to focus attention on
the entity to be manifested. The use of excitatory gnosis such
as drumming &amp; dancing place the body under stress, allowing
awareness to be inflamed with the image of the incoming entity.
Individuals may become spontaneously possessed, or the possession
may be directed into one individual chosen specifically to be
the vehicle. Whilst it is possible for someone  other  than the
chosen vehicle to be possessed by the entity, it appears rare
that entities  other  than those being invoked manifest. As Sargant
says, Christian revivalists do not become possessed by the Goddess
Kali. The behaviour of a possessed person is often very much in
terms of Sargant's model of transmarginal inhibition. Since the
&quot;gods&quot; have a certain amount of regality, they often
react badly to being commanded, yet can be steered by weaker commands.
Hence the 'indulgence' on the part of officiating priests as noted
by Keith Johnstone. It is often the case that the God is reluctant
to leave the vehicle. In modern magick, this tends to be dealt
with by placing the celebrant under further stress - capturing
them (if necessary) and calling them out of trance until the invading
persona has departed. In extreme cases, a lustration of cold water
is provided.<BR>
<HR>
<H4>CONCLUSION</H4>
<P>
Possession remains a powerful form of magical work. It can be
used to derive oracular information (as used by the Greeks and
Tibetans), to charge magical weapons, to share in the power of
the God (as in ritual Masses) or 'live' a particular mythic transformation.
In constructing possession-workings, it can be useful to examine
magical and religious paradigms where possession is a recognised
and culturally-defined technique. The experience itself can be
related to wider phenomenon such as religious conversion, hypnosis,
and abreactive therapy. As with all types of magical technique,
it's use requires careful analysis and evaluation if it is not
to devolve into a habituated limitation. In general, magical possession
is both useful and enjoyable, if a little hair-raising at times.
