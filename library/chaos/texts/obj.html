<H1>Philosophical and Practical Objections<BR>
    to Hierarchical Structures in Magick</H1>
<H3>by Ray Sherwin</H3>

<HR>

My experience for writing these (necessarily generalised) notes
comes from two quite different areas. First, from the point of
view of a teacher who has taught two quite distinct types
of adult - in one case adults whose formal education was almost
nil - in the other case adults studying for their second university
degree or a professional qualification over and above their first
degree. Second, from the point of view of a magician who has had
the privilege of working with an unnamed group of extremely committed
magicians over the past several years. (The reason for this introductory
note will become clear as the line of thought develops).<P>

The recent history of magick is dominated by three principles:<P>

<OL>
<LI>an emphasis on technique
<LI>an avoidance of dogma
<LI>an avoidance of over-structuralisation.
</OL>
<P>

The most evident effects of these principles being put into practice
were that a) individuals began to experiment on the basis of their
own ideas and enthusiasms rather than pursuing training structures
set up for them by "experts". Unconfined by structure, people
were at liberty to choose their own methods, aims and objectives
and many new ideas came to light through the occult press which
might not otherwise have received any attention at all. b) The
emphasis on technique brought magical power to the level of the
ordinary magician, thereby shifting "political" power away from
the crusty old magi who'd not even attempted to change anything
throughout the previous fifty years. c) The avoidance of dogma
meant that people examined many ideas which they had previously
held to be true and found that much of the body of existing magical
doctrine could be discarded with benefit. Some people were ruthless
in their analyses of their own world-views and enthusiastically
creative in the synthesis of new ones. A world view tailored to
one's own proclivities and intentions is obviously more supportive
of the possibility of the performance of successful magick than
a world view into which one is obliged to make oneself fit.<P>

Hierarchical structures lead from the top unless they are very
carefully constructed, and even if they are set up with all
the best intentions they are eminently corruptible and inevitably
corrupted for reasons of personal power or gain. The downfall
of the Roman republic is an example of this on a large scale -
imperialism, introduced for the best possible reasons very quickly
allowed a situation to develop where madmen like Caligula and
Nero could rule almost all the known world at their whim
simply through accident of birth.<P>

Hierarchies are open to abuse, and anyone who doubts this should
study the history of hierarchical orders from the Rosicrucians
onwards. Even in the event of a hierarchy being successful, once
the succession of leadership has been interrupted the structure
shatters, as exemplified by the OTO after the death of Karl Germer.<P>

One of the problems which confronts twentieth century magick is
that of isolation. Magicians, especially newcomers, find it difficult
to make contact with other people in their own area and as a consequence
of this they are attracted to magical orders often as a last resort.
This situation is <I>preferred</I> by hierarchical orders. The
last thing they want is for people to talk to each other. Communication
between individual magicians would not only mean fewer candidates
- it would also mean that their methods might be discussed and
their glamours penetrated.<P>

A genuine network of magicians the structure and organisation
of which had no axes to grind would be very unpopular with some
of the organised magical institutions. It would threaten their
very existence if they had nothing to offer over and above what
is now common information.<P>

A distinction must be made here between magical orders and magical
groups. Members of magical orders tread, for the most part, a
lonely path (and provided they are satisfied with the progress
they are making it is a path I would not discourage them from
pursuing). Members of magical groups, however, are in a much more
immediate magical environment. Groups can be more easily run on
the basis of consensus than can orders, and there is a benefit
of consensus rule which far outweighs the avoidance of leadership.
In a working group where all members are considered equal, in
depth discussion of any proposals, especially planning for rites
which can be philosophically as well as practically complex, is
valuable for learning, reinforcing that which has already been
learned and for permitting members of the group to understand
each other in a way that few people ever manage to do. This mutual
understanding creates a bond which is invaluable when the group
performs ritual.<P>

Working on a consensus basis means that individuals do not compete
with one another as they are more likely to do within a hierarchical
structure, often scrambling over one another for titles or privileges,
rank taking precedence over magick and over the other people concerned.
The issuing of charters, in the worst of cases, is simply an extension
of this - power seekers in pursuit of <I>groups</I> rather than
individuals.<P>

At the beginning of these notes I referred to the two types of
adults I have taught.<P>

The first type, largely uneducated, needed to be
led and needed a formal teaching structure in order to develop.
This involved me, as a teacher, deciding for a number of other
adults what their best course of action was likely to be and then
"enforcing" that programme. For newcomers to magick who have not
yet put themselves through the rigours of training this is probably
the most efficient route to magical proficiency. The second type
of student to which I referred, already well educated and self-motivated,
did not need such a programme. They were sufficiently aware of
what they needed to learn and how they wanted to learn it to use
me, their teacher, simply to provide factual information
or and exemplary structures to help them understand the newly
acquired information. This is a much more lively and fertile way
of learning provided that basic skills have been well learned
beforehand, and is the method most Chaos magicians should naturally
choose. At risk if digressing it is worth making the point yet
again that Chaos magick is not for the inexpert or an easy way
for the slovenly. Its disciplines are as difficult and exacting
as those practised in any other form of magick, and those disciplines
are proemial to the performance of Chaos magick in its widest,
eclectic sense. (End of digression)<P>

Personally I would find it impossible to work with someone I did
not consider to be my <I>equal.</I> In a magical rite all the
elements need to be perfect - the invokations, the weapons and
runes etc. - but this applies more than anything else to the other
participants. If you cannot rely on them to work at least to your
standard they- are more an interference (a hindrance) than a help,
and they might as well not be there at all.<P>

Of its nature a magical group is much more able to choose new
members positively, rather than by weeding out, which is the way
most orders must do it, being restricted, for the most part, to
correspondence rather than acquaintance.<P>

On the face of it, my approach is an elitist one. Although I cannot
deny this, it is not elitist for any hierarchical reason, and
it is not elitist in favour of any particular magical policy.
It is pragmatic because such a group does not advertise
for members and turn down the applicants it doesn't like. In not
accepting applications at all the group can bide its time
and approach the people it thinks might be useful to the
group and to whom the group might offer benefits,
thereby reaping the benefits of positive discrimination. Only
in this way can a group be set up in which all magical
work is performed on the basis of equality and in which
all the members enjoy each other's company. These points are,
in practice, pre-requisites to successful group magick.<P>

There is a number of other areas where hierarchies suffer disadvantages
not suffered by consensus groups. Of these the most notable is
that overall policy. In choosing its members as it does, a consensus
group can ensure that only people who share the group's political/social
ideas become members of it. To illustrate this: I would find it
impossible to work within a group which had right-wing thinkers
as members - I would also find it very difficult to work with
a group whose members did not think, as I do, that the future
of the planet is the most important problem to be addressed. This
attitude does not preclude the formation of right wing groups
so long as all the members are right wing; nor does it preclude
the formation of groups who couldn't give a damn if the planet
is strangled by human greed. What is important is that
overall policy (whether that be stated or implicit) should be
unanimously shared by the people who are working together. Hierarchies,
for a number of reasons including profit, overemphasis on numbers,
and the inability to do otherwise, tend to neglect overall strategies
and, as a consequence, when people came together they find themselves
incompatible.<P>

Most women are not attracted by hierarchies, perhaps for some
of the reasons I have given. Women think and act quite differently
to soil, which is why it is so important that they play an equal
rule in magical planning and activities. Too long has magick plodded
the Apollonian, patriarchal path but that path cannot be avoided
by men simply by pretending allegiance to some goddess or by trying,
with gritted teeth, not to be patriarchal. I am what I am and,
in this respect, it is very difficult for me to change without
pressure from outside the sphere I know best, namely from women,
whose approach tends to emphasise intuition, imagination
and feeling. I am not saying this to be fair and egalitarian.
Rather I am making a point which is at the same time pragmatic
and selfish. I want to learn and experience the feminine principle
as it is, not merely as I think it is or as I would like it to
be. Hierarchies fail in this. They provide little for women
and little of the feminine principle for their male members. Without
women magick loses 50% of its potential, yet the hierarchies stumble
on despite the pathetic disparity of numbers, unconcerned, (or
unaware) about what they are missing.<P>

The above notes are necessarily generalisations since much more
space would have to be given to this subject to treat it definitively.
Obviously some hierarchies work for some people, and in such cases
a reasoned argument could be put forward in their favour.<P>
