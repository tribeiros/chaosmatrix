Indeed there is. The latter is sincerely searching, the former is a
professional asshole.<P>

You say you "seek solid evidence either way", but the logical trap of
trying to prove a negative creeps in here. You cannot "prove" that
paranormal phenomenae do NOT exist.<P>

I once had an attitude similar to yours. Eventually I reached the ultimate
conclusion to my skepticism, and became skeptical of my skepticism. This
prompted me to make a sincere effort (or at least to FAKE a sincere
effort) to try the tools of magick for myself, using my own body/mind as
the laboratory. This is the ONLY way you will ever move beyond where you
are now.<P>

Magick is the ultimate "uncertainty". More than any other area of human
endeavor, one CANNOT stand outside of it and make "objective" observations
-- because objectivity in magick does not exist. But neither is magick
"merely subjective" in the common defintion of the term.<P>

Much of the criticism of the "reality" of magic arises from the inability
of the tools of science to quantify it. But most of the effects derived
from Yoga practice (or Tai Ch'i, or several other meditative mind/body
disciplines) are such things as a general sense of well-being, heightened
alertness, fewer and less severe illnesses, more "energy", more restful
sleep, etc. -- things that cannot be easily quantified by technical
measurements. But they are unequivocally _real_ to anyone who practices
these disciplines.<P>

Furthermore, just about anyone who takes up serious practice will
manifest almost identical results; it is not a case of "purely subjective"
effects. They are predictable and repeatable across a wide range of human
subjects -- and have been for thousands of years. But you can't measure
these effects as an outside observer. The only way to "prove" that this is
the case is to take up the practice yourself and judge the effects for
yourself. I consider Yoga and Tai Chi to be forms of magickal practice,
and the observations above apply equally to all other forms of magickal
practice.<P>

This is what I suggest you do, Tom, if you are sincerely interested in
determining the facts in a comprehensible way. Otherwise, you will NEVER
discover anything beyond what you already know. If you want to find out if
magick is "real", then you must take up the practice yourself and THEN
judge for yourself. MAGICK IS NOT SCIENCE. It can't be evaluated
scientifically any more that any other form of art can be so evaluated.
When the scientists come up with instruments that can judge "artistic
quality", they might also be able to evaluate magick. Until then, there is
only one instrument that can be used -- your own mind and body.<P>
