<H1>Surreal Games</H1>
<H3>by Sor. K115</H3>
<P><HR><P>


The following games and techniques have been taken from the book
'Surrealist Games'; Redstone Press, London. Everyone can experiment with
them, no 'artistic talent' is needed, they are fun and can be used in
artistic, magical and playful contexts. <P>


<H3>THE EXQUISITE CORPSE</H3>

The 'cadavre exquis', whether visual or verbal, was a favourite game with
the surrealists. <P>

Rules for the verbal form:<P>

Minimum of three players<P>

The players sit around a table and each writes on a sheet of paper a
definite or indefinite article and an adjective (neighbours cannot see
what's written). Sheets are folded to conceal the written words and are
passed to the next player. Each player then writes a noun, conceals it,
verb, definite or indefinite article, adjective, noun. Sentences are read
on after a further passing on of the papers. <P>

More complicated sentence-structures can be agreed upon.<P>

The game acquired its name from the first sentence obtained in this way:
<P>

<CENTER>
           The exquisite corpse will drink the new wine<BR>
           ('Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau').
</CENTER>
<P>

The game in its visual form is played very similar: The participants
complete a figure without seeing what has been done already.  If for
example you play the game with three players you agree that in the first
stage the head is drawn, in the second the belly and the final stage will
consist of legs (or tentacles). <P>

<HR><P>


<B>AUTOMATIC DRAWING</B><BR>
As with automatic writing, get yourself in a receptive frame of mind and
draw without thinking, avoid conscious control over the image. Keeping
your pencil on the paper can help the flow. In fact, automatic drawing is
a sort of accelerated or intensified doodling, in which unexpected and
unpredictable images can be made to appear, and used as the basis for
further visual play. <P>


<B>FUMAGE</B><BR>
A method of creating images or effects by passing paper or canvas over a
smoking candle or petroleum la p. The image is then fixed and perhaps
worked on.<P>

In another reference 'Fumage' is described as passing a canvas with wet
oil-paint over a flame so that the image or colours become modified. <P>


<B>FROTTAGE</B><BR>
A sheet of paper is placed on any natural or manufactured surface
possessing a relief or incised pattern. The paper is rubbed with crayon, a
soft pencil, charcoal etc. By combining frottages from different surfaces
complex effects can be achieved within one drawing. the pattern or image
obtained can be coloured, cut up, or combined with other material in
collage. <P>


<B>DECALCOMANIA (with no preconceived object)</B><BR>
Spread gouache, ink or oil paint, diluted in some places, on to any
suitable non-absorbent surface (coated paper, glass etc.), press onto this
your sheet of paper or canvas, then lift or peel away. <P>

Decalcomania is related to other games/ procedures that resemble the
Rohrschach Test used by psychologists, in which an ink-blot is folded in
two to create a roughly symmetrical image and then is interpreted by the
client. <P>

The game 'ghosts of my friend' works as follows: a signature is folded in
two while the ink is still wet. The resulting image gives revelations
about the signatory. <P>


<B>ECREMAGE</B><BR>
This is a form of 'marbling'. An image is drawn into an oily liquid with
water-based pigment (or vice versa). A sheet of paper is then placed upon
or made to slide across the surface, and the image is lifted or 'creamed'
off the liquid. <P>


<B>TORN PAPER COLLAGE</B><BR>
This form of collage was invented by Hans Arp. Paper is torn or cut up,
randomly or into shapes, and the pieces are then dropped onto a sheet of
paper. These random configurations are then fixed with glue. <P>

Variation: the torn paper already bears an image, which is thus dislocated
and re-assembled unpredictably according to the fall of the paper. It can
then be 're-interpreted' by subsequent working over wit pencil or brush.
<P>


<B>GRATTAGE</B><BR>
Process of scraping wet or dried paint (or a mixture of both) from a
canvas or another surface with a blade. <P>


<B>SANDPAINTING</B><BR>
Glue is first randomly smeared on the canvas, then sand sprinkled upon it.
It may be left to dry as it falls, or further manipulated with brushes,
knives etc. <P>


<B>FROISSAGE</B><BR>
A sheet of paper is screwed up, then smoothed out again. When soaked in
coloured inks, the creases take up the colour, creating a veined effect.
<P>


<B>COULAGE</B><BR>
3D decalcomania done by pouring molten metal/ wax into water. The material
then solidifies. The resulting shapes can then be interpreted. This
process is actually used in Austria and Germany when the New Year starts
and is known as 'Bleigiessen' (leadpouring). Molten metal is poured into
water and the shape can then be interpreted as to what the future of the
next year holds for you in store. <P>
