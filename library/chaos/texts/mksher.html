Comments on Ray Sherwins observations on Hierarchy in Majikal practice
by Zona MajiKa Autonoma

Having read Sherwins <A
HREF="obj.html">"Philosophical and
Practical Objections to Hierarchical Structures in Magick"</A> I feel that
a few comments are in order, hopefully constructive ones, particularly
concerning practical organization in its various aspects. My personal
experience with organized work is gained through some practical teamwork
within the Origami tribe, concrete work within several "mundane"
organizational structures, and as one of the first nodes of the Z-Cluster.
I apologize for my English if at times it seems unstructured, exposure to
the internet has somewhat fucked up my school-grammar.<P>

Sherwin starts by sketching three points wich he deems important in the
recent history of magik:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Emphasis on technique
<LI>Avoidance of dogma
<LI>Avoidance of over-structuralization
</OL><P>

Quite where he observes these phenomena unfolding is a bit unclear, though
I suppose he refers with this to the work employed by IOT and various
associated networks and orders. Also, I do not know when he wrote these
lines, if what he writes is an honest appraisal of what he percieves
happening inside the "Organized" magikal currents I hope it was written
some time ago, and that a reaction has taken place, otherwise I shall have
to doubt mr. Sherwins observational faculty. My experience, granted a very
limited one and mostly gathered through the Net, is that most organized
magikians within what I call the IOToS current are quite unable to let go
of their paradigms, not to mention clearly state any why to what they are
doing. As it has been said, most occultists seem genuinely un-sexy, there
is no sense of fluid movement in the way their minds run, and rarely do
you find anyone willing to play with ideas for the flow of that plays own
sake. So while the avoidance of dogma and over-structuralization has
indeed taken place, you have instead ended up with a landscape where the
exchange of ideas has become replaced with feudal lords leading battles
over various points of dispute totally absolutely unrelated to anything
else but their own internal positions in relationship to each others
friends.<P>

It is, however, easy to talk about that wich does not Work, more
interesting is it to try to find Why Not, and What Does. Why hierarchies
fail is easy to see, especially inside a area so full of power-wankers as
that of magik, but I think one concern wich is often overlooked is the
concept of the magikal Act itself: Most "Practitioners" have this feeling
of becoming special when entering into the labyrinth, there is this sense
of "rising above", becoming ba'al shem, keepers of the name, guardians of
the Secrets, or as many IOTs have stated it, one becomes separated from
the mundanes. For me, and my friends, who always have held our parents as
our favourite Icons, this seems ridicolous, and, especially when one looks
at the persons claiming superiority, it can be downright funny. I once
ended a personal letter to a rather dogmatic Thelemite with the words
"Remember when you were Child", and the reaction recieved back was so
scathingly angry one should have thought it was a fullfledged Death curse.
This I think is one of the main problems inside the field: The Ars Magik
isnt something you play with, son, this is the Labyrinth invisible so you
better wear your faces hermetica proudly. (I think it was A.mcKenzie who
said that a movement dies in the transition from Work to Faith.) To me,
any organization built up around a inflated self-image, be it inside
politics or Art, is a failure, because any result gained will then be a
result gained not for the satisfaction of the result but for the status
gained in the eyes of the others playing the game. Wich again seem to lead
to a perception of the World as a grey blur outside the boundaries of
Self, with individuals not inside the ceremonial dance not even cattle but
simply invisible. Wich again leads to a lack of Quality, a missing depth
of resonance, in the Work and its result.<P>

Wich leads us to the second problem, mainly that of Work: What do these
organizations DO? For me, as for Sherwin, it seems that any organization
not grounded in a concrete paradigm of Action is not particularly useful,
at best it becomes a storeroom for theoretical knowledge and discussion,
at worst it becomes like a society club where the members do the secret
handshakes, wear fraternity rings and have tea while chatting about what
terrible headaches that last summoning gave them, or how the new leather
whip just has the most delightful twang. (Anyone read the comic where
Sandman - Theater of Dreams by Neil Gaiman, will know what I mean). Work
as a fundament for theoretical approaches seems to be the only way to
avoid personalities of domineering tendencies to start the "Its my party
and I decide who gets to eat sausage" game wich inevitably leads to the
interesting people disappearing back into silent contemplation or restless
movement, when a structure is founded in Work it becomes a matter of
natural competence and in my experience those that are competent are those
who most rarely feel a need to dominate anything.<P>

How then, to incorporate a structure of Work into a organizational model?
Here I draw quite heavily on the Origami model, wich again draws quite
heavily on its interpretation of the early TOPY model, when that
organization still was something weird and wonderful inside the fields we
know. The first practical point is to have a set of common symbols,
preferrably symbols wich are not self-explainable but are open to
interpretations wildly different. The second is to create a
framework-philosophy, again something wich is far from explainable but
wich provides key-points, be it visual or literal, around wich the
participants can spin their own web of correspondences and associations.
This structure of symbols and words must NEVER be "understood" by anyone,
nor must it ever be termed "truth" or "Core of the organization" or "the
defining factor", at the moment the organization starts to exclude those
who Are not on the Bus, they have lost because they have then defined
themselves, and thus placed their selves in relationship to Others. This
is the third point, the organization must never enter into a 0/1
relationship to any other body, be it society at large or some rivalling
organization. Burroughs writes very well about this, about the necessity
of avoiding the War language of binary conflict, and I think this is
perhaps the trap that is easiest to fall into and hardest to avoid, to
refrain from defining your Self as part of the Body of Action, to become
the 1 in the 0/1. The solution to this seems to beto have a amorphous
organizational structure, built on a multitude of sub-organizations all in
prolific uncoordinated cooperation, with new orgs being founded all the
time in order to realize those projects that do not fall in under the main
organizational umbrella. Member of a majikal org, but wanna do street
theater? Start a sub-org tracing your affinity to the main org, weave in
the symbols in the performance, voila, another departement. Wanna work
with someone else, who do not want to become a member? Start a sub-org,
declare your alliance to the main, and become part of the Friends and
Allies file. Link up via Mail-Art. Do projects for fun, not to summon
Chorozon and the Merry crew of outer Aliens.<P>

Wich brings us to the next part, mainly that of ritual Work: If majik is
to become something for others than kids with a desperate powerneed, a
different approach to the concept of ritual is needed. I do not by this
imply that the knowledge gained this far is to be thrown away, but the
business of shuffling round wearing funny hats and capes while muttering
incanations is a thing that is to majik what the leopard trousers was to
heavy metal inthe seventies. The World has moved on, and if Majik does not
adapt it will very quickly become an anachronism best suited for wanna-be
freemasons without the contacts. Here I wish to point to one of my
personal heroes, Z'evs, who through his Rythmajik performances to me
embody perfect ritualistic Work, combining the element of the Performance
of personal Art with the structures of esoteric symbolism. The ideal
organization, in my view, is working on the model of a positive interface
with the different worlds within the Worlds, adapting its form to the
result intended. Here lies another critique of the "modern" majikal scene,
with its focus on majik as the reason for being. It very easily becomes
like persons who, having learned how to drive in a nail, start hamerring
nail after nail into the same piece of wood, suffuced int he extacy of
being able to do but without any intention of building something. "The
Great Work", "Immanentizing the Eschaton", all of this seems to me to be
part of what I choose to call the Layer of drivel designed to hide the
hollow core of most current organizations, and this in turn can be
psychologized down to modern magiks seemingly universal acceptance of
material pre-determinism and the concept of nihilistic sorrow.  To my
naive little mind it seems that a Work wich does not give the Worker
pleasure is a barren effort, and that a theoretical structure wich is
designed to let the participants avoid the fundamental complex of Choice
and free Will through Hegelian absolutism is at best nothing more than a
construct of stillness and at worst a bearer of the disease of
intellectual decay.<P>

Yeah, indeed. As for women and men and such categorical separations, I
hope sincerely that those entering into the realms these days have put all
that bull about set roles behind them. You Are What You Do is the Word of
the nineties, and it seems to me to be a almost too obvious necessity to
any org wich is to become something else than a college fraternity that
any action deemed worthy of a member to perform under the name of the
organization is so, because that member has found it so. Here another
practical point comes in, that of the project shaping itself naturally
through the acceptance of the authority of the instigator of the Action:
Whoever draws the plan, has the authority of the final word on the
performance, those who do not want to be a part of it quite simply do not
participate. This ideally implies that persons who know that others are
more comptent than themselves approach these people with ideas, that a
state of constructive communication exists between members so that
criticism is honest and the standard patterns of insulted
fractionalization is avoided. Here I have quite a lot of personal
experience, it does wonders to a internal setting to tell people who wish
to slander others that you intend to settle this once and for all, and
then bring it forth, this quite simply forces a crisis wich then will
resolve itself. If people hold their Egos above the Work that is being
performed, they are quite free to do so, but prefferably somewhere else. I
do not by this state that this is a easy matter, but I do feel that one of
the main objectives of any collective organization is to train their
members in emphatical conversation, mainly the ability to judge a argument
not in a term of personal conflict but as a choice of tactics. This is a
area that most of the post-Golden-Dawnians seem sadly lacking in, any
argumentation not employing their symbolical language is more often than
not quite simply ignored.<P>

Wich brings us to my last point of critique, and my personal hobby horse,
mainly that of linguistic Awareness and the emphatical approach to
communication wich is a necessity if any sharing of ideas is to become
something else than a stream of clever blather. I shall not presume to
speak for currents that I have very little knowledge about, such as
Santeria and Shamanism in its various shapes, but when it comes to the
majik wich relates to the cultures of the books, it seems to me that all
too many forget that a ritual is a formulation, a formula, wich is
designed to interface with the mainframe of surrounding formulas. This, by
necessity, implies that the language employed does not have one iota of
independent importance in itself, it is the precision with wich the
language is able to express the resonance of the communicators intention
wich matters, and it is the challenge of the receptor to be able to decode
the communication recieved, if he or she is genuinely interested in such a
reception. Personally, i have experienced much ridicule from various
Norwegian thelemites for using the symbol of the Unicorn as a symbol for
the Graceful Act, a symbol I personally find perfect for that sense of
wonder and clearness of direction wich I aim to express through my usage
of the majikal apparatus, and it is my view, without grinding my axes too
much, that the unwillingness I have met by persons to examine that
paradigm from within, to enter and decode that into their personal
language in order to examine it and see if they can find it of any worth,
is a symptom of a lacking facility wich is dominant in most of the
magiCKal world.<P>

There is no willingness to examine that wich does not fit in already,
there is no wish to avoid the bubble of self-reference, there is no wish
to examine the banal truths and there is absolutely no concern for beauty.
In my view, any Work wich does not feel good is a dry dicipline akin to
asceticism, and I do not think that a ideal organization wich wishes to
have an impact on the pseudo-majikal reality we see emerging now will do
very well with introverted trancendental dryness as its central
substance.<P>

To sum it up, I would like to say that to me, and to most of my friends,
the main importance of Majik and majikal symbolism, is as a tool, as a
language of expression and as a means for manipulation. The first
ritualistic structure I wrote was a ritual for a majikal Revolutionary
action to be performed world wide, this was before I even knew what it was
all about, and as I read more and more I am still shocked to see how few
of those I encounter who I would like to perform such an Action with. For
me, the Italian Anarchists, the last rest of the European Resistance to
the Great Hex, is the true carriers of the Grail, for me the Gypsies are
the very carriewrs of majik itself. I feel a much closer allegiance to
some of the little old Men I find living in the Norwegian mountains, in
secluded places everywhere, than I find to both Crowley and Gibson. It is
my concern, that the whole majikal current has lost itself in the garden
where the four rabbis entered, that we have forgotten the face of our
fathers, and thus are fast approaching the state of Dust, of no
consequence, of no attraction to the Shekinah. A ideal organization does
not work with the concepts of Power and the Act of forcing God/ess to Act,
a ideal organization works with ways of putting her into a state of
Wonder. A ideal organization works with the Joy of Wonder, and this I find
sadly lacking in the modern structure of Occultism. <P>
