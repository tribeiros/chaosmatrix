&gt; To quote an interview with Carroll (CI # 17)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;Sometime in '89 Fra. U.D. formed an alliance with a
secretive germanic<br>
&gt; martial arts group and attempted to lead sections of the
pact into it.<br>
&gt; The more I heard, the worse it sounded. Eventually I
publically accused<br>
&gt; Fra. U.D. of abusing his position and of membership of an
ultra right wing<br>
&gt; mind control cult with a seriously nasty agenda. All hell
broke loose ...<br>
&gt; The ice magick philosophy appeared to be a grim and paranoid
thulean<br>
&gt; atavism which might have had ghastly consequences if Fra.
U.D. had spread<br>
&gt; it through the fabric of western esoterics&quot;- Peter J.
Carroll<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Pete's position is clearly biased, but I think the fission
between RIOT &amp;<br>
&gt; the Pact was a *little* more complicated than a disagreement
over<br>
&gt; administrative schemes (which is what the grade structure
consists of).<br>
&gt; The Ice Magick intro does make me a bit uneasy about U.D.'s
obsession with<br>
&gt; &quot;thulean might&quot;- the Nazi's loved that shit. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In any case, I don't have enough information to know what
went on, I just<br>
&gt; doubt that anyone on this list knows (from an unbiased
source) and would<br>
&gt; tell the tale.<br>

<p><font size="3">Actually, there are Z-list who know the whole
story. I was an initiate of EPIC temple in Los Angeles when the
MT was Kenneth Stone. The problem with Frater UD was not that his
casa had a tremendously difficult agenda; rather that Helmut a (A
Highly Advanced Qi Quong expert: i.e. write for the that story)
advanced magician was creating a subcult within the IOT.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The IOT was not opposed to innovative magical
creations. Nor was the IOT interested at all in dictating to
Frater VD concerning his magical goals etc. For sure, there was
substantial interest in Helmets abilities. He could after all
raise his Chi to a high level of circulation; and hence had
developed extraordinary sexual and magical powers. His training
program was based upon a strict program of activity often
spanning many hours or at least as some opine, days without
sleep. Magical exercises combined with a rigorious training
period created an accerlerated experience, however stressfull.
The Ice Mage was not actually the problem, it was the
underpinnings of dictorial control which created a fiasco for the
IOT.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Helmet was a strong willed person, but he did
create a likely vignette of animosity. As Ian Read and Soro
Benevide explained, there stay was not in keeping with magical
freedom. Soro Benevide who is probably one of the most gnarly
female magicians in the world was attacked by Helmet when she
decided enough was enough. As the Soro was walking out: Helmet
told her she would have cancer in her uterus and he waved his
hand; causing Soro Benevide's nose to bleed. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">That incident coupled with an increaseing
anarchy which interacted with egregoric tendancies of the IOT
&quot;European&quot; contingent it made necessary for the Magi
within the IOT to deal with it. Frater VD had no especial desire
to upset the applecart; he merely wanted his way independent of
the egregoric wave of the IOT. Carroll literally had no choice
but to excommunicate VD after a vote of the pact determine there
was no other choice. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">I can guarantee you that Helmut impact on the
IOT was a serious one; and my contacts inform me that there are
still hurt feelings. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">While I do not want to anyway invalidate
Carroll, Helmut, or VD in this situation; I think it very clear
in my mind, that when one actually attains power; we must
eventually become more responsibile of how we give forth our
Word. Helmet could have been an important and essential
contributor to the Pact; but when one abuses power; one can not
blame others who know better when they withdraw support.</font></p>
