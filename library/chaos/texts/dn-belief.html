Imagination.  People have it.  Even back then.

Ok. Lots of imagination. I guess I have a lot of imagination too, because I
can get out of my body and talk to spirits and entities and see strange
astral landscapes, read astral tomes, talk to dead people... Oh, I think I
can even remember some of my past lives...<BR><BR>

Well, this discussion of ours got to a point where we can't tell who is
right or who is wrong. I believe that those guys got insights of other
planes of existence. If you believe that it was just their imagination, what
can I say? It's your belief. That's what magick is about isn't it? Belief?
I believe in other planes of existence, I believe in faeries, I believe in
spirits and ghosts, Santa Claus, vampires... So what? I believe in magic.
Imagination plays a great role in all this, of course, but it's not
everything.<BR><BR>

This is just what I believe. I'm not saying you're wrong. Of course you can
be right, and I can be right as well, but we can't prove it. And I don't
give a shit about proving anything and I'm not telling anyone to believe
what I say. I'm just saying what I believe in.<BR><BR>
