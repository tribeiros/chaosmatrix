<P>

If one accepts for the time being the paradigm that money is a spirit of
some sort, then one also accepts for that time that economics is the
religion that seeks to understand the ways of money and to further it's
power and extent.  Hakim Bey, in fact, makes a passing reference to
this idea in his essay on "Sorcery".<P>

Much of what we consider now to be civilization is based upon this
religion.  Indeed, it is so prevalent that we are indoctrinated into it
from day one, and in fact make a covenant with it at birth (in America,
taking the form of a birth certificate, upon which your future identity
in the perception of the economic church will be based), in much the same
way that the Jews make a covenant with YHWH via the rite of circumcision.<P>

And yet, money and wealth are equated in many magickal traditions (Hermetic,
Qabalistic, some Eastern/Tantric sects, etc.) with feces.  In those
traditions, I don't think that this is intended to say that wealth is
necessarily a bad thing, merely that it is the end product of a process,
and probably best used as a fertilizer to other ends than simply creating
more of itself.<P>

In this age, however, the Economic Church has become *the* driving force
in the world.  Even the churches of other gods are forced to show a
contribution to God Money or face closure.  God Money must be placated
first, in many cases, to be considered a member of most of the religions
accepted in the Westernized world.  Furthermore, since (as is the case
with much religious thought) everything is seen in it's role of service
to god.  Thus, all resources are ultimately devoted to it, and the
infidels are put to the sword.<P>

With this drive, the Church of Economics has sought to convert the entire
planet (and I mean by this the actual planet and those of us living upon
it) into a vast factory to serve this god, the aim being to create an
endless amount of wealth. It has created a network of priests who know
the methods by which the Holy Spirit can propagate itself (virginally
through investment, interest, what have you) and endlessly give birth
with material insemination (manufacturing, retail, etc.) at the same
time.  It is, as far as I know, the first religion to combine these two
concepts and composite the Virgin Mary and Babalon into a single entity.<P>

And yet, it still winds up creating feces...humanity is literally
drowning in the end product.  Pollution (on both the biological and
psychological levels) is the result of this god having no real opposition
and thus having unchecked power.  Perhaps, in fact, some similar sort of
result would transpire with *any* religion left unchecked; hard to say,
since no religion devoted to a single deity has ever existed in a vacuum
before.  There has always been some sort of competition until recently.<P>

The hold of this single god, however, seems to be inextricably clenched
upon the world at this point.  Try and imagine a world *without*
wealth/economics/industry; it's nearly impossible.  The questions are
twofold, then:<P>

Can a viable opposition be created at this point in history?
If not, then is the "apocalypse" that Economics seems to hold inevitable?<P>
