Hello.  I'd like to indroduce myself simply as Webster.  I have a
serious interest in Chaos Magic, but I'm unaware of any spells.  I know
of a group of friends at school who will accept me into there Chaos
club, but only if I have some knowledge of spells.  That's where you
wonderful people come in.  If any of you want to feel compasion for a
lowly beginner, Please do let me know, I will most appreciate it.

(Note: this fellow has already performed a great work of magic: he's
caused a significant number of accomplished magicians to urinate all over
themselves. Good work, Shuburt!)<BR><BR>

(Another note: Weren't we all in high school once upon a time? How soon we
forget...)<BR><BR>

You've got an excellent chance here to deflate some pompous twits.<BR><BR>

Go to this URL:<BR>
http://www.autonomatrix.org<BR><BR>

There you will find the Corpus Fecundi of the AutonomatriX: a "spell book"
containing nearly 200 collected Chaos Magic rituals, with complete
instructions on how to perform them. Help yourself. Download several dozen
of your favorite rites (especially the one's involving blood, full
immersion, self-induced vomiting or sex) and present them to these
"friends". You will instantly leapfrog over them in stature and
importance. I particularly recommend "The Vortex Rite" (filed under
"Openings and Banishings") as one you should practice until you can
perform it from memory. This will impress the bejesus out of them. Also
download the Ouranian-Barbaric Dictionary so you can be the resident
expert on the Chaos Magical language. <BR><BR>

Now, that's only if you're concerned about your place in your school's
social pecking order. And it's important I know -- it hasn't been THAT
long since I was in high school.<BR><BR>

HOWEVER, if you really want to know more about Chaos Magic for your OWN
mystical advancement (which you will find is the REAL key to gaining the
"admiration" of these chaos club types -- if you learn to do the WORK for
it's own sake and do it well, the admiration will naturally follow and
they'll be begging to join YOUR chaos club) then pick up Phil Hine's book,
"Condensed Chaos" (New Falcon Publishing). You can order it from any large
book store chain if they don't stock it.<BR><BR>

Beware of the trap of trying too hard to impress others. Don't be a whore
to any social order, not even one you admire. If you want to recognised,
DO SOMETHING worthy of recognition and it will come of it's own accord.<BR><BR>

In any case, best of luck on your path. Don't trip on the giggling you
hear in alt.magick.chaos -- it's a form of initiation. If you can't
stomach people laughing at you, get out of the magic business now.<BR><BR>

Then the Old Man of the Earth stooped over the floor of the
cave, raised a huge stone from it, and left it leaning.  It
disclosed a great hole.  "That is the way",  he said.  "But
there are no stairs", I cried. "You must throw yourself in",
he replied. "There is no other way."
