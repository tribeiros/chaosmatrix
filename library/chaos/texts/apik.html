<H2>INTRO</H2>

<HR>
Common to the various systems/traditions/paradigms of Magick are
certain key concepts. We urge the reader not to accept/reject
these as theoretical constructs, but to try and verify them by
personal experience.<BR>

<OL>
<LI>The Whole is encoded within each of its constituents - "As
above, so below."
<LI>The Whole is interconnected, and all relative wholes partake
in consciousness to varying degrees.
<LI>The Whole is self-organizing, and the evolution of all forms
is governed by similar principles.
<LI>By means of a trained and directed will, we can effect change
(probability &gt; possibility) at various levels of organization.
<LI>Change is the only constant!
<LI>The Whole is more than the sum of its parts
<LI>Our beliefs define the limits of our allowed experience
<LI>"Everyday Reality" is not the limit of our experience
- by entering Altered States of Consciousness we can experience
other realities.
<LI>The entities which may be encountered during our experience
of those other realities are <I>real within their own world</I>.
To question their relative existence is unimportant, since the
universe behaves as if they <I>do</I> exist.
<LI>Magical ability is engendered through an inward, transformative
journey.

<H2>GNOSIS</H2>

<HR>
Gnosis is the key to magical abilities - the achievement of an
intense state of consciousness known in various traditions as
No-Mind, One-Pointedness, or Sartori. Awareness is emptied of
all information except the object/subject of concentration. Various
methods of achieving gnosis can be resorted to, from frenzied
dancing to the rapt contemplation of an idea. Whatever method
is chosen, the practitioner continues it until s/he is taken into
Ecstasy.<P>

Reaching gnosis can result, for the religiously-oriented, in 'mystical
experiences' - visitations by Gods, Demons, or the revealing of
Divine Truths. For the magician however, the contents of such
an experience are less interesting than what can be done with
it - it is during moments of gnosis that sigils may be hurled;
that the magician can reach through layers of space-time to manifest
her will, and Gods can possess their devotees. Historically, many
of the techniques of gnosis have been augmented by the use of
drugs - from witches' flying ointments to the LSD &amp; sensory
deprivation experiments of John Lilly.<P>

Any system or tradition is incomplete whilst it remains a theoretical
curiosity. Study alone is of little value, unless it is complemented
by practical messing about. Whole volumes might be written 'explaining'
the magical natures of the various entities such as Goddesses,
Demons, or Spirits, but these are no substitute for the experienced
'reality' of a deity during the course of a ritual. Although there
is much talk of 'magical secrets', the only 'true' secrets are
those which can be personally discovered through the light of
direct magical experience.<P>

Altered states of Consciousness may be achieved using a combination
of <I>internal</I> changes (the use of the methods of gnosis),
and <I>interactions</I> with others, as in hypnosis, group ritual,
or orgia.

<H2>INVOKING WEIRDNESS</H2>

<HR>
My old Adept used to say to me "Laddie, there ain't nothing
you can't do if you put your mind to it." So off we went
in full Golden Dawn regalia to hold back the tide at Bournemouth
seafront. After that he had me doing sigils to make Harold Macmillan's
hair stand on end. He gave his life to magick, he said, after
meeting Crowley in a Turkish Bath, but he had boundless enthusiasm
which was infective. You felt you could do it, no matter how silly
or nonsensical it was. He was fond of saying "if the kingdom
of heaven is within you, why spend more than &#163;10 on occult
books?" Here are some of the things he had me doing:<P>

Everything we know boils down to supposition in the end, so reverse
all statements, or put "nots" into assertions, and leap
before you look. Wake up one day and attempt to banish your everyday
reality - everything becomes new, unfamiliar and totally baffling.
Objects become intense and frightening.<P>

Be Wrong. We spend a lot of time striving for 'Right' answers,
right beliefs, doing it right. Doing it right = confidence = success.
Bo-ring! Be Wrong!<P>

Gods and Gurus. Possession by a God or Spirit allows you to do
things you would not ordinarily do. A guru gives proof that you
can walk a tightrope without falling off, that you can play in
the deep end of the swimming pool without drowning. Insanity seems
to be an occupational hazard of magicians. Better be mad now and
save time later. Harpo Marx was the greatest Hollywood shaman.
Could you blow up a rubber glove and then milk it?<P>

Sanity is 'out there' rather than in your head, since most people
seem to see themselves as crazier than everyone else. If we voice
too many mad thoughts, we get locked up. I recall a woman in the
local asylum who thought she was a bird in a cage - she'd learnt
to keep quiet about this as telling people only got her extra
medication and ECT. Being safe is being sane - not expressing
your mad thoughts. Magick can be about letting your mad thoughts
out to stalk the streets in gangs.<P>

Magick is a street thing. Magicians must be seen and heard. Crowley's
trickster persona exemplified this, following in the zig-zag path
of Cagliostro, Simon Magus and innumerable Shamans and Witches
world-wide. A good magician plays to his audience, be it a tribal
shaman doing Ifa or a street-corner sorceror making anti-cop talismans
out of tin can lids. Learn to juggle, dance, play Irish Stand-down;
these are the true siddhis. If you're really going to become a
jumped-up little megalomaniac you might as well get a few laughs
while you're about it. Pass the Top Hat.

<H2>TITAN-GNOSIS</H2>

<HR>
There is a great deal of discussion at the moment on the subject
of the change in Aeon, and of the influence of various "Currents".
Apparently some people feel that an age of Aquarius - truth, justice,
wholefood, no-nukes and peaceful pagan frolicking is just, like
around the corner...maan. On the other hand. the possibility of
the New Aeon being ruled by cannibal radioactive zombies cannot
be entirely ruled out either.<P>

The twentieth-century is busy resurrecting the titans - the primal
"builders" of the cosmos who appear in creation myths
under various guises - the Giants of Norse mythology or the Greek
titans for instance. Once these titanic forces have completed
their work, they are cast out or banished from the ordered cosmos,
which is then populated with all manner of entities. The titans
are ever-present, lurking at the borders of "reality".
These forces, both destructive and creative, continually appear
in literature as the theme of conflict between reason and raw,
primal nature. The "High Priest" of such mysteries is
the author H.P. Lovecraft, whose "Great Old Ones" seem
to hold a continuing fascination for occultists, along with various
other pantheons of Dark Gods, Dead Gods, Deep-fried Gods...<P>

The myth-cycle of the titans represents the catabolic forces which
propagate change in any system - whether the scale be universal
or subatomic. They are held to be dormant or asleep in that they
are in equilibrium. However, when a system evolves to a certain
degree of complexity it becomes increasingly unstable, which can
eventually lead to either evolution - the system "evolves"
to a higher-order of complexity, or collapse - systems crash.
It is at such crisis-points that the titans once more become active
- when a great deal of instability needs to be built up, so that
the evolutionary "leap" may be made.<P>

The development of nuclear technology has led to a sudden increase
of access points where the spheres meet between our
ordered reality and the primal chaos of the titans. The gateways
have been opened, and the evolution of all entities within the
biosphere (both organic and elemental) is being affected.<P>

As the power of the titans returns, a new priesthood has arisen
to worship them - the power obsessed politicos and their numerous
satraps. Like the inbred wizards of the Cthulhu Mythos, they believe
that the titans can be controlled, and that they possess the spells
to bind and chain the nuclear forces without danger. Unfortunately
for them (and us), the titans are utterly amoral, not being sentient
as we know it. Our only point of interface with them is through
the so-called Dragon Brain, with its pre-verbal atavisms
and instinctual drives.<P>

Titan-Gnosis is the name we have given to the evolution in consciousness
that the titans are generating in Human beings as their stirrings
ripple through our mind. The awareness grows that Human survival
surpasses all boundaries - both ideological and cultural; that
it is necessary to live within nature rather than laying waste
to the environment. It seems that as the titans stir in death's
dream, the closer we are to "awakening" in larger and
larger numbers.<P>

The tricky point about the titans is that for the moment, we need
them if the evolutionary leap is to be made successfully. Their
return is generated the incoming current which has been variously
conceptualised as the 93, Ma'at, or KAOS current. In the final
analysis, the names and attendant symbolism are not that important
- they are but facets of the same process.<P>

Magicians and other visionaries who are aware of Titan-Gnosis
and its effects are now actively working as transducers for these
energies. Evocation of titanic energies into one's own space-time
lattice is a dangerous enterprise, yet there are those who may
seemingly do this with impunity. The use of names, sigils, and
chants are only partially helpful, since the 'names' of the titans
form the fabric of our reality itself.<P>

NB: This essay was writ following a series of workings coincident
to events preceding and following the Chernyobl disaster.

<H2>EGO &amp; WILL</H2>

<HR>
The concept of the Ego - the psychic structure of self-identifications,
beliefs, desires and personifications is recognised as the basis
of our psychocosm. A curious misconception has arisen that the
Ego is a barrier to magical development - that it is somehow to
be taken down or destroyed before one can advance 'spiritually'.
To some, it seems that while 'Western development' builds up the
ego, 'Eastern approaches' aim at ego-transcendence. There is much
dicussion of the 'higher self' which appears after the ego has
been transcended - this is a common theme in so-called 'New Age'
thought. The psyche however, is not a <I>static</I> entity, and
this kind of 'ego vs higher self' thinking is a carry-over of
the rationalistic mind-body division. Attempts to get rid of the
ego can easily result in one-sided development, fostering both
self-importance and a 'holier-than-thou' attitude. Avoiding the
so-called 'dark' aspect of human desire results in a shallow caricature
of human potentiality, a blandness which avoids plumbing the depths
of the psyche. Clarity of thought, insight, and struggle are glossed
over with a sugar-coating of bliss.<P>

To work with one's ego is to begin an inner alchemy, the aim of
which is not to 'destroy' or 'transcend' it, but to move from
a state of fixation (ego-centric) to a condition of mutability
(Exo-centric), which is capable of constant revision and change.
This is what is meant by the phrase 'letting go', and of dissolving
the idea of mind as separate to the world. The Ego remains as
a point of 'I-ness' which gives meaning to experience, yet the
contents of the psyche become much more fluid.<P>

In one sense, it is the ego which roots us in space-time - the
psychic equivalent of having a sense of place, of occupying a
particular set of co-ordinates. The majority of our experience
of reality is at the level of objects, bodies and events that
appear to be temporally separate. We experience ourselves as centres
of will, perception, and ego.<P>

In contrast to the ego, the will displays a vector quality, in
that it has both direction and magnitude. The will is the wave
to the ego's particle. Although we like to think of ourselves
as centres of intentionality, much of our behaviour is a result
of vector resonance - waves rippling through, appearing in our
space-time universe as separate events and synchronous experiences.
A key to the appropriate magical stance is given by Crowley in
his novel, Moonchild:<P>

"...the clever man, so-called, the man of talent, shuts
out his genius by setting up his conscious will as a positive
entity. The true man of genius deliberately subordinates himself,
reduces himself to a negative and allows his genius to play through
him as it will..."<P>

The Thelemic concept of the realisation of the True Will necessitates
an unfolding of awareness of the will as a vector quality. Will
imposes organisation - order out of "the chaos of the normal"
(Austin Osman Spare), and the realisation of True Will involves
an 'obedience to awareness' of the evolutionary patterns which
govern human development. Will is an emergent property of our
interaction with the total environment - it cannot be isolated
to any one element. Will, perception and consciousness - we are
immersed in them the way a fish is immersed in water. They are
emergent properties of the total biosphere of Gaia.<P>

So much for theory. How is this alchemy accomplished? The key
word is <I>integration</I> - dissolving the mind-body, spirit-matter
fragmentation. Enter into a 'being-in-the-now' dance, immersed
in the body of Gaia, within the universe. Will on any level is
the organising principle - kundalini-shakti coiled creates all
forms. Therefore:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Invoke Often, feeling all magical acts as a passage of Will
    <I>through</I> you.
<LI>Attend to the continual reconstruction of your psychocosm
    through the examination of beliefs, desires and attitudes.
<LI>Seek union with all that you have rejected.
<LI>Practice magick as though your very survival depended on it!
<LI>Forget everything you have been told about the world, assume
    nothing and develop your own path.
<LI>Eat more donuts!<BR>
</OL>


<P><A NAME="apik06"><HR></A><P>

<H2>SIGILS</H2>
<HR>

Sigilisation is a method by which a desire/intent is encoded into
a non-obvious form, i.e. a glyph or picture which does not immediately
call to mind the original intent. Any magical intent can be written
out, and the letters scrambled to form a picture, mantra or neologism,
which can be repeated or concentrated upon until gnosis ensues.
Alternatively, the sigil may be set aside until its original purpose
is forgotten, and then hurled.<P>

During gnosis or times of great emotional feeling, the sigil may
be drawn, visualised or fiercely concentrated upon, to the exclusion
of all else. This enables the so-called subconscious mind to 'reprogram'
reality in accordance with will. Once the sigil is cast, it is
forgotten, so that the desire's realization is not hindered by
'lust of result.'<P>

The word, spoken or written, forms the majority of sigils. It
is also worth experimenting with the keying of desires to specific
smells, tastes or sounds. Sigils can bring about a wide range
of results, from the most abstract to the 'mundane'. From altering
dream-content, to habit and behaviour reformation, and arranging
fortuitous co-incidences.<P>

Sigils may be formed in this manner independently of any system
of planetary or other symbols, and can be hurled forth without
elaborate ritual. As a method of practical magick, it is simple
and elegant; its effectiveness can be discovered through personal
experiment.<P>

<H2>DANCING ON A KNIFE'S EDGE</H2>

<HR>
Deliberate magical duels between sorcerors are generally regarded
as 'black magick' by westerners, yet magical combat can be an
extremely powerful way of bringing a trainee magician to full
operancy. Such 'tests of fitness' can be found in the trials of
Zen pupils under various masters, the shamanistic explorations
of Carlos Casteneda or Lynn Andrews, and the legend of Nimue and
Merlin.<P>

As part of an initiation, a candidate may be expected to defend
a spot or object, despite all the combined efforts of the group
to flaunt her. Long-range magical attack may employ telepathic
destructive impulses, projection of thought-forms or sympathetic
(unsympathetic?) magick.<P>

Magical Combat should be differentiated from psychic attack, with
which a large proportion of 'fringe' occultists concern themselves
with, and is largely a product of self-delusion and varying degrees
of megalomania. True magical combat has its own rules and boundaries,
which are known to the skilled, while the trainee must quickly
learn them if trauma is to be avoided. Caught up in a situation
which s/he finds incomprehensible and alien, the trainee only
knows confusion and terror. Stripped of the smug self-assurance
of "it can't happen to me" s/he learns to perceive the
environment with clarity, to give attention to the rhythms and
pulses of the world. Truly, Death is a great teacher. If you can
reach forwards and see the moment of your 'death', then that moment
will give you a glimpse of your potential.<P>

In this, the magician is less of a warrior and more of a thief
(granted, 'Chaos Thief' isn't as attractive a label as 'Chaos
Warrior'). Prometheus is the appropriate mythic image - the stealer
of fire. No-one can fight Death and win, but s/he can be outwitted.
The magician is one who capers and antics, the wise fool. No-one
takes a fool seriously. Become a fool and lay a false trail. Drop
the po-faced mask of 'initiate' and take your partners for the
masque!<P>

The progress of western magicians does not seem as terrible as
the travails of magicians in other cultures. Since so much 'knowledge'
can be bought, the idea of striving against trials for power seems
foreign. This is not just a glamour; life-threatening or mentally-traumatic
situations can open the floodgates of magical ability in a way
that no weekend workshop or correspondence course ever can. Living
on the Edge is an appropriate phrase, as there is no room
for half-measures. A magical combat, if properly arranged, will
force you to relearn what you need to be able to do in order to
survive. If a Magus is going to pass her power to another, she
must be sure that the candidate has the qualities (i.e. a survival
instinct and staying power) necessary to accept the responsibility
(karma?) that attends the position. The aim of such combat is
constructive, but if the candidate fails - so must it be.<BR>


<P><A NAME="apik08"><HR></A><P>

<H2>RITUAL</H2>

<HR>
During ritual, the network of concepts, symbols and mental maps
'come alive' and the direct experience produces a change in consciousness.
Ritual involves sidestepping the everyday world and creating a
bubble where all limitations are suspended, and the power of magick
flows unhindered. A well-tuned group can act as a silicon chip
within the biosphere (we like to think of Gaia sometimes as 'the
motherboard'), accessing and interfacing with other subsystems
via the code of symbols gnoses and imagination, allowing change
to manifest at all levels possible in the system - Aeonic developments,
seasonal rhythms, psychic development - As here, so everywhere.<P>

The increasing use of computer metaphors within L.O.O.N. cells
has influenced our style of ritual. We have abandoned the traditional
form, with its quasi-religious format and monkish robes. The current
trend is white boiler suits, black pumps and gloves, and wraparound
shades. This, together with robot-bopping and electronic shriekback
gives us a distinctive style. Granted, it does look a little out
of place at Glastonbury. Dances can reflect the spiral energies
of the universe, manifesting in the DNA and other forms. The formation
of a Gestalt group mind allows a group to work ritual whilst temporally
or spatially separated, if need be.<P>

Ritual creates Order out of Chaos, a sphere wherein everything
(even our mistakes) is an expression of will. When invoking the
Chaos Current one is identifying with the unfolding aeonic shift,
so that one literally <I>becomes</I> the current, as a physical
locus.<P>

Armed with this awareness, a seasonal rite can become a powerful
focus of change, as the seasonal pulses are directed both inwardly
(personal change) and outwardly (environmental change). Traditionally,
these festivals are cross-over points between the worlds - and
awareness of the internal/external dimensions seems to have been
largely forgotten by westerners, shielded as we are from the elements
by our centrally-heated boxes.<P>

The scale at which a ritual act manifests is dependent on the
will of its participants - anything from scrying the ripples and
eddies of Chaos to warping the very fabric of space-time. The
format of the working is that which the participants perceive
to be appropriate to the intent - invokation may be verbal or
structured from an arrangement of bells and gongs of different
tone. A sequence of dances may be arranged to reflect the transformation
of force into form, or the energisation of astral machines or
circuits. A ritual, begun physically, may be re-enacted or continued
in dream.<P>

We have found that generally, it is simply structured rituals
which have the most effective result. Will is the feather-touch
which can move mountains.<P>

As with anything else, someone else's ritual will only be effective
for <I>you</I> up to a point - look at other peoples' rites as
learning devices. Ritual for its own sake is rarely effective,
but when powered by will/intent, is highly so. However the condition
of mind that must be mastered is to stop thinking about whether
or not the rite will be effective. Lust of result must be replaced
by a cellular certainty that once the arrow of desire has been
loosed, it will strike its target. By all means discuss experiences,
technique, and how it can be done better next time, but let the
intention/desire vanish from conscious concern.<BR>


<P><A NAME="apik09"><HR></A><P>

<H2>MAGICAL WEAPONS</H2>

<HR>

<CENTER>
"Your mind and body are precious tools."<BR>
--Bene Gesserit axiom
</CENTER><P>

Enough has been written of the 'traditional' weapons of magick,
so we will not add to the verbiage. In general, a magical weapon
is a focus for will and perception - a vehicle for astral/etheric
energy (whatever that is). Physical form is a secondary consideration.
A weapon is any instrument which is imbued with power. Some 'shamanic'
instruments - dolls, masks, rattles, drums etc., have their own
history, personality and charisma - they are quite likely to 'bite'
the unwary, and are considered by their owners to be sentient.
The relationship between such a weapon and its owner is similar
to that between a human and a cat - a true weapon of power owns
itself and is quite likely to decide when it should be passed
on.<P>

Perhaps the foremost weapon is the body. In Magical Combat, projection
of the bioaura can disrupt the field of another person, the 'push'
resulting in psycho-physical trauma. Eastern yogis are reputed
to be able to cause death by application of mantrayoga. The way
we experience our bodies tends to reflect our world-experience
- see the body as a machine and it is liable to break down. We
L.O.O.N.'s prefer to view the body as a biosystem, a microcosm
of the biosphere, itself a microcosm of the Universe. Thus the
body becomes a weapon for understanding the greater systems in
which it is enmeshed.<P>

Rather than holding that weapons A, B, C, D as necessary before
one can begin to practice magick, we set out upon our paths and
let the weapons declare themselves to us. As Don Juan says, there
is no such thing as 'an accident' to a 'man of knowledge' - everything
is out there, waiting to happen. Thus, rather than seeking a weapon
out, or popping around to the nearest occult supermarket and buying
one, we attract the necessary instruments to us <I>by</I> our
works - it may manifest by being 'found', given as a gift, or
appear as an inspired 'entity' from some other dimension.<P>

An example of this latter approach is a horned staff owned by
SKaRaB, who was inspired to draw during a moment of vacuity (watching
TV) and hours later, sought it on the astral:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>"...retired about 1.45am. Proceeded to visualise the
image of the staff in an Egyptian temple. Found the staff stuck
in a recess in the floor so that it stood upright. Grasped the
staff with my right hand and a burst of very strong energy flooded
through me, starting at the base of my spine - breath-taking but
not violent. Vibrated the god-names of the staff [received earlier]:
Ra, Isis, Ma'at, Hathor, Sekhmet - with each vibration, the ripples
increased. Changing (physical) posture did not interrupt this.
Let go of the staff and assumed astral form of Osiris slain. Felt
calm, clear, but tired. Grasped the staff again and felt physical
vibrations run along my right arm. Invoked Hathor and mentally
said "Enough - I can't take any more.&quot; The energy flow
ceased abruptly. 'Left' the astral form of the staff in the temple.
Closed at 5.35am."
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

SKaRaB notes that the subsequent assembly of the physical staff
was a transformation in itself, though the aetheric form and personality
had been to a large extent, already established. When watching
SkaRaB and the staff in action, it is sometimes hard to decide
who is wielding who. The weapon has knowledge and its own attendant
familiars, and may yet abandon SKaRaB if it finds someone else
who can effect its purpose with greater precision.<BR>


<P><A NAME="apik10"><HR></A><P>

<H2>NEORMANTICS</H2>

<HR>
Neuromancy centres all occult ability and potentia within the
human brain - possibly the least understood and most complex system
of all. All occult exercises, according to this model, have some
kind of effect on the brain, and it also follows that in respect
to experiences with ASCs, possession, gnosis etc., that the root
event is occurring at a neurological level.<P>

Thus the aim of any psychotechnology is to unlock the powers of
the human brain. We believe that the evolutionary adaptation of
humanity is an ongoing development of consciousness, and the place
where all vectors meet in consciousness is expressed, in physical
form, as the individual biosystem.<P>

Of all the techniques of neuromancy, recourse to Chemognosis (drugs)
is the most widespread across cultures, and in the western hemisphere
particularly, one that arouses much controversy. Only those who
have received medical training, and can hence say from a position
of authority that they do not know how the brain works, are allowed
to tamper with it - through ECT, surgery and the good old 'chemical
cosh.' While it is fine for these watchdogs to impose their will
upon the brains of others, it is quite another matter for non-qualified
people to try it on themselves. <BR>

<LI>Invoke the fetishes of the modern age, channel the corporate
identities of 'Unilever' or 'Max Factor'. What we call sorcery,
they call advertising.
<LI>Rituals to 'Stop the City', shoplifting, rent strikes or computer
zaps are much more fun than all the usual stuff. See if you can
conjure a poltergeist to squat in the local tax office.
<LI>Experiment with fake radio news broadcasts. Make tapes announcing
the weird and wacky then play them quietly in crowded trains and
buses. Watch people thinking 'did I really hear that?' and seize
the momentary suspension of reality to get some off-the-cuff sorcery
done!
<LI>Perhaps we need a revolution of the sorcerers?

We are magick. This is not a boast, you won't find "L.O.O.N.
are magick" sprayed on bus shelters - but magick isn't something
we do, or something we're 'into', it's what we've decided to be.
But our magick isn't something we scuttle away and do after work,
at weekends, or once a week when the gang gets together - hell,
the best group work we get done is when we are apart! Magick we
live, eat, breathe and shit! This book is a brief pause on the
video - a momentary pause for us. By the time you read this, we're
gone, on a collision course with our futures.<P>

Write Your Chaos Magick Tome!<P>

Why buy books on Chaos Magick when you can write your own! It's
simple, all you need is a load of paper, pens, glue, and the mind-altering
substance of your choice. Go to the library and choose books at
random, collect a pile of magazines from wherever you can get
them free. Record bits of other people's conversations. Get all
your bits together and place on the floor in a big pile. Ingest
the sacrament, throw the pile about and start cutting things (not
the library books!) into clippings. When you enter gnosis (or
just get bored) sweep the lot into a big cardboard box. Don't
forget to insert the word 'chaos' into the text every 2 or three
phrases. And next week we'll be showing you how to make a cover
to keep it all in... cue theme music... credits...<P>

This is usually the stage in every Chaos Magick tome where the
authors start running out of verbal diarrhoea/insults and start
padding things out with examples of rituals, spells, 'new' systems
of divination or equations. So without further ado we present
the L.O.O.N. banishing ritual:<P>

"FUCK OFF YOU BASTARDS!"<P>

"There is no tyranny in the state of confusion"...
The Media acts to censor information. All media nets are programmed
to give the illusion of free speech and multiple options. Political
manipulation of the media is becoming increasingly overt...
who cares?<P>

What about the so-called 'underground' of occult 'zines? They
tend to be the product of individuals, orders or groups, and provide
an essential network for passing information along - or of injecting
a healthy dose of Disinformation. We tend to judge an occult group
on the basis of the information circulating about them. Such judgements
are at best tenuous. Over the last few years, we've seen the "Chaoists
vs Traditionalists" debate, the 'Bitchcraft' of Wicca, and
the numerous OTO factions all jostling for position. Although
there is much discussion of the 'Chaos Current', the most powerful
current is that of electric cash registers ringing up another
sale... ching! Chaos Magick is already dead, and the only
living debate is between the vultures over who gets to gnaw the
biggest bones. So climb back into your chao-chambers, spheres,
polytraphezoids and disappear up your own void-flows. A prime
example, wouldn't you say, of the Spectacle "recovering"
a situation.<P>

Doubtless there be attempts to place L.O.O.N. into the faction
jigsaw. Fair enough, but "we like everybody". We like
the OTO, ONA, IOT, OS, OTOA, BOTA, SOL, OCS. We also like the
people who go on (at great length) about why they don't like the......
(insert your own choice). We may even be qabalists
poking fun at the whole Chaos Magick pose.<P>

Chaos Magick has been this Aeon's "thing". Relatively
big bucks on the strength of the frothing of the occult media.
Some say it did for magick what punk did for the music scene.
What follows then... New-Romagick?<BR>

<H2>The Black Djinn Curse</H2>
<B><I>by Hakim Bey</I> (taken from Nox 4/Chaos Magazine)</B><P>

<HR>
<B>How to invoke a terrible curse on a malign institution.</B><P>

<IMG SRC="bjinnv.gif" ALIGN=left>

Send the company a package containing a bottle, corked &amp; sealed
with black wax. Inside: dead insects, scorpions, lizards &amp;
the like.<P>

A bag containing graveyard dirt along with other noxious substances;
an egg pierced with iron nails &amp; pins, and a scroll on which
is drawn this yantra or 'veve'.<P>

This invokes the Black Djinn, the Dark Shadow.<P>

An accompanying note should explain that this hex is against institutions
&amp; not individuals. But unless the institution itself ceases
to be malign, the curse, like a mirror, will begin to infect the
premises with noxious fortune - a miasma of negativity.<P>

Prepare a 'news release' explaining the curse &amp; taking credit
for it in the name of some invented society. Send copies to all
employees in the institution &amp; selected media. The night before
these arrive, wheat paste the premises of the insitution with
copies of the Black Djinn emblem where they will be seen by all
employees arriving for work the next morning.<P>

"That which oppresses us must be in some way destroyed &#133;
All forms of magical vengeance are aimed at the termination, by
whatever specific means, of the oppressor. If it is too difficult
to rise above, strike down!"<BR>
