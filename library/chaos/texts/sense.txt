Subject: The Sensation

Hi all,

I've written this with a view to publishing it in the
next ZChronicles.
 
It's basically research I was working on while I was in
Europe and the Middle East. Feedback is most welcome, though
I don't know how much of my email gets through to here these
days.


Kinesthetic Magick, by MAZE 

Chapter 2            

                        - The Sensation -


I start with the premise that each person wants to experience both
itself and the matrix more fully. By doing so, it attracts and
creates far better (more intense) sensations for itself. The 
difference between attracting and creating sensations are 
typified in an ancient Chinese symbol most people are familiar
with, the yin-yang. To experience the difference involves a
meditation. The experience is kinesthetic, which means you feel
it, and what's more: you feel it within yourself. 

Most meditations involve either visualisations or feeling outside
of yourself, such as watching or feeling your breath. The 
nose is a long way from centre, and we are feeling inwards. All
meditations are valid to the people of the matrix, some have more
intense sensations around them, some give us what we are questing
for, whereas most don't. If you wish to feel the difference between
yin energy and yang energy do this meditation. I'll explain the
difference more fully shortly.

Preparation:

    - This is the same for both meditations and is a fairly common
      meditation in itself.

Sit with your back straight, perhaps on a chair as I prefer, or else
on the floor, or perhaps lay down and start by taking a few slow
deliberate breaths and close your eyes.

Allow your consciousness to roam freely within your body, settling 
eventually in your toes. Focus on the feeling within your toes and
feel the space within your toes. Move to the sole of your foot leaving
just the shell of your toes, i.e. your toes are empty space. Move
your consciousness upward within your body: toes, soles, feet, heels,
ankles, calfs, shins, knees, thighs, buttocks, anus, sexual organs,
hips, kidneys, stomach, inner body, lungs, heart, slowly up the
spine, throat. Then along the arms, doing each finger one at a time,
hands, wrists, fore-arms, elbows, biceps & upper arms, armpits, 
shoulders, nape, neck, chin, mouth & tongue, nose, eyes, third eye,
ears, back of head, top of head then inside head. 

I've found it useful spending 10-15 minutes emptying the body/feeling 
the space until the whole body is felt to be empty space.

The consciousness is then directed to the centre of your body, let
your consciousness sit quietly centred for a short time, surrounded
by the shell. The heart region is the centre of the body for the
purposes of this and the following meditations and is called the
heart chakra, in Eastern texts.

Yin:                                                          
Once you are centred to your own satisfaction, that is, your 
consciousness is at the heart chakra:
                let go of the shell 
which is to say
                fall through the shell. 
                
The feeling you'll have is of falling and the energy is yin. 

There is a point where consciousness says "hang on!" and you climb
back up. You then need to create the space within your body again,
though it can be done much more rapidly as you deem fit. Centre 
yourself again and drop again. Note the feelings you get, but avoid
intellectualising just yet. This isn't head-stuff. These are physical
energies your learning how to experience.

Yang:
To best feel the difference between Yin and Yang, follow straight
on from the Yin meditation once the feelings have been noted. On 
alternate meditations, start with the Yang then follow with the Yin.

Centre yourself again, placing consciousness at heart chakra, then
direct your consciousness now to your innards as you breath. Trace
a mental circle within your body starting below the navel, 
breathing in: tracing around to the top of the lungs then 
breath out: tracing the circle down the other side within yourself. 

Get a good circle within yourself. 

Once you've got the circle happening within yourself, feel the sensation 
you have at the upper and lower points of the circle, that is, between 
breathing in and breathing out. Feel the Yang at these two peaks within 
each cycle.

Chi:
It took me 3 attempts at this meditation before I felt the difference
so persevere if the results aren't felt first go. After 6 attempts or so,
the difference between Yin and Yang energies becomes blatantly obvious
and I can feel the difference now, as easily as I can feel the keyboard 
under my fingers. The combination of Yin and Yang energies results in
the basic substance of life, Chi, which goes under various names. In
English it is best described as the LifeForce, or just the Force for
2 reasons: 
          - It encompasses death.
          - I'm a fan of Star Wars.

Before continuing with more techniques, I'll explain the difference
as a combination of what I've read and of what I've felt. These 2
energies have different charges. I'll join the consensus by
calling Yang "positive" and Yin "negative". Yang is a creative energy,
a potential; Yin is a passive energy, a void to be filled. Yang is 
described as male and Yin as female. I feel these descriptions as 
inaccurate and wonder where they originated. Perhaps the social 
standing of women at the time, being more passive, caused these
descriptions. More likely, it has to do with the physical qualities
of women and men. The sexual organs are manifestations of Yin and
Yang. However, the sexual difference between Yin and Yang energies
is not relevant today. Women and Men have equal access to Yin and
Yang energies. I know I do.

The Taoists describe the first manifestations of Yin as the Moon
(Thai Yin) and of Yang, the Sun (Thai Yang). [Almost?] all 
mythologies describe the Sun as masculine and the Moon as 
feminine, assumingly because the Sun was active and the moon
was passive. I agree that calling the Sun Yang; and the 
Moon Yin is more accurate that the sexual descriptions of these 
space bodies.
I am talking about energy, and access to energy here.
                                                     
The energy spurned by the combination of Yin and Yang, results with Chi. 
This is far more easy to experience than the two as separate entities.
Simply, sit still and upright with your hands about 2 feet apart palms
facing each other. Put your consciousness between your hands (feel what
is there) and slowly bring your hands together until you feel the 
barrier between them (about 3-6 inches apart for starters). This is Chi
energy that you can feel. If you have troubles with this, rub your 
hands together deliberately and try again. I have no doubt that you
will feel this. Many people can see it too, usually it is of an electric
blue colour or else [as I do] a golden sphere, though to date I don't 
know the difference. Often visualising the golden sphere helps in
bringing the energy to your fingertips. Visualize one of the 2 colours
as you deem fit, but not white, as many books and teachers recommend.
White is Pure Yang energy, and the quest for enlightenment needs to
be balanced with the quest for endarkenment if it's quested at all,
in my honest opinion. 

Let me explain how I define some terms: 

Enlightenment is the attainment of a pure Yang energy. The enlightened
direct what they are doing, and know where they are going, and how 
to get there. The enlightened usually arrive where they are Heading.
The energy is one of potential, of movement, of creativity. It is the
active force in the matrix.

Endarkenment is the attainment of a pure Yin energy. The endarkened
finds something to do, and knows how to [literally] ride the flows
of energy in the matrix. There is a powerful intuition attainable
with endarkenment. The energy is one of acceptance, of being moved,
of inspiration. It is the passive force in the matrix.

Based on these definitions, neither can be labelled "Good" or "Evil",
nor can they be labelled "Masculine" or "Feminine", but labels and 
definitions vary widely in the spiritual communities. I base my
definitions on my experience. Your experiences may be different.

An example may help to illustrate, that of a painter.

Painter Yang, has an idea, gets the necessary equipment, and paints
with a great deal of passion producing a masterpiece.

Painter Yin, has an idea, gets the necessary equipment, and relaxes.
Yin lets the art be it's own inspiration and produces a 
masterpiece.

It remains to be seen what Painter YinYang, aka Painter Chi, can do.

So, you've now created an energy sphere in your hands. This can be
quite potent, yet there is more power available elsewhere. Put your
palms flat on your thighs and re-enter the empty space within your
whole body. Instead of generating the Force within your hands, you
generate it at the heart centre, and have your centre of consciousness
there. It's a little harder to get started with this energy, primarily
due to us always using our hands, and never spending much time feeling
our hearts. Once it is felt (connected with consciously), the power
raises many times over. Also note if you can feel that the energy from 
heart centre is different to the energies of the hands, and different
parts of the body. Accurately, the higher on the body you stimulate
energy within, the higher the frequency of the energy. A common 
mistake is to believe that higher = better. There is a whole science
of the different parts of the body and their energies, which deserves 
it's own later section. Known as chakras, Naomi Ozaniec writes:

        "The spinal network of energies is a vital part of the subtle
         anatomy of the human individual. The chakras are strung upon 
         the inner column of sushumna [the spinal meridian] like jewels 
         on a necklace. It is this central column which unifies the 
         separated chakras into a whole. It is possible for high levels 
         of energy to rise up from the base chakra through the spinal 
         nadi [meridian] and dramatically affect all the chakras 
         simultaneously."[1]

in her discussion on the raising of the Kundalini Force up the chakra
network. The chakras, are more than that. The are matrices within
the body. Each has it's own energy, each can be felt. There is a
ritual called the Middle Pillar, published by various authors. This
ritual is calling the energy downwards. If you are a student of 
rituals such as this, experiment with going upwards and note the
difference in energies available.

If you have experienced your own energy to some degree of definite
success, you may desire to enter a group structure.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TAZ:

When nodes (yang centres) form within the matrix for periods of time, 
we have a thing called a Temporary Autonomous Zone[2], or TAZ. The 
TAZ may desire (or otherwise) to formulate itself, or grow in strength. 
The mere coming together has the TAZ potential, so it wants to empower the 
links, and forget temporarily that the individuals have external links, 
or ignore them, thus becoming a TAZ.

To start with an exercise in which all units of then TAZ are in the 
same location. The TAZ should physically formulate itself into
a geometric layout. If 2 units, they face each other. If 3, they
form a triangle and so on. This is a simple exercise with many 
variations worth experimenting with. I list some of the possibilities
at the end of the section.

Each member of the TAZ enters quiet meditation and centres itself 
to the heart chakra. Each member puts it's own hands together until 
it can feel the Force contained therein. Once it is felt the TAZ forms 
smaller groups of 2 (becoming a 2 person TAZ within) and face their 
palms towards each other, exchanging the Force until an energy ball of 
some definite magnitude is felt. If they were then to move the energy 
ball around somewhat, they would be able to discover it's boundaries. 
This can be done by stretching, raising, lowering, squashing, etc. 
Become familiar with the Force your partner has. I've found that to 
touch hands is detrimental to the practise.

Now, if there is more than 2 of you, swap partners and do the same,
with some rotations within the TAZ, you will be able to feel the
difference with the Force of different members (and different TAZs). 
The sensations inspired great joy, when I first experienced this. 
I had always understood intellectually that each person has a unique
energy field. Having done this, I felt it.

You can do similar exercises with your eyes. Again form groups of 2.
The first unit has it's eyes closed, the second has them
open and looks/stares/watches one of the first's eyes. The first  
has to determine which of it's eyes is being looked into
via directing attention first to one then the other then back and so
on until the other's Force is felt. For the visual amongst you, 
when directing attention to each eye, see which one grows brighter.

You will by this stage be able to feel your partner's unique Force,
and in a group you can experiment by blind-folding one unit and 
taking turns at the Force balls within the hands. The results are
surprising, in that you are now able to know who you are playing 
with. All this in one evening.

With some rotation, you will have felt each other's Force and know
the difference between various TAZ members. Now, the TAZ has formed an
egregore, a group consciousness, or group Force, which may be
further strengthened by ritual [to be discussed in full in a later 
section] or by forming a pattern. Say there's four units, Each 
takes a quarter of the circle you exist in, and directs their own
Force to the centre of the circle, feeling the Egregore grow in
intensity, until the force comes back to their hands. By now moving 
forward, and compressing the ball, you have a very potent energy
that you may use for various purposes. If the purpose is to
formulate/strengthen the TAZ egregore, name the Force, spin it within
it's boundaries, perhaps chant mantra that seems appropriate
to the TAZ purpose, then absorb it back into yourselves. You are now 
inextricably linked to the Egregore. The consequences, both positive
and negative, are best discussed before commencing. In the matrix, 
it's all flows and exchanges of energy, nothing more, nothing less. 

To label the consequences positive or negative (whatever they may be) 
is accurate on a level I'm not currently discussing, though I work and
play on that level too.

I said I would discuss some further possibilities. In a short space
of time, you will be able to feel when a TAZ unit is nearby,
and by 'feeling out' or deliberately sensing, you will be aware of
the current emotional and spiritual state of the unit. Note that we
already have this ability, we have to learn how to tune into it. A
common example is directing our attention to feel the ground beneath 
our feet (or shoes as the case may be). We weren't paying attention 
to it before, but don't be silly in denying it's existence. With the 
Force, you have to learn how to pay attention to it.

Other TAZ Exercises:
  - Obtain a collection of items, such as a deck of Tarot Cards, 
    and have one member of the TAZ be the 'guesser'. A sample of
    cards are laid out (say 5 the first time) and all other 
    TAZ members direct their attention and send their Force onto
    that card, whilst the guesser is out of view. When done to
    satisfaction, the guesser comes in, and feels the cards energies,
    without touching, until the guesser can determine which of the 
    cards contains the TAZ energy.
    
    Note, many units within the matrix work well on a visual system,
    that is to say, they may be able to see the Force of the card
    immediately. Still, they should attempt to feel it, for this
    system is based on exploring kinesthetic magick. 

  - Healing. A member of the TAZ has some ailment. For example, I
    sprang my elbow while juggling. A member in full Health was 
    told, in experiment, that I had a damaged arm. She moved her
    hand up and down my arm, about 3 inches away, feeling my force
    radiate from my arm. She felt a slight disturbance in my force,
    which was described in analogy as a log fallen across a river.
    The method for healing is to smooth out the energy by slowly
    brushing along the river over the log, until the log seems to
    have vanished (to the brusher's satisfaction). Expect to be
    healed within an hour. With long term ailments (such as cancer)
    continue to do this as often as possible, even a few time a day.
    It's been reported to me by a long-term shaman of kinesthetic
    magick, that results vary from 80 - 90 % success, a lot better
    than any doctor. A little sad, if your in the 10%.
    
    Note, after doing such a healing, it is important for the 
    healer to ground or earth the energies that have been picked up.
    This is done by touching the Earth with the hands and sending it
    out, or by bathing in salt-water. A simple flick of the wrists
    will send it out a lot of the time. You will be able to feel the
    difference with only a little practise. It feels different. 
    Different temperature, different vibration, different level of
    comfort. A favourite way of Earthing, which is much looked down
    upon within the magickal community, is by hugging a tree.

It is important to note that people may come together for shorter 
periods of time than discussed, say a single session. The may only 
meet once in their lives. They too, may do any of these exercises. 
Recommended is the Force ball and getting accustomed to each other's 
Force.

Chakra:         Sanskrit for wheel.

Chi:            The combination of yin and yang energies. Also
                called in this document, energy or the Force.

Cluster:        A collection of units within the matrix. Also
                known as Nodes.

Egregore:       A group mind is the usual definition. Here it
                it extended to include a group energy.

Energy:         There are many different energies that are 
                perceivable. It is defined as that which is
                perceivable, and can be controlled and directed
                for specific means. This essay deals with
                perceiving, controlling, and directing using
                kinesthetic means.

Force:          The Force is the name popularized by the Star
                Wars movie trilogy, for the energy that abounds
                in the cosmic matrix. Same as Chi.

Kinesthetic:    To do with the sensation of touch.

Mantra:         A series of syllables, often repeated, that
                may be spoken inwardly or outwardly designed
                with a specific intent. Aum being the most
                common.

Matrix:         A matrix is a combination of yin and yang 
                energies. Matrices are often felt to be
                like spider webs, or like whirl-pools. 
                Each matrix consists of smaller nodes 
                which are also matrices, and each is part
                of greater matrices. The Matrix is also
                the name given to all matrices, which is
                colloquially called The Cosmos. More 
                details forthcoming in Chapter 1.

Node:           A node is a centre of activity. It is a 
                potent yang energy, active and creative.
                Between nodes is the space, which is
                yin energy.

TAZ:            Temporary Autonomous Zone.

Visual:         Pertaining to the sense of vision, or seeing.

Yang:           The active, creative, potential energy.
