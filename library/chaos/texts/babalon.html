<H1>KISS THE SKY! A Tantric Text On Channeling Babalon</H1>

   "The Brothers of A.'. A.'. are Women ... "<BR>
---Aleister Crowley, <U>The Book of Lies</U></CENTER><P>

   <B>A NOTE ON GENDER AND SEXUALITY.</B> Though the terms Scarlet Woman and
   Babalon have traditionally referred to currents channeled exclusively
   by biological females, I find no compelling reason that this should be
   so, and believe that in our current state of psychological and
   spiritual evolution, our only limitations in what energies we are able
   to experience, explore and embody, are our own imaginations.
   Therefore, I have attempted to express the following ideas in
   gender-neutral terms. Where I have failed in this reflects only the
   limitations of my own imagination, and not the limitations of the
   human soul as it seeks itself. I hope that all readers, regardless of
   gender, will find here inspiration for their own creative paths.<P>

<H2>The Path</H2><P>

   To walk the path of BABALON is to seek to allow oneself to experience
   existence as pure sensation, suspending value judgments of
   pleasure-pain, good-bad, attractive-repulsive by which we commonly
   limit and define our everyday human experience. To walk the path of
   BABALON is to seek to allow oneself to totally yield to sensations of
   pleasure and desire in encountering all facets of existence, without
   fear of dissolution of the "I". To walk the path of BABALON is to
   allow oneself the freedom of initiating passion, within others, within
   oneself.<P>

   Among the five faces of the goddess --
   Maiden-Nymph-Mother-Warrior-Crone -- Babalon is Warrior. Babalon is
   that individual of power who is open and aware and in touch with hir
   magickal sexuality, yet is defined by no other individual, only by hir
   own Will to experience existence. S/he is that individual able to
   stand-in for the goddess in channelling the total unconditional love
   of the universe for all things in creation -- regardless of perceived
   beauty or ugliness, attractiveness or repugnance, gender, or age, or
   personal emotional reactions. Secure in hir self and in hir magickal
   power, one who walks the path of BABALON is free within hirself to be
   totally yielding to desire, open to that of others as well as to hir
   own, yet retaining hir personal integrity, independence, and power.<P>

   Able to open hir hightened sensitivities to an awareness of existence
   as pure sensation, Babalon is the tantric adept, with all the powers
   that this implies. Babalon functions as skryer, as psychic medium, and
   oracular voice, in the voicing of hir own dreamings of reality, and
   not those of another. As Warrior, one who walks the path of Babalon
   actively works for the positive transformation of culture and society,
   in a role of leadership, through the application of courage, will,
   creativity, love, and above all, the Feminine Voice.<P>

<H2>Techniques for Encountering the Other, Techniques for Encountering
the Self</H2><P>

   a) <B>"Take what they give."</B> In each encounter in your daily life, take
   whatever the other gives you. If they are angry, accept that. If they
   are sad, let that pass into your consciousness. If they are sexually
   attracted to you, let that into your energy field as well. No matter
   what your personal reaction might normally be, whether fear,
   attraction, boredom, repulsion, accept the individual before you
   without judgement. Absorb their energies into yourself through
   touching them lightly on the shoulder, take their hand in yours, let
   essence flow from their eyes into yours. Radiate back to them both
   love and acceptance. Realize that this has nothing to do with your
   "personal" reactions, but is the channeling of Babalon as s/he touches
   the human sphere.<P>

   b) <B>As an extension of the above, imagine having sex with everyone you
   encounter,</B> whether attractive or not, whether old or young,
   reagardless of gender, and traditional sexual taboos. Continue this
   practice until you are able to imagine such encounters without
   excitement, repulsion, guilt, shame, or fear. All such emotions having
   lost their power over you, you will have developed kindness and
   tolerance for others' differentness, for we love that best which is
   most like ourselves.<P>

   c) <B>Dissolve ego-boundaries via the moment of "the kiss".</B> In that
   ineffable moment, the boundaries between oneself and the other blurr.
   Prolong this moment until you feel an energy and awareness other than
   "yourself" move through you. Kiss a plant. Kiss an inanimate object,
   such as a stone, a car, a pencil, your athame. Kiss an animal. Kiss
   another human being. In so doing, you will for that moment of the
   kiss, merge your interior essences and learn something of the being of
   the other. Be warned that the other in turn will have taken away a
   part of you as well.<P>

   d) <B>The mirror: trade places.</B> Using your imagination, stare into the
   eyes of another person until you have "become" that person, looking
   back at yourself who has thus become "the other". This can be very
   intense, even unsettling for both parties. When successful there is a
   flash of union with the other that is a flow of pure universal love, a
   reaching out and identification with them, as all love is union with
   that which we desire, that which we would absorb into ourselves.<P>

   For the adventurous: try this with someone you don't like, or someone
   with whom you are angry.<P>

   e) <B>Mirror, mirror.</B> Gaze at your reflection in a mirror until it is no
   longer familiar to you, until the face has become that of the other
   gazing back. Radiate kindness to that other in the mirror, give it
   your acceptance, let your love flow out to it and then return as it is
   again reflected back to you.<P>

   f) <B>"Magickal Monogamy".</B> When we seek the muse of inspiration via union
   with the other, we encounter this difficulty: the muse lies within us,
   not the other. No individual can therefore give us what we do not
   already possess within ourselves. Though, we may find in that first
   thrill of a new lover the spark which ignites the elusive inspiration
   which we seek -- at least temporarily. Yet, if one persists in tantric
   practice with one given individual, there is a deepening of power as
   masks are shed. Rather than becoming familiar and boring, there is a
   point at which the lover becomes totally mysterious, totally OTHER --
   and thus a transcendent channel of creative magickal force.<P>

<H2>Orgasm Magick</H2><P>

   Orgasm is energy. Voluntary rhythmic movements of body and breath
   build energy patterns, inducing deep primal responses in body and
   psyche. At the moment of orgasm the sense of personal "I" enlarges its
   boundaries, merging with the life stream of the universe, the mind and
   body aglow with a thousand pin-pricks of dancing energy and light.
   Orgasm creates a gate into other dimensions. Where the ordinary person
   merely looses consciousness of self, falling happily asleep, the
   tantric adept rides the stream of orgasmic discharge into astral
   worlds, where s/he accesses creative realities where the power to will
   a thing is enough to make it so.<P>

<H3>   a) Breathing Orgasm.</H3><P>

   In your temple or shrine room, establish a breathing rhythm. Visualize
   the life force around you as brilliant dancing points of light.
   Breathe this light into your body; allow yourself to experience the
   surrounding ocean of vibrating energy in which we constantly swim, and
   from which we derive our being. As the breathing rhythm becomes
   established, you will move deeper and deeper into a meditative state;
   your consciousness will calm, becoming lucid and clear. Experiment
   with each of the following practices until distinct physical
   sensations come through:<P>

   Imagine that you are breathing in and out not through your nose or
   mouth, but through the bones of your legs, breathe through the bones
   of your arms.<P>

   Breathe through the top of your skull, continuing until your mind
   expands, opening to the universe.<P>

   Breathe through the pores of your skin, until your body feels
   cleansed, entirely alive and open to sensation.<P>

   Breathe energy up from the base of your spine to the top of your
   skull. Breathe energy back down from your head to the base of your
   spine, your body becoming charged with energy and light as you breathe
   the energy current up and down your spine.<P>

   Breathe energy up and out through the top of your head, then down and
   around your body, appearing as the brilliant blue of your protective
   aura, growing into the bright blue of the circle that encloses you
   within your sacred space, a circle that becomes brighter, more vital
   with each breath.<P>

   Breathe through the seven vital centers of the chakras each in turn,
   awakening them to vibrate with living light.<P>

<H3>   d) Body Orgasm: A Tree of Night Tantra.</H3><P>

   In communion with the Angel of your Higher Self, bring yourself to
   orgasm, without anxiety, without guilt. Record your visions.<P>

   <B>Orgasm through the base of the spine</B> -- Malkuth. This gives the power
   of tantric energy exchange; the power of distilling the transforming
   elixir as the semiochemicals of the sexual kalas pour forth from your
   body, and the Silver Rain of Nuit falls down from the stars.<P>

   <B>Orgasm through the center below the navel</B> -- The Knot of Brahma. This
   gives personal power, the experience of Ch'i as tentacles of light
   radiating from your Center, reaching out to objects of attention and
   desire. Here is the power to "see" yourself and other humans as
   glowing luminous eggs of light, interconnected nodes, vortices of
   sentience, throbbing with the rhythm of life.<P>

   <B>Orgasm through the navel</B> -- Yesod. This gives powers of fascination
   and enchantment, of imagination kindled by desire; the power to create
   illusions, to create one's own universe -- be it heaven, or, be it
   hell. Here is power to experience the "juiciness" of life, its
   richness, and the sensuousness inherent in all that flows: emotions,
   rivers, blood.<P>

   <B>Orgasm through the diaphragm</B> -- Veil of Paroketh/Knot of Vishnu. This
   gives the power of speech in silence; the power of invisibility; the
   power of the shroud. Here too is power to enter outre dimensions via
   the cosmological Black Hole of interstellar space, matter collapsed
   upon itself by the power of internal attraction.

   Orgasm through the compassionate heart -- Tiphareth/The Crossroads.
   This gives the power of invisibility, the power of entering another's
   body, heart, and mind, the power to experience the reality of Self as
   nothing more than an Ego-less Void.<P>

   <B>Orgasm through the throat area</B> -- Knot of Shiva/Daath/the entrance to
   "Universe B" and the Tunnels of Set. This gives the power of the
   shaman, the power of shape-shifting, the power of cosmic transmutation
   of the primal cell. Here is the power to touch and experience the
   combined male-female / female-male existent as nascent possibility
   within one's own body of light. Here too is knowledge of
   past-present-future as existent in the Now.<P>

   <B>Orgasm through the third eye</B> -- twin-petalled Binah / Chokmah at the
   center of the brow. This gives power to enter the Dream Time; power to
   leave the body at will; power to externalize, objectify, and
   universalize one's internal, subjective, and highly personal
   conception of reality. Here too is power to utter the "birth words" of
   Master of the Temple.<P>

   <B>Orgasm through the crown of the head</B> -- Kether/thousand-petalled
   Sarasrara Chakra -- raising kundalini up the spine, allowing
   consciousness to pour out through the top of the skull into the
   exploding universe, the ever-expanding shower of stars. Experience the
   light and energy of the Stars above as source of inspiration and
   spiritual sustenance, the seeding of our race. Orgasm here brings the
   power of trans-dimensional, interstellar time-travel.<P>

   <B>Orgasm through every pore of your body</B>, experiencing the
   interconnecting points of singing light that cover the living flesh.
   Feel these vibrating nadis of the subtle body, tiny pricklings of
   light that are the blessings of the kalas of the stars as they rain
   down from transplutonian dimensions. Feel the fireworks as they
   impinge upon your body, see in them the image of the universe alive
   with whirling, pulsing many-colored stars. Orgasm here brings the
   power of calling the Great Old Ones, timeless travelers, the gods who
   are ever-returning, spiralling from past and future into an eternally
   unfolding now.<P>

<H2>Earth and Sky Tantra</H2><P>

   Breathe in sun, moon, and stars. Reaching up to them, let their energy
   flow through you. Experience their benediction as a prolonged kiss.<P>

   Placing hands upon the earth (if indoors, floor, yet visualizing
   earth), send streaming orgasmic energy into the all-accepting body of
   the earth. Experience the blessing of Hir all-embracing love as a
   profound opening of the heart into stillness, silence, peace.
<P>
