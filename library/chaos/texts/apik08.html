<H2>RITUAL</H2>

<HR>
During ritual, the network of concepts, symbols and mental maps
'come alive' and the direct experience produces a change in consciousness.
Ritual involves sidestepping the everyday world and creating a
bubble where all limitations are suspended, and the power of magick
flows unhindered. A well-tuned group can act as a silicon chip
within the biosphere (we like to think of Gaia sometimes as 'the
motherboard'), accessing and interfacing with other subsystems
via the code of symbols gnoses and imagination, allowing change
to manifest at all levels possible in the system - Aeonic developments,
seasonal rhythms, psychic development - As here, so everywhere.<P>

The increasing use of computer metaphors within L.O.O.N. cells
has influenced our style of ritual. We have abandoned the traditional
form, with its quasi-religious format and monkish robes. The current
trend is white boiler suits, black pumps and gloves, and wraparound
shades. This, together with robot-bopping and electronic shriekback
gives us a distinctive style. Granted, it does look a little out
of place at Glastonbury. Dances can reflect the spiral energies
of the universe, manifesting in the DNA and other forms. The formation
of a Gestalt group mind allows a group to work ritual whilst temporally
or spatially separated, if need be.<P>

Ritual creates Order out of Chaos, a sphere wherein everything
(even our mistakes) is an expression of will. When invoking the
Chaos Current one is identifying with the unfolding aeonic shift,
so that one literally <I>becomes</I> the current, as a physical
locus.<P>

Armed with this awareness, a seasonal rite can become a powerful
focus of change, as the seasonal pulses are directed both inwardly
(personal change) and outwardly (environmental change). Traditionally,
these festivals are cross-over points between the worlds - and
awareness of the internal/external dimensions seems to have been
largely forgotten by westerners, shielded as we are from the elements
by our centrally-heated boxes.<P>

The scale at which a ritual act manifests is dependent on the
will of its participants - anything from scrying the ripples and
eddies of Chaos to warping the very fabric of space-time. The
format of the working is that which the participants perceive
to be appropriate to the intent - invokation may be verbal or
structured from an arrangement of bells and gongs of different
tone. A sequence of dances may be arranged to reflect the transformation
of force into form, or the energisation of astral machines or
circuits. A ritual, begun physically, may be re-enacted or continued
in dream.<P>

We have found that generally, it is simply structured rituals
which have the most effective result. Will is the feather-touch
which can move mountains.<P>

As with anything else, someone else's ritual will only be effective
for <I>you</I> up to a point - look at other peoples' rites as
learning devices. Ritual for its own sake is rarely effective,
but when powered by will/intent, is highly so. However the condition
of mind that must be mastered is to stop thinking about whether
or not the rite will be effective. Lust of result must be replaced
by a cellular certainty that once the arrow of desire has been
loosed, it will strike its target. By all means discuss experiences,
technique, and how it can be done better next time, but let the
intention/desire vanish from conscious concern.<BR>
