I felt quite happy a decade or so ago to be labelled as a "Crisis
Magician". The definitive characterisation, according to
Peter Carroll, is that of an individual who devotes most of their
energies to normal everyday pursuits, only resorting to The Wand
in times of crisis. To the best of my knowledge, Carroll has never
gone into print on the matter, but from his perjorative tone when
conversing the subject one may gather that such a 'modus operandi'
is thought unbecoming for a serious occult practitioner. Personally,
I would contrast the relatively orderly lives of many occultists
who resort to praeter-natural tactics only in dire emergency,
with the experience of many habitual magicians whose lives seem
to lurch inexorably from one grotesque scenario to another. Perhaps
the time is ripe for a re-definition!<P>

Regular consumers of my articles and lectures may recognise herein
some development of ideas introduced in my papers "So-Called
Magic(k), or Fraud or Bullshit" and "The History and
Development of Secret Societies", as well as an update on
matters raised in "Magical Conflict - The Corporate Adversary."
I do not propose to waste time considering whether "magic(k)"
works or not, or what it is, but rather to examine the elusive
ways in which it can work, to look at the sort of associative
relationships which occult practitioners may form between themselves,
and the advantages and disadvantages of participation in such
magical working groups.<P>

"Orders" and "Disorders" in this context are different
species of structured or unstructured groupings of magicians, while
"Lynx" are the female counterparts of "Lone Wolves".
(Yes, I know there are female wolves, but if one says "Lone
Wolf" in the sense of a magical practitioner who prefers to work
alone, audience perception might interpret the term as applying
exclusively to the masculine gender).<P>

<A NAME="bm1"><B>THE SOLITARY QUEST</B></A><P>

In western cultures most magical practitioners start out in, or
spend a major part of their occult career in &quot;Lynx&quot;
or &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; mode. Individuals develop an initial
interest in magic usually as a result of some personal experience,
or because some book, or even a record, seems to be saying something
to them which means more than the hypocritical dogmas of orthodox
morality and religion. There may of course be some influence from
a friend, a relative or even a teacher, but a solitary period,
which often takes the form of some personal &quot;quest for truth&quot;,
is a feature of most occultists' formative years.<P>

Some people are content with this state of philosophical solitude,
although many simply feel that they are the only person in the
world who sees things in a particular way, or that they have undergone
some absolutely unique experience, which, if it were communicated,
would cause other people to think them mad. In this respect families
are frequently perceived as being unsupportive, or, in extreme
cases, downright hostile. Open-mindedness towards children's opinions
arid views of life has never been an important feature of family
life in our culture, no matter how old the child may become!<P>

Other practitioners committed to the solitary path are those who
have been worked over and/or ripped off by some<B> </B>phoney
cult or &quot;guru&quot;, and who have survived &quot;de-programming&quot;
and/or &quot;conversion&quot; to some other purported revelation
of Ultimate Truth. Such experiences result in a powerfully aversive,
and quite understandable, attitude towards occult groups generally,
and, in lucky cases, can engender the deep rooted scepticism which
is absolutely essential if one is not to fall prey to yet further
purveyors of potted belief systems and self-consistent &quot;irrefutable&quot;
hypotheses. Anyone motivated by scepticism to avoid ALL occult
and religious groups has my wholehearted and sincere support that
is an entirely honourable position, and one for which I have considerable
sympathy.<P>

REAL scepticism, though, demands a degree of open-mindedness,
and I do not extend the above eulogy to include those bigoted
neophobes of the scientific establishment who have turned the
deterministic model of the universe into a religion in its own
right, and who seek to reinforce that belief structure by choosing
to examine only such evidence as supports their preconceived not
for of the way things should be. To such authorities I say &quot;Study
the proofs of Godel's Theorems, and if you don' t understand them,
be advised to shut up until you do!&quot;<P>

<A NAME="bm2"><B>MOTIVATIONS FOR MAGICAL STUDY</B></A><P>

The multiplicity of reasons which people might give for embarking
on a programme of magical study seem to me<B> </B>to fall loosely
under three basic headings:<P>

<OL>
<LI>A wish thereby to gain some personal &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot;.
<LI>A wish to gain power to influence external events.
<LI>A wish to gain power over other people.
</UL>
<P>

In the case of any given individual there will often be some component
of each of these primary motivations exhibited.<P>

However nebulous the concept of &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot;
may be, persons for whom its attainment provides the dominant
motivation are frequently led to the belief that it can best be
provided by someone else who is presumed already to have attained
such a state. This conveniently provides those who wish to gain
power over other people with a ready supply of subjects, and it
is no surprise to find persons in whom such motivations dominate
drawn together. in Guru/Chela relationships and, in larger numbers,
into rigid structural heirarchies within which both "Seekers"
and "Teachers" derive some fulfilment of their motivation, but
where the internal machinations within the relationship or structure
frequently supercede the original intent.<P>

Power to influence external events, I suggest, is something different, not
least because there is a component of objectivity involved. A remote
control for a TV set bestows some power objectively to transform external
reality; and John Dee, Agrippa, or even Isaac Newton, being presented with
such a device might well have classified it among magical artifacts. The
point is that some technique or technology is involved which may do
something as apparently simple as move a small piece of metal across a
smooth surface, or something as devastating as inducing spontaneous
combustion upon someone who has caused offence. Such techniques either
work or they don't; that is (within the framework of a stochastic
universe), there is a greater or a lesser likelihood of an observably
effective result occurring which accords with the original intention.<P>

The difficulty is that in practice one is rarely dealing with any effect
as clearly demonstrable as actually being able to watch an object move
from one place to another, or applaud while some offensive individual
lights up like a blow torch. Where "magic" is found to work most
effectively is in the realm of coincidence manipulation, where the end
result might have come about as a matter of pure chance.<P>

Life becomes even more confused when it is realised that those seeking the
nebulous goal of &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot; have no objective
means of judging the qualifications of those purporting to be able to
teach or bestow it. It is however assumed that those of advanced
&quot;spiritual&quot; attainment have the ability to perform
&quot;miraculous&quot; acts (the Catholic Church even makes such
performances an essential pre-requisite for canonisation of someone as a
Saint), and the field is therefore open for charismatics, con persons and
fraudsters to deliver hyped up phenomenisations to convince the gullible
to sign up and part with their money. In some cases what is perpetrated is
little more than a pseudo-metaphysical game of &quot;Find the
Lady&quot;.<P>

It's not hard to see why so many people with an interest
in the occult keep themselves to themselves, and follow their
own path experimenting with those techniques which they feel work
best for them personally.<P>

The problem with that individual approach in a wider context is
that it is not likely to advance the frontiers of human
knowledge very much. Given that the matter under consideration
has the appearance of a species of unfolding science and/or
technology, few major advances in such disciplines over the years
have been made by individuals working entirely alone. The cross-fertilisation
of ideas and experiences which inevitably results from working
together with other members of a team is a major component
in producing the quantum leaps in understanding and perception
which characterise major advances. Thus there is some further
motivation for those practitioners who have become convinced,
from their own experience, that &quot;magical&quot; effects do
have some basis in fact, to ally themselves with other
like minded individuals, and to form groups in order to pool knowledge
and combine their efforts.<P>

<A NAME="bm3"><B>CONTEMPORARY CHURCHES, CULTS AND MAGICAL GROUPS</B></A><P>

Most churches, cults and magical groups adhere to some
sort of belief structure which presents their organisation as
the custodians of THE &quot;Ultimate Truth&quot;. In some cases
this &quot;Truth&quot; derives from historical tradition, as with,
say, mainstream Christianity or Freemasonry, in other cases the
fountainhead is entirely modern (as with the quasi-rationalist
'Nuclear Power Dogma'), or consists of a modern re-interpretation
of more ancient source material.<P>

Most of these religions, for in one sense or another that is what
they are, publish their irrefutable hypothesis in the public domain,
so that it least it is available for adherents and querents to
consider and debate openly. A minority, particularly among the
more occult oriented organisations, present a concept of a &quot;truth&quot;
which is so wonderful or awesome that it has to be concealed from
the &quot;profane&quot; (i.e. outsiders) and in some cases restricted
to the highest echelons of a heirarchica1 structure, with dissemination
prohibited by oaths of secrecy.<P>

A single category of occult persuasion, the Chaos Magicians, argue
from both a philosophical and an objective mathematical standpoint
that &quot;there can be NO ultimate truth&quot; and treat &quot;belief&quot;
as a technical expedient which can be temporarily useful in accomplishing
particular magical objectives.<P>

Since the inception of Chaos Magic in its a modern form in the
late 1970s, there has been considerable debate among its adherents
concerning the most appropriate collective structure for pursuit
and development of the philosophy and associated magical techniques.<P>

<A NAME="bm4"><B>ORDERS AND DISORDERS</B></A><P>

Anyone interested in serious ceremonial/ritual magic in London
in the early 1970s had little alternative but to follow the path
of the Lone Wolf. The blues musician Graham Bond had made an attempt
to introduce a brand of Thelemic. Masonry to young members of
the Notting Hill sub-culture in the late. 60's but any remnant
of that died with him in 1974, while the mainstream Freemasons,
inasmuch as they were recruiting at all, were concentrating on
public school Old Boy Associations and their usual hunting grounds
in the police and other uniformed public services If any rump
of the pre-war ceremonial orders, the Golden Dawn, the OTO, A.'.A.'.,
M.'.M.'., or Stella Matutina still existed, then their ageing
membership was maintaining a low profile. Crowley books were out
of print, hard to find, and costly; indeed pretty well the only
published system for magical self-initiation was the Mathers edition
of &quot;The Sacred Magic Of Abra-Melin the Mage&quot; , which,
although perhaps effective, was scarcely popular because of its
masculine bias and requirement for months of sexual abstinence.
Occasional reprints of Austin Spare' s work were sighted, mostly
third generation photocopies.<P>

If you wanted to become involved In working with a group it was
down to the Theosophists, Rudolph Steiner's Anthroposophy, White
Eagle Lodge, or the AMORC Rosicrucians, In all of which &quot;sex
and drugs and rock and roll&quot; were definitely frowned upon.
Alternatively there was Scientology, Guru Maharaji's 'Divine Light',
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation, and Hare
Krishna, which were all widely felt to be rip offs of one sort
or another.<P>

Into this magical wasteland of London in November 1974 was suddenly
projected the now famed classified advertisement in Time Out Magazine:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>MAGIC. Serious student of occult has access to Golden Dawn
Records and wishes to form similar society more suited to current
trends - but perhaps retaining many of the GD grades and initiation
processes. Invitation to write and discuss the project more fully
is open to all with a more than passing interest in magical ceremonies
and of course practical instruction is available to the novice.
Please feel free to write whatever your Interpretation of the
essential truth. The combined study of magic for the common good
can only be beneficial to humanity. Box 247/20.<BR>
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Around 20 Lone Wolves (all male) replied and were disappointed
to discover that the advertiser was not what he purported to be,
and that he had little interest in organising a re-constituted
Order of the Golden Dawn. At a meeting of the respondents, though,
several of them, including Peter Carroll and myself, decided to
meet regularly and to contribute ideas for ritual work which other
participants could join in with.<P>

The group never had a formal working name at the time - the original
correspondence file is marked &quot;Magical Study Group&quot;
- but it has come to be referred to as &quot;Stoke Newington Sorcerors&quot;
(SNS) since most of the meetings took place in a house in that
part of London.<P>

Although there were many discussions about instituting some sort
of formal structure, it was generally resisted, partly because
none of the original members was prepared to cede superiority
to any of the others, and although later arrivals attempted to
usurp a leadership role, they were customarily given short shrift.
A nucleus of SNS members eventually wound up living in close proximity
during 1977/8 in the notorious Speedwell House (in Deptford, South
East London) where they became entwined in the nascent anarchy
of the explosion of 'Punk' fashion. The street-cred magical names
like Frater Autonemesis and Frater Choronzon date from this period,
and, in terms of lifestyle, Chaos was King; the philosophical
dimension developed from that point.<P>

Peter Carroll and myself were both writing for the small circulation
&quot;New Equinox&quot; magazine which was being published by
Ray Sherwin out of East Morton in Yorkshire, and it was at this
time that Pete produced a magical training syllabus based on exercises
he was using himself which were drawn in part from yogic sources
as well as having some input from Crowley, Spare and Castenada.
The essence of Carroll's own work there was in stripping away
the bullshit, and encapsulating the most useful techniques in
a booklet of no more than 7 typed A4 sheets titled &quot;LIBER
MMM A Publication of the Magical Order of the IOT - Being the
Initial Instructions in Mind Control, Metamorphosis and Magic
for applicants to the IOT.&quot;<P>

IOT, of course, is &quot;Illuminates Of Thanateros&quot;; the
name itself perhaps owing some debt of inspiration not only to
Spare, but also to Robert(s) Shea and Anton Wilson, whose conspiracy
theorist trilogy &quot;Illuminatus&quot; had enjoyed a measure
of acclaim, along with its stage adaptation. Because of the short
term nature of the Speedwell House domicile, and the requirement
for applicants to work "Liber MMM" for at least six months before
submitting a magical record for consideration, the correspondence
address was that of Ray Sherwin's "Morton Press." The same imprimateur
is to be found on the earliest editions of Carroll's first book
"Liber Null", which includes "Liber MMM" as the opening chapter.<P>

There are a few interesting features about the earliest versions
of "Liber MMM" which are relevant to the issues discussed in this
paper Firstly the IOT is presented as a magical ORDER.
Secondly, there is no mention at all of Chaos; and, thirdly,
under the heading "Structure", Carroll states &quot;There is no
heirarchy in the IOT&quot;. Albeit that he goes on to outline
&quot;a division of activity based on ability&quot;, with roles
for Students, Initiates, Adepts and Masters being detailed. I
highlight those features of the original concept because minor
amendments were made in later versions of &quot;Liber MMM&quot;
and because the preamble which includes the material on "Structure"
has disappeared from that section in the later Weiser edition
of "Liber Null and Psychonaut" combined.<P>

The key point about that inaugural stage in the IOT's history
is that although it was presented as an ORDER, the structure (like
that of SNS before it) was a non-heirarchial DISORDER, albeit
that there was no explicit reference to CHAOS.<P>

During the five years or so following the demolition of Speedwell
House, "Liber Null" was followed by "Psychonaut" and the locus
of Chaos Magic moved to West Yorkshire. A German translation appeared
and some contact was established with a few hardy individuals
who had worked through the "Liber MMM" syllabus and who submitted
creditable records of their experiences.<P>

Eventually in 1986 the first edition of &quot;Chaos International&quot;
appeared under the editorship of P.D. Brown and Ray Sherwin. A
glance at the first Editorial shows that the anti-hierarchical
posture of Chaos Magic had survived intact from the earliest days
of the IOT. The following extract makes the philosophical position
at that time quite clear:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Hierarchy fails for many reasons, not least of which
is that it is eminently corruptible. From the magical point of
view hierarchy, except when its leaders genuinely have the interests
of their aspirants at heart, is stifling and inertial, the development
of individuals taking fourth place to power play, internal politics
and finance.&quot;
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

By this time Chaos Magic was being marketed enthusiastically in
the German speaking countries of continental Europe through the
efforts of Ralph Tegtmeier, who had published the translations
of Carroll's work. Some impetus was building, largely from that
quarter, for the IOT to be restructured in a more formalised way,
and eventually in Autumn 1987, &quot;Chaos International&quot;
Issue #3 carried two articles by Peter Carroll titled respectively
&quot;The Pact&quot; and &quot;The Magical Pact of the Illuminates
of Thanateros&quot; which set out a system of formal grades which
closely corresponded to the &quot;divisions of activity&quot;
from the &quot;Structure&quot; paragraph in the original Speedwell
House recension of "Liber MMM"; although with the addition of
the post of Supreme Magus 0 degree. (These articles are reprinted,
more or less verbatim, under the general title 'Liber Pactionis'
as part of the Appendix to Carroll's latest book 'Liber Kaos,
The Psychonomicon'.<P>

Perhaps to assuage the feelings of the English speaking anti-heirarchs
the following passage was prominently included:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The prime functions of the grade structure are to provide
a mechanism for the exclusion of certain psychotic misanthropes
and neurotic creeps who are sometimes attracted to such enterprises
and to ensure that that which needs organising is duly attended
to.&quot;
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The hallmarks of a carefully thought out compromise are discernible.
In particular an &quot;Office of Insubordinate&quot; is introduced
to force &quot;a constant stream of negative feedback to arise-
from below by institutionalising rebellion.&quot; The objective
being to circumvent one of the more notorious drawbacks of heirarchies
where &quot;those at the top are condemned to bask in deceitful
reflections of their own expectations and to issue even more inappropriate
directives. Such an office is understood to have some precedent
in Amerindian and other shamanic societies (ref: Neonfaust - Letter
in Chaos International #4).<P>

That there were some misgivings about the whole idea of an 'Order'
devoted to 'Chaos' among prominent practitioners is clear from
the article by Ray Sherwin which immediately follows those by
Carroll in Chaos International #3. Under the headline &quot;Philosophical
and Practical Objections to Hierarchical Structures in Magick&quot;
he writes: &quot;Hierarchies are open to abuse&quot; and, echoing
the editorial in "Chaos International #1", &quot;even if they
are set up with all the best intentions they are eminently corruptible
and inevitably corrupted for reasons of personal power or gain&quot;.<P>

Sherwin then makes a clear distinction between magical orders
and consensus based magical groups:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Working on a consensus basis means that individuals do
not compete with one another as they are more likely to do within
a hierarchical structure, often scrambling over one another for
titles and privileges, rank taking precedence over magick and
over the other people concerned. The issuing of charters, in the
worst of cases, is simply an extension of this - the power seekers
in pursuit of groups rather than individuals.&quot;
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

In the same piece Sherwin carries on to make valid points about
the unattractiveness of hierarchies to females, and he comments
&quot;without women magick loses 50% of its potential&quot;. He
concludes: &quot;If you're interested in magick but don't want
to get involved in hierarchical structures, 'Unorganised Chaos'
may be of interest to you&quot;, and refers readers to a contact
address elsewhere in the magazine.<P>

The debate continues in Issue #4 of 'Chaos International' which
appeared In Spring 1988 carrying a letter- from one 'Neonfaust
I' who proclaims himself as 1st Degree IOT West Germany. He introduces
the subject thus:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;While I do see Ray Sherwin's point in general, I still
think that his philosophical and practical objections to hierarchical
structures in magic are indeed purely the arguments of an insider
working within a well established group.
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This is a fact - Sherwin was one of the most prominent members
of the IOT as originally constituted!<P>

'Neonfaust' continues:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Working on similar lines myself on the one hand, but
actively participating in a highly hierarchically structured magical
order as well, I feel that he has not done hierarchy full justice.
For one thing hiearchy is basically STRUCTURE [sic (emphasis)]
and as such it can be one of the strongest weapons against the
many pitfalls of magic which have been, I will concede, highly
overestimated in the past but which are there to be reckoned with
nonetheless.&quot;
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Among his examples of such pitfalls, 'Neonfaust' gives prominence
to &quot;self delusion&quot; and &quot;individualistic megalomania.&quot;<P>

It may be, when the 'The Saga of the Ice' is submitted to similar
critical analysis, that illumination is cast on the extent to
which the abuse of hierarchical power served to mask the reality
that this individual was actually wallowing those very pitfalls
he so accurately identifies.<P>

There is, I feel, one drawback to establishing a hierarchical
structure which is not mentioned in any of the source material
cited here. The structure set out in 'Liber Pactionis' may work
fine if viewed as an established on-going procedural environment
for magical work. What it does not adequately cover is the process
for setting the hierarchy up in the first place.<P>

My own misgivings about hierarchies are engendered partly because
I feel they unecessarily restrict information about useful magical
work being carried out. In the prevailing social environment,
burdened as we are with an intrusive press seeking any excuse
to publish sensational 'occult' stories, I completely concur with
the need to preserve confidentiality concerning the identities
of individuals involved in private magical work. I do not feel
that this secrecy should necessarily be extended to the work itself
- particularly if significant advances in knowledge and/or techniques
are being made. For that reason I have made a habit of conducting
a significant proportion of my own magical work outside the confines
of formal temple settings, if not always completely in the public
domain. I see such activities as being a logical extension of
the sort of work I was doing when others chose to characterise
me as a Crisis Magician.<P>

<A NAME="bm5"><B>ONCE A CRISIS MAGICIAN - ALWAYS A CRISIS MAGICIAN</B></A>
<P>

If one faces some dire life threatening emergency, in physical
terms, the body produces a surge of adrenaline which can bestow
a physical boost to empower one to get out of the situation. This
sort of circumstance will be familiar to anyone who has ever been
in an awkward scrape while pot-holing, for example. My strong
impression is that something similar happens when one applies
a magical solution to some pressing circumstance threatening to
one's life and security or that of one's dependents. If such a
magical working becomes necessary, it is my experience that it
is ALWAYS successful - Gnosis through Crisis.<P>

With the recent success of a long and complex legal and magical
operation against a Goliath of a corporate adversary, I can make
that statement quite categorically.<P>

I will no longer tolerate being ripped off or worked over by large
corporations, who consider that they have some right in natural
law to behave like that simply because of their size. I may have
to allow the situation to proceed to a point where my own position
becomes sufficiently perilous that the 'magical adrenaline' surge
seals the outcome, but it works in the end. That is the essence
of Crisis Magic.<P>

<A NAME="bm6"><B>TOWARDS PRECISION IN MAGIC</B></A><P>

In my recent review of Peter Carroll's book 'Liber Kaos, the Psychonomicon',
I was prompted to draw a comparison between progress in the understanding
of so-called 'magic', and the history of the comprehension of
electro-magnetic radiation by 19th century science. The Danish
physicist Hans Oersted first noticed in 1820 that a high voltage
spark generated across a gap in a metallic loop could induce a
similar, though smaller, spark to occur across a gap in a similar
loop on the other side of his workshop. You can observe the same
sort of effect at work today when you are trying to record something
off the radio, and your neighbour gets to work with his ancient
(unsuppressed) electric drill - sparks cause 'white noise' radio
emissions across the entire frequency band. It was some twenty
years before Faraday began to arrive at some coherent understanding
of what was going on, and not until 1865 that James Clark Maxwell
put forward his famous wave equations which described the process
in precise mathematical terms. After another 30 years Marconi
had built the first reliable radio set which could send and receive
coherent information carrying signals at discrete wavelengths.<P>

My view is that in terms of magic we are past the 'Oersted' stage,
in which we can do simple things - the equivalent of undifferentiated
spark transmission - on a reasonably consistent quantifiable basis.
Now, the first attempts are being made to propose a quantitative
model with Carroll's &quot;Equations of Magic&quot; in 'Liber
Kaos', and it may be that those equations, in times to come, will
assume as much importance in the emerging science and technology
of 'magic' as those of Maxwell have done in radio engineering.<P>

If we are now, by comparison, only a little further on than being
able to send out sparks from a Van Der Graaf generator, think
what could be accomplished when the 'magical' analogues of separated
wavelengths, frequency modulation and/or radar technology come
to be understood. I feel it is not unreasonable to assert that
we may be on the threshold of some major discoveries, and happily
for us all, the scientific/technical establishment is looking
the other way because of their slavish belief in a deterministic
universe, and their refusal to accept the reality of any phenomena
which threaten that belief - and this despite Godel's Theorems
having been published half a century ago!<P>

The key to progress, in my view, is to strive to achieve greater
precision in magical actions, with increasingly precise statements
of intent, possibly sigilized into systems diagrams mapping detailed
effects. For example, if you feel moved to take magical action
against a bank for, say deducting bank charges from your account
without notice and then bouncing a cheque presented by your lawyers
(which can be very embarassing); then you want to ensure that
the curse is effective against all the lifts in their head office,
and not against all their cash-point machines in a 6.66 mile radius;
particularly if the working has been conducted publically. Alternatively,
on a more personal level, you want to make sure that it is the
offending manager who suffers the fit of projectile vomiting,
and not the hapless secretary who chances to open the letter with
the runes drawn under the postage stamp.<P>

Whatever happens, never let life get on top of you - always keep
the Wand and the Thunderbolt handy in times of crisis.<P>
