It is with great sorrow that I inform this newsgroup
that a great frater, friend and Elder of the IOT
passed away.  The Psychonaut William Seward Burroughs moved onto
new explorations in the early morning of Saturday, August 2nd.
William was an incredible human being... veiwing life a step
ahead of his generation.  A gentleman who pushed the
limits of the literary and art worlds as well as the magick
within it all.  Those that performed
magical acts and rituals with him will never forget
his childlike wonder and love of magick.
William was no armchair magician... to watch him
paint his sigils... to be spinning, laughing and
yelling in the midst of a invocation of chaos and
just two months ago yesterday when
I watched him perform acts of magick, with a North
American Indian Shaman and
a group of Vietnam Vets, shooting his .45 at painted
sigils to activate them.  <P>

Thank you Frater Dalhfar.23 for your inspiration,
your friendship, your magick and most of all
the mark on this world that you made...
you are a great magician with a fortitude of
the gods of chaos... keep on doing what you
do best and turn the netherworld
upsidedown. <P>

In Chaos,<P>
