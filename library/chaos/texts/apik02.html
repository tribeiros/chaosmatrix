<H2>GNOSIS</H2>

<HR>
Gnosis is the key to magical abilities - the achievement of an
intense state of consciousness known in various traditions as
No-Mind, One-Pointedness, or Sartori. Awareness is emptied of
all information except the object/subject of concentration. Various
methods of achieving gnosis can be resorted to, from frenzied
dancing to the rapt contemplation of an idea. Whatever method
is chosen, the practitioner continues it until s/he is taken into
Ecstasy.<P>

Reaching gnosis can result, for the religiously-oriented, in 'mystical
experiences' - visitations by Gods, Demons, or the revealing of
Divine Truths. For the magician however, the contents of such
an experience are less interesting than what can be done with
it - it is during moments of gnosis that sigils may be hurled;
that the magician can reach through layers of space-time to manifest
her will, and Gods can possess their devotees. Historically, many
of the techniques of gnosis have been augmented by the use of
drugs - from witches' flying ointments to the LSD &amp; sensory
deprivation experiments of John Lilly.<P>

Any system or tradition is incomplete whilst it remains a theoretical
curiosity. Study alone is of little value, unless it is complemented
by practical messing about. Whole volumes might be written 'explaining'
the magical natures of the various entities such as Goddesses,
Demons, or Spirits, but these are no substitute for the experienced
'reality' of a deity during the course of a ritual. Although there
is much talk of 'magical secrets', the only 'true' secrets are
those which can be personally discovered through the light of
direct magical experience.<P>

Altered states of Consciousness may be achieved using a combination
of <I>internal</I> changes (the use of the methods of gnosis),
and <I>interactions</I> with others, as in hypnosis, group ritual,
or orgia.
