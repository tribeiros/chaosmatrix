<H1>Obituary for the Chaos Current</H1>

In the last year or so Since NOX #5, the "occult scene"
(as it stands in my view) has undergone a process of am-structuring
and recuperation. All the untidy ends left by the dissection of
the Chaos current have slithered back into place or resumed their
quiet grumblings without further consolidation. Those who rode
the crest of the angry crusade in l987, now find themselves floundering
in uncharted waters, wondering desperately what fore the current
will take next and, more to the point, whether they will be too
washed-up to understand.<P>

What am I talking about?<P>

Well let's face it; the Chaos current is <I>dead</I>. Retrospectively,
it will be extremely difficult to prove it ever actually existed,
other than in the minds of those who caught some brief initial
insight into the writings of Austin Osman Spare. For the rest
of the decade of its existence, the self-labelled Chaos magicians
tried to maintain a dynamic mask for Chaos magic that upon inspection
was seen to be frozen, unpliable and lifeless. The flash of insight
had disappeared and all that remained to fill this void was rabid
polemics and wild disclaimers. To top it all, no one can claim
to have gained reputable knowledge of Spare's work. Chaos magic
has been a long journey over difficult terrain, finally leading
nowhere. In the final analysis, it has not been the hollow posturing
of its High Priests and the half-dozen or so flimsy books that
have meant anything; rather it is the embarrassing admission that
we took it all so seriously at the time. To make this admission
(like a part of any maturing process) takes guts and humour, and
those who haven't yet learnt the small lesson Chaos magic had
to offer will show themselves soon enough by their kicking red-faced
tantrums, gripping for dear life onto its withered corpse.<P>

In one sense the Chaos magicians tried to blow away the 'cult'
aspect ef occultism. The initial movement attempted to concentrate
the bate techniques and systems of magic into a coherent but non-mystical
framework. The burning of the old school tie of magic
seemed a necessary requisite for the pursuit of freer magical
expression- These sentiments were perhaps admirable, but in practice
(for the time-being at least) they have shown that the occult
establishment cannot function without recourse to a necessary
balance between magic and mysticism. In actuality, the reason
why the Chaos movement has burnt-out so quickly is because it
attempted to deny the magic-mysticism formation of <I>cult:</I>
the obsessive <I>belief</I> that produces a basic motive for the
carrying out of magical acts. In trying to create wider expression,
Chaos magicians seem instead to have succeeded in narrowing the
occult arena, exchanging a Path or a way for a selection of spurious
academic considerations. Why this is so remains partly a mystery.
Perhaps, simply it compels the realization that an inherently
understandable <I>belief</I> in the reality of one's magical actions
is necessary. Perhaps, after all, the Chaos magicians were too
optimistic about their own abilities. In any case, the illusion
of "variety" and "selection" of so-called
beliefs, and the eclectic adoption of various magical techniques
<I>resembled</I> a sophisticated synthesis, whereas in actuality
it was a code of systematic devaluation in which all occult doctrine.
however useless or useful, was turned into "data" to be experimented
upon. This is the same error made by scientists testing for Paranormal
phenomena and expecting it to materialise in sterile, clinical
surroundings. Stripping magic of its metaphorical, allegorical
and emotional values renders the would-be Chaos magician relatively
impotent.<P>

Chaos magic was an idea that could never have sustained while
magicians remain human. Books like Liber Null are fine in a strictly
limited sense, but how do you base an order upon a Teaching where
there is no lessen to be learnt?<P>

As an aside here, Pete Carroll recently sent me a copy of the
I.O.T. "training manual" Liber KKK which is concerned
only with engendering "objective proof" by focusing upon
obtaining wealth and business by magic. Nothing wrong with this
of course, but why bother going through tedious "initiation"
rituals when you can mere cheaply obtain a Sorcerer's Apprentice
"money magnet" or "spell kit", or whatever? Surely
that is the "quickest route" (a concern of Mr Carroll's,
so I believe) engendering exactly the same results for these with
the necessary strength to believe. On this subject, it is important
to note that Pete's ex-accomplice, Ray Sherwin, has not made the
same blundering errors of judgement as, for example, offering
prospective I.O.T. members initiation over the phone, and despite
recent criticism and back-lashing, cannot realistically take Pete's
title as Mr. Continual-egg-on-the-face. Seriously, and I trust
he will not take this patronisingly, I have always had a strong
liking for Ray Sherwin and his work, and in recent Chaos International
articles he shows himself to be adaptable and capable. He probably
couldn't care less about my view, but there it is.<P>

Joel Biroco's slant on Chaos magic has also been short-lived and
by my experience of him, transcended - if that's the word. We
can see that this may have been planned, but I suspect he played
it by ear. Perhaps at this moment Mr. Biroco is happily considering
himself the catalyst that destroyed the empty posturing we have
called the Chaos current. A nod to him on that one, but let <I>me</I>
be the first to announce that the Chaos current is OFFICIALLY
DEAD!
