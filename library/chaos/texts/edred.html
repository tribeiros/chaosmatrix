Most people probably think of Chaos Magick as an entirely
postmodern phenomena, a creation of the age of the PC and
VCR. The magical system postulated by Peter Carroll (and
other magical theorists, including Frater U.D.) certainly
resonates with the postmodern state. Instead of a central,
linguistically definable power source such as God, goddess,
or Satan, Chaos magickians look toward an undifferentiated
ether that longs to be formed into substance by the Will of
the magickian -- a power source one might describe as the
Unmanifest longing to be Manifest. Just as the postmodern
thinker does not have exterior textual standards of Truth,
the Chaos magickians has no standard save for praxis. If it
Works, it partakes of the  divine. <P>

Although this concept of a numinous universe in continuous
creation/destruction is "new" to people working under a
Judeo-Christian paradigm, it was common to the more
sophisticated views of our ancestors' ancestors. It is
useful to return to these roots -- not only for the practical
reason of checking on the experimental data that's already
been collected, but for the arcane reason of discovering
what magicks have already effected the evolution of our own
souls. Chaos Magick represents a path that can lead to an
expansion of knowledge and power, not only in the realm of
matter, but in the realm of spirit as well. But all such
expansions require transformation of the Self, and all
transformation requires exact knowledge.<P>

A good place to begin one's Quest for Chaos Magick is in the
<I>Seidhr</I> (approximately pronounced "sayther") practices of
the ancient Germanic peoples. I began my Quest with a talk
with my friend
Edred Thorsson,
founder and Yrmin-Drighten of the Rune-Gild, Grandmaster
of the Order of the Trapezoid of the Temple of Set, at his
academy Woodharrow in the Lost Pines region of Texas --
which is also the location of his press: <P>

<hr>

<B>fwr:</B> What is <I>Seidhr</I> and how is it connected to
the idea of Chaos?<P>

<B>Mr E:</B> Now it is generally imagined that <I>Seidhr</I>
is a kind of evil magic practiced by Norse shamans -- especially
female ones. Indeed, <I>Seidhr</I> is an ancient form of
magic practiced by the Scandinavian peoples at least since
the Viking Age. <I>Seidhr</i> is generally connected with
the Gods and Goddesses, called the Vanir, and especially
with Freyja, whose name is really the title "Lady".<P>

<I>Seidhr</I> is also generally contrasted with another word
for "magic" in the Northern tongue: <i>Galdr</i>. <i>Seidhr</i>
is connected to the concept of "Chaos" in the sense that the
theory upon which <i>Seidhr</i> works is very similar to
that upon which Chaos Magic works. Both are based on a
<i>materialistic paradigm</i> -- what Peter Carroll calls "Ether"
and the ancient Germanic peoples called <i>Ginnung</i>, or
Chaos. This paradigm is, by the way, to be contrasted with
the essentially <i>symbolic</i> theory underlying <i>Galdr</i>
-- a theory which is semiotic and linguistic in character, not
substance-based. The underlying theory of <i>Seidhr</i> is
pretty much the same as "the magical paradigm" described by
Carroll in his <i>Liber Kaos</i>. However, that general
theory does not account for <i>Galdr</i>, which is <i>independent</i>
of the flows of the time/space continuum.<P>

<B>fwr:</B> What is the cosmological model which <i>Seidhr</i>
presupposes? Chaos Magickians represent the relationship
between the ego-portion of the psyche and the rest of the
Cosmos with a circle with eight arrows bursting forth --  an
image copied from the fantasy works of Michael Moorcock. Do
you suspect the resonance of this symbol  to be a
remanifestation of <i>Seidhr</i> practices?<P>

<B>Mr E:</B> Yes, the symbol itself seems to be a noumenal
atavism of the common Germanic cosmological map which is
centered on the "earth" (or <i>ego</i>) and which  radiates
out in a total of eight "directions", only six of which can
even by symbolically "located" in three-dimensional space.
The other two -- <i>Hel</i> (the Realm of the Dead) and
<i>Asgard</i> (the Realm of the Gods and Heroes of Awakened
Intelligence) -- exist in hyper-space at acute angles  to all
the other axes of the map simultaneously. The cosmological
model that is presupposed is that <i>Ginnung</i> is present
in everything. The German scientist Karl Reichenbach coined
the term "Odic Force" -- named after the Norse God Odin -- to
represent this substance.<P>

<B>fwr:</B> Didn't the term <i>Ginnung</i>, or Chaos, come
to mean illusion or delusion? Is it related to the Indian
word <i>Maya</i>? Isn't this supposed to be just plain "bad
stuff"?<P>

<B>Mr E:</B> <i>Ginnung</i> or <i>Ginning</i> becomes a word
for "delusion" at a certain point in Old Norse. One of the
sections of the <i>Prose Edda</i> by Snorri Sturluson is
called the <i>Gylfa-ginning</i>, usually translated "Gylfi's
Delusion". But in the <i>Rig Veda</i> we see that <i>Maya</i>
is the <i>creative power</i> wielded by Varuna, who with his
<i>pashas</i> ["bonds"] can bind or loosen, destroy or create
anything he can imagine. In both cases what we are dealing
with is the idea that this is "powerful stuff" -- and power
can equal mortal danger.  In essence <i>Ginnung</i> is the
undifferentiated energy/matter which preexists creation, and
which underlies the forms of all phenomena. What had been "magical
power" to the trained elite, became "bad ju-ju" as its
practices drifted down to the masses. The amount of training
and discipline necessary to wield <i>Ginnung</i> in a
reliable way is so great that the vast majority of humanity,
when they try to "use" it, simply end up confusing
themselves and devolving into a morass of illusion. Hence
the use of the substance becomes more or less taboo.<P>

<B>fwr:</B> How can the concepts of <i>Ginnung</i> (Chaos)
and <i>Futhark</i> (Order) be creatively synthesized by an
individual to produce the materials of his or her own life?
What barriers are there to a creative synthesis?<P>

<B>Mr E:</B> Well, first of all it must be emphasized that
indeed such a synthesis must take place in order for the
Will of the individual magician to rule. Order is a
relatively rare event, and is one which is anterior to the
existence  of <i>Ginnung</i>. Order is something which is
Willfully  impressed upon, and out of, Chaos. It is the
progressive impression of Order out of Chaos that
characterizes self-development, or Initiation. The chief
barriers to this process are that magicians may reject
(demonize) either the Order or the Chaos, thus un-balancing
themselves, or that they will succumb to the chaotic
material within themselves -- which is by far the predominant
mass of the self -- and begin to mistake the inherent patterns
of the chaos for their <i>own</i> Wills. This latter path defines
a sort of mysticism, but is to be distinguished from magic
because the all-important component of the Will, or
individual consciousness, has been negated. In <i>Seidhr</i>
one <i>temporarily</i> loses consciousness in order to
effect conscious aims -- but unconsciousness is not the aim in
and of itself.<P>

<B>fwr:</B> What mental/spiritual attitudes or moods help
the Magickian to get the best results when dealing with
Chaos?<P>

<B>Mr E:</B> Interestingly enough, the mood of <i>Seidhr</i>
is an extremely serene, tranquil and fearless one. In the
face of psychic turmoil and what most would consider
frightening imagery -- that of darkness, death and even
dismemberment -- the seidh-man or seidh-wife often evidences
moods diametrically opposed to the expected ones. In
<i>Seidhr</i> the worker is often virtually in a state of
suspended animation, and most always in a trance-state of
some kind. But the worker of <i>Seidhr</i> is not a
world-renouncing mystic. <i>Seidhr</i> is a magic of this
world, for gaining effects in this world on the level plane
of existence.<P>

<B>fwr:</B> What would be a practical piece of <i>Seidhr</i>
I could do?<P>

<B>Mr E:</B> With a clear and urgent Need, and with a
precise question, go to a graveyard where one of your family
members is buried. It's better if the person is the most
distant ancestor you can find. Sit on the grave and imagine
yourself descending into the grave, to be with that family
member in Hel -- or at least that part of the person which
remains there. When you have a sense of the presence of the
person, pose the question to him or her -- and listen for the
answer.<P>

From the outside, this could look like a nice visit to the
cemetery, just like they used to do in the "good ol' days".
Yes, but just <i>how old</i>?<P>
