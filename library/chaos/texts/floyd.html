Don asks a really good question:<BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Pardon me for being just a little bit skeptical, but I wonder if folks
on the list seriously believe that they were personally responsible for
directing the path of Floyd?"</BLOCKQUOTE>

I did my part on my own.  I didn't partake in any group ritual, but since
my friend Mary is in Florida, I spoke to the weather and requested, "Not
here.  Not on Mary.  Over there instead."<BR><BR>

I hold three positions simultaneously.<BR><BR>

(1)  Yup.  I moved the hurricane away from Mary and her sister.<BR><BR>

(2)  Jesus Christ, Lauranz!  You really believe that shit?  You stupid
occultists make me sick with your silly superstitons.  C'mon, you CAN'T
influence the weather, and neither can anyone else.<BR><BR>

(3)  I don't know.  I can say that Mary and her sister got rain, but they
didn't get the hurricane.  That's ALL I can say.  I really, genuinely,
honestly don't know if I had anything to do with it or not.<BR><BR>

I prefer to hold position #1, and modify it a bit with position #3.  That
is to say, I adopt a belief, but I do it consciously and with intention
in order to effect a specific purpose.  I am not interested in blind,
stupid, stubborn belief, and the certainty that I am right.  Rather, I
prefer to adopt a belief that I find esthetic and useful, and maintain
the awareness that I am choosing to enjoy taking this position, and that
at the same time I really don't know.<BR><BR>

I would prefer to live in a magickal world.  The Magickal World of Crazy
Hassan's Clearinghouse of Delights pleases me more and expands my mind
and consciousness more than the greyface ordinary world.  So I choose to
work weather and listen to my car talk to me and wave my magick wand and
be an ass-kickin' ol' lady, all the while being aware that this is a
choice I've made, and that I cannot prove anything with any sort of
certainty.<BR><BR>

Love,<BR><BR>

Lauranz
