<H2>EGO &amp; WILL</H2>

<HR>
The concept of the Ego - the psychic structure of self-identifications,
beliefs, desires and personifications is recognised as the basis
of our psychocosm. A curious misconception has arisen that the
Ego is a barrier to magical development - that it is somehow to
be taken down or destroyed before one can advance 'spiritually'.
To some, it seems that while 'Western development' builds up the
ego, 'Eastern approaches' aim at ego-transcendence. There is much
dicussion of the 'higher self' which appears after the ego has
been transcended - this is a common theme in so-called 'New Age'
thought. The psyche however, is not a <I>static</I> entity, and
this kind of 'ego vs higher self' thinking is a carry-over of
the rationalistic mind-body division. Attempts to get rid of the
ego can easily result in one-sided development, fostering both
self-importance and a 'holier-than-thou' attitude. Avoiding the
so-called 'dark' aspect of human desire results in a shallow caricature
of human potentiality, a blandness which avoids plumbing the depths
of the psyche. Clarity of thought, insight, and struggle are glossed
over with a sugar-coating of bliss.<P>

To work with one's ego is to begin an inner alchemy, the aim of
which is not to 'destroy' or 'transcend' it, but to move from
a state of fixation (ego-centric) to a condition of mutability
(Exo-centric), which is capable of constant revision and change.
This is what is meant by the phrase 'letting go', and of dissolving
the idea of mind as separate to the world. The Ego remains as
a point of 'I-ness' which gives meaning to experience, yet the
contents of the psyche become much more fluid.<P>

In one sense, it is the ego which roots us in space-time - the
psychic equivalent of having a sense of place, of occupying a
particular set of co-ordinates. The majority of our experience
of reality is at the level of objects, bodies and events that
appear to be temporally separate. We experience ourselves as centres
of will, perception, and ego.<P>

In contrast to the ego, the will displays a vector quality, in
that it has both direction and magnitude. The will is the wave
to the ego's particle. Although we like to think of ourselves
as centres of intentionality, much of our behaviour is a result
of vector resonance - waves rippling through, appearing in our
space-time universe as separate events and synchronous experiences.
A key to the appropriate magical stance is given by Crowley in
his novel, Moonchild:<P>

"...the clever man, so-called, the man of talent, shuts
out his genius by setting up his conscious will as a positive
entity. The true man of genius deliberately subordinates himself,
reduces himself to a negative and allows his genius to play through
him as it will..."<P>

The Thelemic concept of the realisation of the True Will necessitates
an unfolding of awareness of the will as a vector quality. Will
imposes organisation - order out of "the chaos of the normal"
(Austin Osman Spare), and the realisation of True Will involves
an 'obedience to awareness' of the evolutionary patterns which
govern human development. Will is an emergent property of our
interaction with the total environment - it cannot be isolated
to any one element. Will, perception and consciousness - we are
immersed in them the way a fish is immersed in water. They are
emergent properties of the total biosphere of Gaia.<P>

So much for theory. How is this alchemy accomplished? The key
word is <I>integration</I> - dissolving the mind-body, spirit-matter
fragmentation. Enter into a 'being-in-the-now' dance, immersed
in the body of Gaia, within the universe. Will on any level is
the organising principle - kundalini-shakti coiled creates all
forms. Therefore:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Invoke Often, feeling all magical acts as a passage of Will
    <I>through</I> you.
<LI>Attend to the continual reconstruction of your psychocosm
    through the examination of beliefs, desires and attitudes.
<LI>Seek union with all that you have rejected.
<LI>Practice magick as though your very survival depended on it!
<LI>Forget everything you have been told about the world, assume
    nothing and develop your own path.
<LI>Eat more donuts!<BR>
