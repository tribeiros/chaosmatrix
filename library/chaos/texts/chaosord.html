<H1>Kaos and Order</H1>
<H2>by Persona Navitae 353</H2>

Chaos is often associated with discord, disharmony,
disarray; these aren't considered states in themselves, from
the words we can see that they are thought of as
"unnatural". "Dis" means "absence of, or opposite of" and
implies that they are somehow not the normal state of
affairs. Is this a valid view of chaos?<P>

I differentiate Kaos from chaos to emphasize a different
aspect of kaotic energies, that of pure creativity. In a
sense, discordance isn't an bad definition, but it's from
the wrong perspective. The creative forces are manic. They
focus in as many places as possible, in as many aspects as
possible. A good example is the animal world. Mutations are
the rule, species that don't change, eventually die out.
Dinosaurs, for example, survived, but in radically different
form from their ancestors. We see them everyday, as birds.
They mutated and persevered. The diversity of the animal
speies has led to the continuation of life on Earth.
Diversity does, unfortunently, often lead to competition and
conflict. The more creativity at work, the greater the
eventual discordance. The Kaos forces don't work for discord
though, it's the byproduct of a vital living and growing
system.<P>

I first heard of the creative aspect of chaos from Michael
Moorcocks books. In his "Eternal Champion" universe there
are two primary sets of God/desses, those of Law and those
of Chaos. The Law god/desses get very little attention in
the novels, Moorcocks conception of them is of beings who
basically keep to themselves. The Chaos deities, on the
other hand, are vital and active forces. They are
continually interfering with the affairs of mortals. In
fact, they created the older races, Elfin, and as we later
find out, the younger races, Humans, as well. It's
interesting to note that We aren't told why. The older races
feel that the Chaos God/desses have betrayed them by
creating new races. This is the nature of Chaos, it has no
morality or immorality. The Chaos deities have no specific
plans. The reader is left with the impression that they
aren't working for any particular goals. What is displayed
in Moorcocks books are the pan-fecund powers of pure Chaos,
they change form constantly and the lands they inhabit are
in continual flux; fields of flowers erupting into myriad
flames, fantastic castles continually shifting dimensions.<P>

The one time Moorcock deals with pure Law we are faced with
a lone inhabitant of a grey featureless plane. By the force
of his Will this being had reduced his home to virtual
non-existence. The Eternal Champion kills the being, and the
realm returns to normal. This is somewhat different from the
usual conception of Chaos and Law, I found it very
appealing.<P>

Kaos is creative. I use the "K" both to differentiate it
from simple chaos, and to emphasize the Magickal aspects.
"K" is the eleventh letter in most alphabets, and in Qabalah
it means "palm". The palm is one of the channelers of the
Current, in ancient works; neolithic, Celtic, we see the
Horned God sitting with one hand down and one up. He is
conducting the Earth energies upward and the celestial
energies downward. This is similar to the Tantric practice
of raising Kundalini up from the Muladhara Chakra, the Earth
center, to the Sahasra Chakra, the Celestial center. In
Tantra though, the energies are internalized, they are
raised in the spinal column and brought back down. In the
Shamanic practice the energies are channeled through the
body, but they don't stay in the body. In Kaos Magick these
are both important Magickal works.<P>

The eleventh letter stands for Daath on the tree of life.
This is "knowledge", and the gateway to the City ov the
Pyramids. The Kabbalists considered this to be a cursed
number. They were working for the old God, Yahweh, who would
prefer humanity remain in slavery. Crowley entered thee City
and recounts it in Liber 418. It was there that he heard one
of his true names, Nemo. While there Crowley was told "The
eye is called seventy, and the triple Aleph whereby thou
perceivest it, divided into the number of the terrible world
that is the key of thee Abyss". The triple seventy adds up
to 210, the triple eyes of Ayin, or Set, the Devil card in
the Tarot. It Represents the unification of opposites in
Tantra, the two being -1 and 1, -1+1=0. It is symbolized in
the Ankh, the lower line being the world of plurality, the
bar being the barrier to the greater consciousness or
Metamind, and the circle representing the enlightened being.<P>

The eleventh letter, K, also is important for it's emphasis
on combining the female and male energies. This is part of
the creative process of Universe. Eleven is six and five,
the Elevenstar that Crowley created. Five is the female,
Babalon, the five petalled lotus, the downward pointing
pentagram in the book of Thoth. It moves from the stable
foundation of the four, Earth, to the stable hexagram. It is
a dynamic energy. In Tantra this is Kali, the creative
aspect of Universe, at least as the Alchemists understood it
to be.<P>

The Six and Five unite in the Eleven. The pure creative
energies of Kali crystallizes in the forms of the elements.
Combined, they are the Elevenstar Magicks. As Magickians,
one of our goals is to discern the mysteries and through
Gnosis and Will become creative beings.<P>

The next letter in Kaos is "A", Alpha. The beginning, the
Aces in the Tarot. This is the first step after channeling
the creative energies, to start the magickal Work, and the
goal of the neophyte, to achieve the Great Work, to find the
Grail and through it, remanifest. Omega is thee third
letter, the end. Within Kaos is the beginning, Arche, and
the end, Telos. Kaos is complete in itself, seeded by it's
own will. In the very ancient Goddess creation myths we
often see this parthenogenic process. The Goddess arises
from the Chaos waters and from herself creates the divine
consort, the Serpent. This is the last letter, "S". It is
the Logos, the transmitter of the divine Gnosis. It is
Hermes, Thoth, and Legba. The opener of the way. In the
garden humankind was like the beast. The Serpent, sent as
thee divine messenger gave humanity the Gnosis, or the
knowledge to transform ourselves. This Gnosis is the
knowledge of thee creative process, Magick, and with it we
became more than beasts. We left the garden of our own
accord.<P>

In Physics matter is considered to be in particular energy
states. Take away a certain amount ov energy, and it falls
to a less active, but stable energy state, put energy in and
it moves to a higher specific energy state. Kaos is the
energy, Order is the stable state. From the pure Kaos, the
waters ov Nuit, coums the four God/desses ov Order and
Chaos. Using thee Egyptian cosmos, Set is the ordered Kaos
God, Nepthys the Kaotic Kaos Goddess, Osiris thee Ordered
God ov Order, and Isis the Kaotic Goddess ov Order.<P>

Nepthys is the energy Neter for the creative power. In pure
form her forces is continually reforming, never stable. This
is the raging force of Universe expanding. Through the Dark
Goddess Kaos manifests into thee Matrix formed by Set. Set
creates thee matrix for transformative order, the dynamic
state ov balance always working for a higher state ov being.
Isis is thee patterned Kaos force, the energy ov nature, the
creation ov mutating form. Osiris is thee force ov inertia.
His power is thee tendency for all matter and energy to
resist change.<P>

Thee Priest/esses of Set/Nepthys are those intrepid and
creative people who thrive on new ideas. They are thee
rebels and thee inovators. From them coum thee heretics ov
science and religion, those who seek change for it's own
sake. Thee people who recognize that humanity thrives on
diversity. Thee Priest/esses ov Isis are thee ones seeking
Gnosis ov thee existing Universe. They work on what iz
known, give us a deeper knowledge ov what thee heretics have
discovered. Thee Priest/esses ov Osiris are thee
conservatives. They wish for no change, work only for
greater enslavement. They create thee rules and regulations
that keep humanity from moving forward. In thee middle ages
they were very powerful, in thee New Aeon they have no
place. Inertia is fine for keeping creation at a steady
pace, but no more than that.<P>

Magickians are those few who seek to understand Universe and
work with it. We recognize thee Kaos forces as thee true
source ov Gnosis and through Will we becoum Priest/esses ov
thee Dark Deities who offer them. As we progress from thee
Neophyte to thee Maga/Magus we face thee oppressive forces
ov thee Old Aeon with knowledge, strength, and creativity.
Through these the Kaos forces manifest. Kali, Arcana, Oshun,
Sophia. In Light, Life, Love and Liberty.<P>
