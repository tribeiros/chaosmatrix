<H3>Servitors, Psychodynamics and Models of Magick</H3>

Chaos Magick, at least if approached by through the internet and
conversation with chaos magicians, can appear a sprawling,
contradictory mess of techniques to the newcomer.  The relativistic
stance of Chaos Magick, and it's apparent lack of a unifying
template can appear both morally disturbing and intellectually
frustrating, especially to occultists coming to it from more
traditional paths.  Frater U.D., in a small essay published
in 1991, provided a clearer approach to chaos magick by
declaring it to be a meta-model, a fifth approach to magick.
The other four he defined as the Spirit Model (used by shamans
and traditional ceremonial magicians, in which autonomous
entities exist in a dimension accessible to ours through altered
states of consciousness); the Energy Model (where the world is
viewed as being 'vitalized' by energy currents that the magician
manipulates); the Psychological Model (in which the magician
is seen as "a programmer of symbols and different states of
consciousness," manipulating the the individual and the deep
psyche); and the information model (where information is the
code that programs the essentially neutral energy of the life force).
Frater U.D. points out that writers on chaos magick generally
subscribe to a great extent to the Psychological Model, but,
their approach utilizes a Meta-Model, which is really a set
of instructions on how to use the other models.  One of the most
salient facts about chaos magick, and one of the most difficult
for many newcomers to grasp, is that it is not really a magickal
philosophy at all, it is really a technology, an approach, or
stance towards magickal systems.  The path to this was a result
of chaos magicians developing and then transcending the Psychological
Model. This essay on servitors while discussing many of the practical
issues in the creation and deployment of servitors also elucidates
the relationship between chaos magickal theory and modern psychology.<P>

Modern magicians, chaos magicians, contemporary sorcerers,
and the other magickal users of servitors appear to have adopted
a modified psychodynamic view of personality, and the way in
which we identify ourselves.  This view, first expounded by
Freud and the other founders of psychoanalysis (Jung, Adler, etc.),
suggests that the way in which we view ourselves develops over time,
and motivational syndromes (what we want and how we go about
getting it) are critical to this development.  This is quite a different
view than type or trait personality theories which were in favor
throughout most of Western history  (man is composed of a
compound of four or five elements, for example).  Chaos magicians
tend to display more of a situationist stance to personality,
that is to say they tend to act as though the situation in which
one finds oneself is the dominant factor in observable behaviors.
Chaos magicians also tend to suggest that this is a good thing, since
it means the personality can be used opportunistically, as a tool
to achieve desires.  This stance also reflects Buddhist and Eastern
views of the Self, which either repudiate its existence as a permanent
construction, or state that its essential nature can only be discovered
through profoundly altered states of consciousness (samadhi).<P>

Phil Hine, in his excellent pamphlet "Chaos Servitors, a User Guide"
writes of the self:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I prefer the analogy of the self as an organic city-entity,
where
some portions are more prominent than others, where there are
hidden tunnels and sewers, and where the under levels carry
vital energies to buildings.  The city-self is continually changing
and growing - tear down a building of belief, and another
grows back in its place."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Austin Osman Spare was clearly influenced by psychodynamic
theories of the self, as well as Eastern ones, and the general
magickal theory he passed on to us embody these ideas.
Primarily concerned with  motivation (desire), Spare wrote
in "The Book of Pleasure":<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The 'self' is the 'Neither-Neither,' nothing omitted,
indissoluble,
beyond prepossession; dissociation of conception by its own
invincible love is the only true, safe, and free...This Self-Love
is now declared by me the means of evolving millions of ideas
for pleasure without love, or its synonyms-self-reproach,
sickness, old age, and death.  The Symposium of self and love.
O! Wise Man, Please Thyself."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Note the combination of psychoanalytic vocabulary and
Vedic metaphysics combined with an insistence on motivation
as fundamental.<P>

Now a servitor is generally considered to be a part of the
personality of the magician that has been severed from him.
I would argue that this is a limited view of servitors, that
they could be considered severed portions of the Deep Mind,
and consequently not located in the psyche of any particular
magician.  In my view demons, angels, imaginary friends,
poltergeists and perhaps even ghosts are servitors.  Servitors
can be called thought-forms (as opposed to godforms which
may sometimes be servitors on steroids).<P>

Since contemporary magickal stances to personality are
psychodynamic and motivational servitors tend to be viewed
as functional entities, and rather easily operated.  Contrast
this with the type and trait theories that inform Traditional
Ceremonial Magick.  Magicians up until this century (and
still some today) spend what seems to me ridiculous amounts
of time and effort evoking demons, using grimoires, and
engaging in a paraphernalia of magick that makes a great
deal of sense if you believe in type and trait theories of
personalities, but very little if your approach is situational
and pyschodynamic.  If you believe that a demon you summon
is a wholly independent entity with a personality type all
of its own you may have to resort to extreme measures
to force it to do your bidding.  If you believe that a demon is
a servitor summoned as a manifestation of your desire
then a simple bargain will suffice (I'll give you energy, you
get what I want, I'll give you a nice place to live).<P>

<HR><P>

<H3>What is a Servitor?</H3>

Motivational syndromes (desire) are fundamental to Spare's
form of magick, hence the name of his most popular book,
"The Book of Pleasure."  Spare and magicians, Chaos or otherwise,
have adopted the Jungian expansion of Freud's theory of the
Unconscious.  Jung theorized the existence of a collective unconscious,
shared by all.  He considered it to be transpersonal and the
residue of the evolution of humankind.  I  personally prefer
Jan Fries' term, the Deep Mind, but it comes  to much the same
thing. Spare, who called the collective unconscious the
sub-consciousness characterized it as follows:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Know the sub-consciousness to be an epitome of all experiences
and wisdom, past incarnations as men, animals, birds, vegetable life, etc.
,
etc.,  everything that exists, has and ever will exist."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Both Spare and Peter Carroll attempted to develop a technical
vocabulary to describe the phenomena and techniques of the
type of magick posited by Spare.  Carroll, both FireClown and I believe,
was trying to construct a vocabulary that could be used by magicians
of any type.  FireClown calls this a "discussional template", or a
way in which, for example, thelemites could talk to wiccans without
misunderstanding each other.  Unfortunately Carroll's use of the
hierarchical gambit resulted in this vocabulary becoming
exclusionary.<P>

A fine example of this is the term "servitor."  The time predates
Chaos Magick and can be found to refer to bound spirits in the
fiction of Clark Ashton Smith, who was writing for Weird Tales
in the 1930s.  Servitor is actually a word referring to entities
that actualize through evocation, a magickal technique as old as
magick itself.  Carroll writes<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"These beings have a legion of names drawn from the demonology
of many cultures: elementals, familiars, incubi, succubi, bud-wills,
demons, atavisms, wraiths, spirits, and so on."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Spare seems to indicate that these entities are bound to obsessions,
that is to say the magician, experiencing an obsession (a way the
psyche tells the magician that it desires something), forms part
of the sub-consciousness into a semi-independent phenomenon
that will do the work needed to actualize the magician's desire.
Carroll disagrees somewhat, although he allows that such beings have
their origin in the human mind.  Phil Hine whose interest in
his User's Guide to Servitors is the creation of such beings
writes:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"By deliberately budding off portions of  our  psyche and
identifying
them by means of a name, trait, symbol, we can come to work with
them (and understand how they affect us) at a conscious
level."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

So at least in the type of magick developed by Spare, Carroll,
and Phil Hine, a servitor  is a part of the magician's psyche, or a
part of the Deep Mind that the magician evokes to perform a task.
Do these entities have an existence prior to their evocation?  Perhaps.
Magick is trans-temporal, trans-spatial.  If the Deep Mind contains all
experience that has been or ever will be then the question is meaningless,
or as Blake wrote:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Everything that can be Believed is an Image of the
Truth."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I do think that the use of servitors is widespread among many
people who would not dream of considering themselves
magicians.  People personalize their cars, have imaginary
friends as children, or give personalities to their toys,
carry objects they consider to be "lucky" with them or
allow their obsessions to absorb their personalities so they
turn into demons.  Many  movies deal with servitors,
Natural Born Killers being an obvious example, Tetsudo,
a fine Japanese flick being an even more obvious example.
In NBK the demons are eventually reintegrated and the
two killers stop killing.   The fine film Seven is essentially
a magickal ritual in which the murderer uses people as the
material bases for servitors, in this case representing the demons
of the Seven Deadly Sins.<P>

To my mind these are all examples of  the use of servitors
because they follow Hine's simple definition of servitors as
budded off portions of the psyche or personality
developed for a simple or complex purpose which gain a
semi-independent existence.  Of course in the case of demons
absorbing the personality the act is hardly adaptive, although
it may have started out that way.<P>

I'll tell you a story.  I had a friend about 12 years ago, a charming,
handsome young man, intelligent, athletic, and sober.  He used
to baby-sit another friend's teenage daughter.  It turned out
that he was a serial rapist.  He would stalk women, rape them, and
beat them nearly to death.  He got caught because he fell asleep
in his car outside his last victim's apartment and was found by the police
covered with his victim's blood.  I have no doubt he would  have
ended up murdering his future victims.  Fortunately he is unlikely
to ever have that chance.<P>

Now what I think had happened with this man was that, perhaps
as a result of some inability to integrate his rage towards women,
he budded off a part of his personality, the violent, woman hating
part, which became a demon, a semi-independent servitor.
When his obsession was triggered it activated the demon which then
completely possessed him and he became an utterly different person.
For all I know he wasn't even conscious of the demon himself.<P>

None of his friends ever saw this demon, didn't even have a glimpse,
but his victims surely did.<P>

<HR><P>

<H3>Creating Servitors</H3>

Modern magicians have expanded on Jungian ideas of the collective
unconscious to assert that magick occurs within what Spare calls the
sub-consciousness, and Fries the Deep Mind.  Servitors are semi-autonomous
beings that are summoned from the Deep Mind and charged with the per-
formance of  some magickal task.  Stephen Mace, in his monograph
Stealing the Fire from Heaven, calls this sorcery.  He defines it:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Sorcery is the art of capturing spirits and training them to
work
in harness, of sorting out the powers in our minds so we might
manipulate them and make them cause changes both within our
minds and beyond them."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Most writers are unanimous in their opinion that the magician
must develop a clear statement of intent before proceeding in
acts of magick, which presupposes the magician understanding
the nature of their original desire.  In many cases there is simply
no need to create a servitor.  A simple spell might suffice, a desire
sigilized and cast into the Deep Mind in a state of vacuity.
Summoning servitors for the sake of psychic adventure might
also be ill advised, although, judging from the grimoires of
medieval literature in the absence of television it was a popular
way to pass the tedium of an evening.  Teenage satinists (so called
in tribute to their innovative spelling) are also apparently fond
of this sport.  Chaos magicians, it is to be hoped, and the readers
of this essay, would create servitors for more practical reasons.<P>

If the magician does not believe the desire can be actualized by
sigilizing, either because of lack of success in the past, the
inability of the sorcerer to forget the desire, or because the task
is repetitive, or complex then a servitor may be appropriate.
Servitors can be used for finding rare books, for developing
sales in business, for aiding in gaining employment, for irritating
an enemy, for protecting a house, for, really, any number of
jobs.  Servitors can also be used to aid in the deconstruction
and reconstruction of a magician's personality.  On the zee-list
servitors have been described that compress and expand time,
that attack spam mailers, that assist in speedy passage through
rush hour and that are soldiers in magickal wars.<P>

I suggested above that the use of servitors is widespread
throughout humankind.  Magicians and sorcerers, however,
consciously create servitors, extruding them from their own
psyches for specific magickal purposes.  Most people create
servitors unconsciously.  Sometimes, as I recounted,
this can have poisonous results both for the creator of the
servitor and for society.  Servitors that contain elements of
personality that the sorcerer finds maladaptive are usually
known as demons.  Mace writes in regards to demons:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Demons: reflexes that generate uncontrollable moods,
fantasies, and even actions.  Demons are often acquired as
a response to a twisted environment that had to be endured
during the weakness and dependence of childhood.  The adult,
empowered wizard will realize they are inappropriate to his
current situation, and make every effort to bind them so
they will no longer bother him."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

In fact bound demons can be quite useful.<P>

Since many servitors are available for use by the magician
through grimoires, or the use of elementals, sylphs,
incubi, and the like, it might be reasonably inquired why the
sorcerer should go to the trouble of creating one.  Mace
answers this:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"there's a problem with using preexisting spirits.  They
invariably come equipped with enormous amounts of
moral and theological baggage, bundles of belief and
righteousness that you must carry with you as you make
your way through the world."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I suggest readers who question this use a grimoire to evoke a
lesser demon  like Belphegor (not an archdemon like Belial),
visit a channeller, or a medium for a seance.  Apart from
entertainment value I  doubt that  the reader will experience
significant or lasting change from these experiences.  Belphegor,
I should note, has been credited with assuring regular bowel
movements, so perhaps he might have a lasting effect on constipated
mages. Apart from this possible exception, creating a servitor and charging
it with a magickal task can have a profound effect on a sorcerer's life.<P>

This is why a fairly rigorous intellectual analysis of the desire
of the sorcerer should be undertaken before evocation.  The
magician can use any number of techniques to do this, but the
discussion of the magickal intent with other sorcerers is
probably the most helpful.  This is especially true when the
servitor to be created is to effect a change in the personality
of the magician since it is very possible that excising an
apparent vice may also remove an intertwined virtue
leaving the sorcerer weaker and poorer than before.<P>

Once the magickal intent has been determined and the magician
is fairly sure that no unwitting damage to the psyche will
ensue, then the actual process of creating a servitor can
begin.<P>

Servitors can be easily divided into two classes, those that come
from identifiable areas of the magician's psyche, and those that
issue forth from the deeper levels of the subconsciousness ( and
hence may not be recognizable to the magician as deriving from
a property of the sorcerer's psyche).  If, for example I create a
servitor to afflict an enemy this can be easily seen to originate
in my own rage.  On the other hand, if I summon an elemental
because I want rain this spirit may have no apparent connection
with my own psyche.  Of course it does, but perhaps at such a
deep level that it is held in common by many others.  Ghosts are
another example of beings that issue forth from deep levels of
the subconsciousness and are often perceived in very similar ways
by different people.  Whether the sorcerer creates a servitor from
scratch, as it were, or summons a preexistent spirit may depend on
the task to which the servitor is put.  Servitors may also be created
which have components of both the individual magician's psyche
and of the Deep Mind.<P>

I'm in business for myself and my business depends on the
timely receipt of payments. I'm in the process of creating a servitor to
facilitate payments made to me through the mail.  The servitor
I imagine to look like Zippy the U.S.P.S. mascot but carrying a
large hand gun - Zippy the psychotic Postal Worker.
He will be charged with the specific job of speeding up my mail,
particularly checks to me.  Of course, part of Psycho Zippy is budded off
from my own personality and includes my frustration with the mail,
my anxiety over money, my dislike of bureaucrats, and my own
violent tendencies.  Part of Psycho Zippy, though, comes from the
good work of the USPS's advertising staff who imbedded this
image in the American consciousness and the American media that
publicized the mass murders of numerous postal workers by their
coworkers over the last few years.  Psycho Zippy is a hybrid servitor
in this sense, and so will derive its energy from both sources.
Psycho Zippy may also be considered a bound demon, since he
derives from obsessive (and maladaptive) elements of my own
psychology which have been extruded and harnessed to perform
a particular role.  The development of this servitor is useful therapy
since it frees me from these maladaptive elements.<P>

So let's review the process of creating a servitor like Psycho Zippy.
First I become conscious of obsession, manifesting as a repeating
pattern of anxious thoughts about payments which I know have
been mailed but which for reasons quite beyond my ability to understand
take a random number of days to reach me.  This obsession clearly
indicates a desire...I want my payments in a timely and consistent
fashion.  Now I could do a sigil to actualize this desire, but the problem
is persistent and I doubt that a sigil done once will be enough to
solve it.  I could also use a godform, like Ganesh, or Hermes, or Legba or
even Nyarlathotep, but I've tried this and the gods seem fairly fickle
about it, and, in any case, I keep having to go back to them to
 bargain with them every time a payment gets lost.  I have concluded
that a servitor, charged by my own obsession, is the most appropriate
magickal response.<P>

Now in my case the USPS's admen have come up with a sigil that
I only have to modify by adding a large hand gun.  For many servitors,
however, it may be necessary to develop them from scratch by
first forming your magickal intention into a sigil and then using
your imagination to turn this sigil into the shape of servitor (which
can be anything you consider appropriate to the task at hand).  This
process is greatly facilitated if you have developed a magickal
alphabet that contains in sigil form the properties of your personality
and the powers of your mind.  Automatic drawing, a common way
to develop this type of alphabet, can also be used to develop the shape
of the servitor.  These alphabets are also known as alphabets of desire.<P>

On Alphabets of Desire Mace writes:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Each letter (actually an ideograph) represents a power...an
unconscious
structure or variety of energy that the sorcerer recognizes or wishes to
recognize within his deep psyche."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

In essence the sorcerer sigilizes a desire and then uses automatic
drawing until an ideograph is created that is, as Mace says, "perfectly
apropos." Letters from this alphabet can be combined to form
the shape of a servitor, again using techniques of automatic drawing.<P>

An alphabet of desire is a set of personal magickal symbols
that describe or trigger certain powers of the mind or
aspects of the sorcerer's personality.  Although the AoD
is generally considered to be graphical there isn't any
reason it can't be gestural, or a set of sounds, or a
group of familiar emotional states or states of consciousness.
The construction of an alphabet of desire also does not need
to be nearly as formal as suggested by Spare, Carroll, Phil Hine,
Jan Fries, Stephen Mace and others.  It can develop organically
as a result of, for example, repetitive gestures or sounds
a sorcerer makes in rituals.  Moreover, it is not necessary
for the sorcerer to be able to define the elements of
the AoD outside of the ritual space. The conscious mind does
not have to know the meanings and attributions of the
alphabet since the sorcerer uses it in an altered state of
consciousness induced by ritual.<P>

FireClown and I, who have similar varieties of magick,
actually don't have much of a conscious understanding of
our personal alphabets of desire, which are linked
more to repetitive gestures, sounds, and subtle states
of consciousness rather than graphic symbols.<P>

Although most sorcerers working in the tradition of AOSpare
are indebted to the theoretical structure he developed,
slavish adherence to Spare's techniques would be quite
contrary to what Spare himself would have wanted.<P>

Of course, if you want to create servitors from graphical
sigils then an iconic alphabet of desire will certainly help.<P>

The impetus to begin writing this much postponed essay was prompted
 by  a question from a member of the zee-list, a list for the use of the
z(cluster), a loose international association of chaos magicians,
ontological  anarchists, and the like, primarily mediated through the
internet.<P>

A listmember posted the following question:<P>

<XMP>
>In my work with sigilizing desire, I have frequently come
>across strange beings which seem related to the sigils. Sometimes,
>these beings have names and its gematrias are relevant to the object
>of desire. What are these beings? Can I create servitors out of them?
</XMP>
<P>

As the reader will have probably gathered, the original question
that precipitated this essay has now been answered.  In sigilizing desires
the magician inadvertently encountered servitors that were in some way
born from these sigils.  The magician now needs to discover what these
servitors are, what their relationship is to the Deep Mind and how they can
be used.<P>

Other relevant questions relating to servitors concern servitor dependency
and using a bound demon's energy to reinforce personality elements that the
magician wants to strengthen.  I'll deal with these questions as this
essay continues.<P>

In creating servitors, once the magickal intention has been formulated an
appropriate container for it can be developed.  This can be a sigilized
figure, an amulet or talisman, a fetish, a computer program or script,
or even,  possibly, an electronic pet. I advise  against using living
creatures as  containers for servitors, partly because of their complexity,
and partly  because it is done all too often by parents wih their children,
owners with  their pets and bosses with their employees, to mention just
a few cases where  human beings extrude parts of their own psyches and
attempt to ram them into  other human beings. Manchurian
candidates notwithstanding most attempts to do  this are qualified
failures. Animal familiars, such as cats, are arguably  not servitors at
all,
but rather, associates of the magician or witch, voluntarily participating
in magickal work.<P>

There is some argument that a material base for a servitor
may not be necessary, but, as Phil Hine points out:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"It does help to further construct the Servitor's persona
as an individual entity, and is also useful for focusing
on when you are recalling the Servitor for reabsorption
or reprogramming."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Let's return to my Psycho-Zippy servitor.  Zippy-with-a-gun
is designed to speed checks written to me through the
U.S.Postal Service.  I do not need to time limit the
existence of this servitor since the problem is evidently
continuous.  I have decided that Zippy-with-a-
gun should have a specific aetheric shape, which will be
attached to a material link.  This link will be an
envelope with Psycho-Zippy's icon in the place of a
stamp.  The envelope will be addressed to me and will
contain a check payable to me for as much money as I
want and signed by the Universe. This envelope talisman
will live on my altar and will also be a resting place
for Psycho-Zippy when he's not out terrorizing postal
and U.P.S. employees into sending me my checks.  I've
also developed a list of instructions for Psycho-Zippy
constraining him to this one task, of facilitating
payments through the mail.  I don't, obviously, want
Psycho-Zippy infecting a postal worker with the notion
that murdering as many of his coworkers as possible
before blowing his own brains out would be a fine way
to spend the day.<P>

These are the preliminary tasks that need to be done
before launching the servitor.  Phil Hine suggests a
servitor design checklist including deciding general
and specific intents; sigilizing the initial desire;
deciding whether time factor, material link, name, or
a specific shape is needed; deciding what will happen
when the task is completed; and, finally, making a
list of instructions.<P>

Again this is a fairly formalistic approach to developing
servitors, and I have to admit that most of the time
I use servitors that are nameless, have no particular
shape, no material link, and are created almost
instantaneously for a specific purpose.  Over a period
of time these servitors have taken on personalities,
or at least the shadows of such, if I use them repetitively.
I have a few of them I send out to speed me through
traffic jams.  I have another that gets me tables in
crowded restaurants before I walk through the door.
I didn't develop these beings, but as a result of
repeating spells (through gesture and sound) to achieve
these results the servitors just seemed to develop
of their own accord.  Since I don't banish servitors
but house them when their tasks are completed I think
I have a pack of shiftless, and probably loutish servitors
hanging around my aetheric environment who leap into
action when I need them. My demons need work.<P>

<H3>Launching Servitors</H3>

<B>Banishing Rituals</B><P>

Almost all modern authors strongly recommend the use
of Banishing Rituals prior to engaging in any magickal
ritual.  The word "banishing" in this concept is something
of a misnomer since the purpose of this technique is to center
the magician within a sacred space, banishing negative influences
being a secondary effect of a banishing ritual.<P>

Uncle Al (Aleister Crowley) writes:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The first task of the magician in every ceremony is therefore
to render his circle absolutely impregnable...If you leave
even a single spirit within the circle, the effect of the conjuration
will be entirely absorbed by it."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Now that's certainly definite enough.  And a wonderful
declamatory  statement it is!  <P>

Crowley's banishing rituals include The Star Ruby (Liber XXV)
and The Star Sapphire (Liber XXXVI), although he assumes
that his readers have an understanding of the most famous
banishing ritual, the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram
(LBRP). One of the clearest descriptions of this can be found in
Donald Michael Kraig's "Modern Magick."  The LBRP and its
derivatives involve invoking godforms or angels at the
corners of the compass as protective agents.<P>

Chaos Magicians, such as Peter Carroll, Phil Hine and Stephen
Mace, also strongly suggest the use of banishing rituals, although their
centering techniques are somewhat simpler.  Phil Hine suggests
that banishing rituals are necessary because they allow entry
into altered states of consciousness, they dispel psychic debris,
and the act to order the universe symbolically, allowing the
magician to stand at the axis mundi.  Peter Carroll writes that a
well cosntructed banishing ritual enables the magician to:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"resist obsession  if problems are encountered with dream
experiences or with sigils becoming conscious."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

By the latter Carroll clearly is referring to the inadvertent creation
of servitors through sigil techniques.  It also has the advantage
of having a basis in Spare's theory of magick and the
transformation of obsessional energy into organic energy.<P>

Carroll, Hine and Mace all suggest magicians develop a glowing
magickal barrier around them when engaged in ritual.  Carroll
and the IOT used the Gnostic Pentagram Ritual(GPR), a
deconstruction of the LBRP, in magickal work.<P>

Curiously I have not been able to discover if Austin Osman Spare
used banishing rituals.  The omission of such from his
"Book of Pleasure" may quite likely be deliberate since he was
certainly aware of them.  I would suggest that Spare may have
considered banishing rituals contrary to the free flow of magickal
symbolism from the Deep Mind to the magician's psyche, that is to say
an artifact that may not be useful.  But Spare's magick, to this day,
remains more radical, more controversial, and more audacious
than most practiced by modern magicians.<P>

Is banishing actually necessary?  I do it in an abbreviated form,
singing the vowels (Eeh-Aye-Aah-Oh-Uuh-Uuh-Oh-Aah-Aye
Eeh) in a scale down and up while following, generally, the
chakras with hand movements.  I do it because I feel better
after I do.  Other magicians I know don't banish at all, while
others won't leave their house without doing an LBRP.  My
banishing ritual takes a few seconds, can be done with groups,
and is a deconstruction of the GPR.  I also tend to use drumming,
incense, and the strange sound of a Nepali tiger thigh flute to set the
scene and move myself into an altered, magickal state of
consciousness.  I also use the LBRP, but almost never for
private ritual.  In public rituals, especially before audiences
who may never have seen Ceremonial Magick before, the
LBRP has a comforting, a soothing effect.  After all, it does
contain the end of the Lord's Prayer and it does call the Archangels.
I don't usually disturb such people with the fact that
Demons  are sometimes classified as Angels by another name.<P>

But if the aim of banishing  is to create a sacred space and center
the magician then perhaps this can be done just with a
hand gesture, with a slight shift in consciousness, or perhaps
a declaration like Jean Luc Picard's "Make It So"!<P>

Modern magickal writers, to my mind, seem terribly concerned
over the sanity and well being of new or neophyte magicians.
I'm not sure if this is motivated by fear of litigation, higher
primate hierarchical motives, or genuine  concern that
new magicians will actually go crazy.<P>

My suggestion is try it both ways.  Do rituals without banishing
and do rituals with banishing.  Then do what you prefer.
After all, if you get infected by some strange denizen of
the Deep Mind because you didn't bother to banish, you could
always ask one of us to exorcise it.  There's always a hearty
welcome at my house for demonic entities!  I like them.
I like to make them work for me, and I like to eat them.
They always have a choice, and demon heart is a lot tastier
than angel heart!<P>

<B>Free Belief and Vacuity</B><P>

A technique explored by AO Spare and discussed at length by Stephen
Mace but strangely absent from many other discussions of Chaos
Magickal techniques  is the state of mind called Free Belief by Mace, and
generally referred to by Spare as the Neither-Neither principle.<P>

Spare wrote:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"When the mind is nonplused capability to attempt the
impossible
becomes known."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Spare's magickal approach is reductionist.  He wrote:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Magic, the reduction of properties to simplicity, making them
transmutable to utilize them afresh by direction, without capitalization,
bearing fruit many times."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Spare believed that acts of magick were most likely to succeed when
the mind had attained a state in which duality had been extinguished
through a process in which dualistic notions were systematically
eliminated by counterpoising them against each other.  He called this
the Neither-Neither principle.  Students of Yogic techniques will
recognize this as the Neti-Neti meditation, a meditation in which the
seeker questions his or her self-identity by discounting all that he
or she is not.  For example:<P>

I am not my name.<BR>
I am not my body.<BR>
I am not my genetic structure.<BR>
I am not my mind<BR>
etc., etc.<P>

Mace gives a simple method for applying Spare's technique:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"To apply this principle to conjuring, wait until you are
absolutely
positive something is true, then search for its opposite.  When
you find it, oppose it to your 'truth" and let them annihilate one
another as well they may.  Any residue you should oppose to its
opposite until your truth has been dismembered and the passion
behind it converted into undirected energy-free belief."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

FireClown explains this in another way.  According to his theory
on the formation of entities, obsession naturally creates thought
forms which soon achieve a form of independence and turn into
demons.  Now demons, and semi-detached parts of the magician's
psyche in general, do not wish to be re-assimilated, or destroyed.
Consequently they will seek energy from any source in the
magician's psyche, but primarily from long running maladaptive
sub-programs such as resentment towards one's parents, one's spouse,
or ex-spouse, feelings of inferiority, or whatever tape loops
are recurrent in the magician's psyche. The generation of free belief
presents the magician with a source of psychic energy, originating
in obsession, that allows the actualization of magickal intentions.
Without generating free belief the energy the magician summons
is eaten by demons and used by them for their own self-perpetuation.
Consequently the magickal act fails.<P>

Spare wrote:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"When by the wish to believe-it is of necessity incompatible
with
an existing belief and is not realized through the inhibition of
the organic belief-the negation of the wish, faith moves no mountains,
not till it has removed itself."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Or, if wishes were horses beggars would ride.  Mere wishing is
rarely sufficient if obsessional energy is at play.  Simple spells,
such as those used to get a table at a crowded restaurant, can
succeed because of their simplicity, and because obsessional
energy has not created demonic entities.<P>

The bar against success in magick is the contradictory opinions the
magician holds of his or her capacity to succeed.  Spare suggests
that this very process can be used by the magician to create a
state of mind in which magick will work. Correct use of the Neither-
Neither principle brings about the state Spare calls Vacuity,
which is, as T.S.Eliot suggests, is <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"A state of complete simplicity<BR>
Costing not less than everything."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

To return to servitors, then, once the servitor has been developed,
and a banishing ritual performed, the magician must achieve a state
of vacuity, a state in which free belief exists.  One way to
achieve this is the Neither-Neither.  As Mace writes:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"By applying the Neither-Neither we can gut the meaningless
convictions that obsess us every day and use the power released
to cause the changes we desire."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Peter Carroll calls this state of vacuity Gnosis.  He wrote<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Methods of achieving gnosis can be divided into two types.
In the inhibitory mode, the mind is progressively silenced
until only a single object of concentration remains.  In the
excitatory mode, the mind is raised to a very high pitch of excitement
while concentration on the objective is maintained.  Strong
stimulation eventually elicits a reflex inhibition and
paralyzes all but the most central function-the object of
concentration.  Thus strong inhibition and strong excitation
end up creating the same effect-the one-pointed consciousness,
or gnosis."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The Neither-Neither technique is primarily inhibitory, although,
through the artificial manipulation of emotional states
attached to obsessive energy there is no reason why the
method could not produce an excitatory effect.<P>

Achieving this state ensures that the servitor can be charged.
Not achieving this state runs the risk that the care the
magician has put into developing the servitor will come to
nothing because the energy developed will end up feeding
the magician's unbound and perhaps unknown demons.<P>

To continue with the example of the Psycho Zippy servitor I
am creating to facilitate payments through U.P.S. and the
Postal Service, I can create free belief by choosing a
recurring tape from my own psyche. I know, for example, I
still resent my father for sending me away to school in
England.  I believe he did it because he was jealous of
my mother's affection for me.  I can counterpoint this
belief by reminding myself that sending me to boarding school
was not only very expensive for him but that he believed
he was affording me an education that he had been denied
due to the poverty of his parents.  On the other hand I
truly hated the institutionalized cruelty of English
boarding school.  I can counterpoint this with the fact that
when I was old enough to enumerate the problems with
the type of school to which he had sent me he removed me
at once and placed in a school that was actually enlightened.
I can continue in this way counterpoising one belief with
a contrary argument until finally I am left with nothing
to which the obsessive resentment can attach.  At this point
I am ready to charge the servitor.  I have moved myself to a
calm and one-pointed state of mind that is nevertheless
suffused with psychic energy.<P>

<B>The Actual Launch</B><P>

To recapitulate:  I have created a sacred space by means of
a banishing ritual.  I have created the appropriate energy
to charge the servitor by using the method of Free Belief.
I am in a state of vacuity. At this point I can bring the
image of Psycho Zippy to my mind and create it as a living
form.  I can visualize it racing, wraithlike, through the
information systems of UPS and the US Postal Service.  I can
visualize it making the hands of postal workers touching my mail
move just a bit faster, see it increasing their concentration
and visual acuity, revving up their hand-eye-body coordination
for the apparently arduous task of getting my checks back to me
on time.  I can then dispatch the servitor into the aether
with a stern admonition to do my will or suffer the consequence
of psychic dissolution.<P>

In actual fact I did none of these things.  Instead I hosted
a ritual, an invocation of Baron Samedi, and before the
invocation, but after the banishing, had the participants gaze
at my rendering of Psycho Zippy.  I then gave this rendering
to a friend who was off to a Fire Performance Art that evening,
but was unable to stay for the invocation. She had the rendering
burned with a flame-thrower while a large group of onlookers chanted
"Zippy, Zippy, Zippy."<P>

A few days later I turned my rendering of Zippy into labels
which I have since placed in every package I ship.  Zippy has, by
and large, worked very well since then, and I would estimate that
the speed of return payments has increased by about 30 per cent.<P>

Zippy is a servitor with a material base, the laser printed
image of him that sits on my alter and is reproduced on my labels.
Although it is by no means necessary for servitors to have material
bases, in this case, it seemed appropriate.  Phil Hine in his
User's Guide gives as examples of material bases:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"rings, bottles, crystals, or a small metal
figurine"</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

In a way Zippy can be termed a fetish servitor. I believe the image
I have drawn of him to have magickal power, thus fulfilling the
definition of fetish.<P>

To give you another example of a fetish servitor, FireClown, who was
having difficulty during job interviews, developed a bear servitor,
which he created with a material base made out of wood.  It looked
something like a wood carved zuni bear.  FireClown wore this amulet
within his shirt during job interviews.  He visualized the bear
as a large, somewhat comical, somewhat threatening, form dancing
behind him as he sat before his interviewers.  He reported that
his prospective employers became quite confused during the interviews,
ceasing to pay attention to him, and frequently glancing behind
him. His interviews were concluded rapidly and cordially and he shortly
found  himself employed.<P>

Phil Hine also suggests that time is a factor to be considered in
servitor design and creation, and suggests that the life cycle or
periodicity of a servitor be included in its creation.  I have not
found this to be the case in my own work, but then this may just be
because I tend to create servitors for perennial needs and use sigils
or godforms for ad hoc situations where I must respond rapidly to
a crisis or momentary desire.<P>

Hine suggests a technique that my local Chaos group -the TAZ, New
Orleans node of the Z(cluster)-has used successfully.  He calls it
"The Airburst Exercise."  In this technique for launching spells,
including group sigils and servitors the participants in the ritual
first develop an altered state of consciousness through whatever
means they choose - chanting, breathing, group groping...whatever.
They then visualize energy flowing to and from each other and
finally crystallizing in a sphere within their circle.  They
visualize the sigil or servitor within the sphere. This sphere
is then launched into the aether (perhaps after a countdown).<P>

The TAZ, New Orleans group, in 1993, decided to celebrate Mardi Gras
into perpetuity by launching a chaos satellite, which they named the
Zerbat.  This satellite was sent into geosynchronous orbit 30 miles
above the spire of St. Louis Cathedral shortly before Mardi Gras
of that year.  The group visualized the satellite as a chaosphere
with a top hat, smoking a cigar.  On Mardi Gras Day since then
members have distributed Reichian orgone collectors throughout
the French Quarter, and, at 6 pm discharged these collectors to
the Zerbat satellite through a group ritual performed in Jackson
Square.  The orgones are visualized as a stream of energy containing
the revelry of Fat Tuesday in the Vieux Carre.  The Zerbat send these
streams of orgiastic energy to other satellites launched around
the world by other groups.  The energy is then received by magicians
using satellite receivers (either images of such, old hubcaps, metal
bowls or, for the brave, their computers) who use the orgones for their
own magickal works.  The Zerbat is, of course, a group servitor
and was launched using a variation of Hine's Airburst Exercise.<P>

<B>Other Methods to Launch Servitors</B><P>

Stephen Mace, in his "Stealing the Fire from Heaven", refers to
another form of servitor, known as "The Magickal Child".  This is
a technique described at length by Crowley (and forms the central
theme of his turgid work of fiction "Moonchild") in which a couple
of magicians have intercourse to produce <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"an astral being whose power is devoted to carrying out the
purpose
of the participants.  It is empowered by the white heat of orgasm
and embodied in the 'elixer' generated by intercourse.  The participants
must give this child a name in advance and also agree on its astral
appearance, for it must fill their imaginations throughout the rite,
until climax sets it in their mingled fluids."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Mace continues with the usual thelemic caveat:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Any loss of concentration upon it or independent thinking
during copulation can be deadly, for then their child will be
monster.  The two participants must therefore agree on the symbolism
they will use, making this formula much more relevant to
traditional magick, where common imagery is easy to come
by."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I can't help but ask what, in these days of protected sex, one must
actually do to "mingle fluids", but perhaps we shouldn't go there.  It
does occur to me that this ritual is not too far removed from normal
intercourse between would be parents anxious to conceive.  Mace states
that this is a heterosexual ritual, but I can see no reason why it
would not be quite as effective, and, in the long run, probably a great
deal less stressful to society as a whole, if it were not a same sex
rite. After all, if the heterosexual couple does not use protection
and a child is the issue of the ritual, the result might be an actual
monstrous child, rather than a servitor.  Oh, the puzzles entrenched
in thelemic logic!<P>

Possibly safer for all concerned by far is the ritual described by Mace
that
Austin Osman Spare used to create servitors, which he and Mace call,
creating some confusion, "elementals".<P>

Mace describes a technique he asserts that Spare used called "The
Earthenware Virgin."  This is a clay vessel with an opening that
fits snugly around the  sorcerer's erect penis and  into which
he masturbates. At the bottom of the vessel is a sigil incorporating
the attributes of the servitor.  Needless to  say this is a technique for
male magicians, although I am certain that inventive  female
magicians could develop effective variations. On orgasm the magician
charges the sigil and then buries it, doing the whole operation during
the quarter moon (ask Mrs. Patterson why!)<P>

Mace continues:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"When the moon passes full, the wizard digs up this clay womb,
replenishes the sperm and -'while repeating suitable incantations'-
pours it out as a libation on the ground.  Then he reburies the
urn."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Sounds pretty raunchy to me, rather like a pornographic Clark Ashton
Smith story.  Does the sorcerer clean the vessel before ejaculating into it
a second time, or does the grit add an ascetic tinge to the operation?<P>

In any event Mace states<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Spare cautions that though this technique never fails, it is
dangerous,
and so he leaves much to be guessed."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Rather too much in my opinion.  What if the sorcerer gets the dimensions
a little wrong?  What if the sorcerer has been using Viagra?  Will he get
stuck?  Then what?  Never mind.  Back to Mace:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"...one may suppose that the urn acts as a clay womb in which
the wizard breeds a familiar spirit.  Such help can be as risky as it is
effective, however, for if the wizard is in any way unable to control
himself, he will have an even harder time managing a semi-independent power
such as this.  He must always keep the initiative over it, never allow it
any scope for independent action, and always maintain a strict separation
between its form and his own.  He must <U>never</U> invite it into
himself."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Mace underlines "never."<P>

This curious tendency among magicians from all traditions to warn of
the dangers of magickal operations may be no more than stagecraft
("Kids, don't try this at home!"), or perhaps it is more of the
strange conservatism that magicians sometimes manifest.  Mace's
comments seem, from my perspective, to be quite contradictory.  If the
semi-independent power is not completely autonomous how may one
maintain "a strict separation?"  I'm afraid I'm puzzled.<P>

<HR><P>

<H3>The Care and Feeding of Servitors</H3>

Servitors feed from the obsessional energies of the magician that
created them.  In some cases, vampiric servitors, for example, the
servitor may be charged with feeding from the energies of the
individual or entity that is its target, but even here, the magician
that created it both launches it and controls it with his or her
own obsessional energies.  A book-finding servitor, for example, can
rest dormant until the magician's desire for a certain book sends
it on its way.<P>

Servitors that do not perform according to the magician's desire need
discipline.  This can consist merely of a warning.  On the other
hand a servitor that consistently fails in its duties obviously
needs to be recalled.  Chaos magick is, after all, results oriented
magick.  Servitors can be dissipated by destroying their material
base, by visualizing their dissolution, or by any other means the
magician finds effective.<P>

Servitors may be domiciled on the magician's alter.  I tend to
return mine to a number of crystals strewn about my alter, or to
some other material base there residing.  Since servitors are
semi-independent most authors caution against allowing them to
exist in an uncontrolled form, since, at least in theory, they will
continue to subsist off the life energies of the magician, which
may, over a period of time, debilitate the sorcerer.  Jaq. D. Hawkins,
in her book, "Spirits of the Earth" has the following, fairly typical
admonition about thought-form elementals (her name for servitors):<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"these artificial entities have survival instincts.  Once a
thought
form is created, it will generally continue to take spiritual
energy from its creator until it is dissipated or reabsorbed, which
is something which should be kept in mind when deciding to do this
in the first place.  The energy to sustain a single thought form
may go unnoticed, but sending streams of thought forms off to
do one's bidding could sap one's energy to depletion and lead to
illness.  It is always prudent to have a plan in place to reabsorb
the entity, and therefore one's own energy, once the purpose is
accomplished."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Again, the validity of this admonition has more to do with the
magickal model to which the magician subscribes rather than natural
law.  Certainly magicians using the Spirit Model, the Energy Model,
and even the Psychological Model to an extent, might agree.
Magicians using the Information Model, in which the servitor is
essentially self-replicating code programming energy, might disagree,
since this Model does not require the magician to use his or her
own life force, except perhaps to launch the servitor.  Readers
of this essay are advised to determine which paradigm, or which
combination of paradigms they are using in a particular operation,
and act accordingly in determining whether to reabsorb or dissipate
the servitor.<P>

<HR><P>

<H3>Binding Demons, Elementals, and Other Entities</H3>

As stated above, this essay is primarily concerned with creating
semi-independent entities out of the mind of the magician.  However,
it is possible to use the vast variety of independent entities
that populate the Spirit Model as servitors.  As indicated earlier,
these entities tend to be less manageable for a variety of reasons.
They are products of the group consciousness of Planet Earth, tend
to be more self-willed (and consequently require more energy to be
controlled) and are often contaminated by conflicting instructions
placed upon them by prior sorcerers.  However they may be used,
particularly if the magician has a personal bond with the entity,
through memory, propinquity, or a recognition of psychological
characteristics within the magician that the entity in question
also possesses.  Some of these entities, however, are really godforms,
or extrusions of such, and need to be handled in a quite different
manner, but that's a topic for another essay.  I would encourage
magicians wishing to use these entities to use lesser demons,
minor elementals.<P>

I do not intend to go into detail on the methods the magician
can use to evoke and control these entities.  The annals of magick
are already full of extremely detailed instructions.<P>

However, the question posed earlier, whether one can use a bound demon's
energy to reinforce personality elements that the magician wants to
strengthen, should be answered.<P>

Traditional ceremonial magicians, of course, habitually do this,
summoning, for example, a demon of lust and charging it with the
task of causing an object of his or her amorous attentions to fall
in love with the sorcerer.  In this case, from the viewpoint of the
theory of servitor dynamics outlined in this essay, the magician
has bound the demon of his own lust and converted it into a type
of glamour attractive to the object of his infatuation.<P>

The question was asked, however, by someone who wanted to use a
personality defect as the energy source for a personality asset.
To give an example, resentment towards one's parents, if fed
frequently enough (and isn't it usually) creates demonic energy that
can crystallize into a thought form. Can this demon can be bound
and its energy then used to charge a servitor whose function is
to increase the personality asset of, say, self-confidence?  The
process this would occur would be whereby, every time
the magician feels resentment towards his or her parents,  the
energy from this resentment is directed towards the servitor
whose task is to increase the magician's self-confidence.  The answer
is that the energy from the resentment must be clarified, or filtered,
as it were, before it can be of use to the character enhancing servitor.
An effective method for doing this would be the Free Belief technique
outlined above.  Thus the energy would not be contaminated by the
emotional charge of resentment, but be pure psychic material, suitable
for feeding a servitor.<P>

A final word about the therapeutic techniques of psychodynamic theory
would be useful here since the above technique would be more properly
classified as the use of servitors as a form of magickal psychotherapy.<P>

<HR><P>

<H3>Magick and Psychotherapy</H3>

Modern magick and psychotherapy share a number of commonalties.
Both attempt to empower the individual, both attempt to discern the
relationship of the individual to the universe, both attempt to
make that relationship  as functional, in terms of the individual's goals,
as possible.  Although many magicians might disagree, magick is also an
attempt by the magician to integrate disparate elements of his or her
personality into a unified whole, which is, of course, a primary
goal in psychotherapy.  This is  not to say that magick is psychotherapy.
Magick is clearly a quite different field of human endeavor.  Psychotherapy
generally has a sociological goal, that is the development of personality
assets that allow the individual  to function within society in an
easy and comfortable manner. Magicians generally could care less
about social approval, although they might well  seek the approval of
their magickal peers.<P>

Psychodynamic approaches to psychotherapy (also known as psychoanalysis)
seek to overcome defenses so that repressed materials can be uncovered,
insight into personal motivation can be achieved, and unresolved childhood
issues can be controlled.  Psychoanalysis, probably because of its dismal
success rate and enormous expense, has now pretty much given
way to  psychopharmacological interventions among psychiatrists.
However, servitor  creation and deployment certainly uses
psychoanalytic techniques, to the  extent that the magician attempts
to discover obsessional thought patterns, tries to find out exactly what
 it is that he or she wants, and uses the material of his or her own
psychological history as part of the material  in the development
of the servitor.  The primary difference is that psychoanalysis
seeks to bring repressed materials to the surface so that  they can
dissipate (if, in fact they do), while chaos magicians mine their own
repressions and obsessions for energy to empower creations
of their own imaginations, a goal that many psychiatrists might regard
as being quite contrary to mental health.<P>

Rather than looking at chaos magick in terms of its therapeutic uses
as a psychodynamic form of therapy it may be more accurate to define it
as a modality that looks remarkably similar to that adopted by
situationalist  or contextual psychologists. Situationalism, a view
of personality championed by Walter Mischel argues that whatever
consistency of behavior that is observable is largely determined by the
characteristics of the situation rather than any internal
personality types or traits. From this somewhat radical
perspective it is arguable that personality does not actually
exist, but is a construct placed by an observer on responses that
an individual has to his or her environment.  In other words,
personality is contained in those behavior patterns the observer
chooses to regard. Similarities in patterns of behavior result
from similarities in the situation the individual encounters
rather than any underlying traits or characteristics the
individual might contain. This fluid conception of personality is
integral to Chaos Magic which argues that it is not so much any
internal validity (or consistency!) of belief structures that a
magician may adopt that are important, but rather the tenacity
with which the a magician can hold a belief during the period
contained by the magical rite. Chaos magicians tend to be results
oriented, more concerned, that is, with whether a magical rite
works than with its consistency with any encompassing belief
structures.  Consequently the Chaos magician is quite content
with adopting radically different personality characteristic than
those with which he or she may find comfortable outside the space
and period of the magical rite.  Phil Hine, for example, cites a
magician, who, wishing to pass a test in mathematics at college
adopted the personality (to the best of his ability) of Mr. Spock
from Star Trek for three days before the exam, and then passed
the test with no problems.  The magical practice of invocation,
in which the practitioner adopts the personality characteristics
of the deity or entity he or she invokes, also suggests that
possession rituals are primarily situationist in underlying
theory.  The situation here is the expectation that the invoked
God, demon, or entity will act in certain ways.  Jan Fries, one
of the clearest writers on magic derived from A.O.Spare, writes
of the nearly epileptic seizures of contemporary Japanese spirit
mediums<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Dramatic healings have much to do with play acting and giving
the audience the entertainment it desires.  The medium or shaman
pretends the eternal 'as if' which becomes the 'as is' in the act
of doing."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

To summarize, then, Chaos Magick is distinguished by its
empirical approach to magic (techniques that do not actualize the
magician's desires are discarded), by an assertion that
personality is a construct comprised of belief structures the
individual chooses to regard as containing consistent and
constant elements, and by the idea that the primary obstacle to
the actualization of a desire through a magical rite is the
interference of the conscious mind. The underlying concept here
is that there exists an unconscious, perhaps even a collective
unconscious, termed by Jan Fries "the Deep Mind" and by A.O.Spare
"Kia", but an acceptance of this idea, because of the
situationalist approach of Chaos magicians, not necessary to the
successful fulfillment of desires through magical rituals.  It
is, rather, part of the argument, a method to persuade Chaos
magicians that the techniques may actually work, but the primary
function is rhetorical, not substantive. This is, of course, a
radical approach to magic, not to mention psychology, but it can
be substantiated as an effective approach among certain
individuals.  To be sure, chaos magicians routinely use chaos magickal
techniques for personal psychotherapeutic goals.<P>

Phil Hine recognized this in his User's Guide:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"A purely psychodynamic model of Servitor operation would state
that
our psyche is made up of a very large cluster of forces which can be
projected as intelligences, complexes, or subpersonalities (whether
you're into magick, NLP, Jungian Psychotherapy, etc).  These mental
forces enable us to do some things but prevent us from doing others.
By consciously realigning and redirecting these energies we can
create Servitors which will enable us to do things which we couldn't
do before, such as refrain from compulsive behaviors, thoughts, or
emotions.  In these terms, a Servitor is a conscious form of redirecting
these largely unconscious entities so that they work for
us."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I believe that chaos magickal techniques would actually prove quite
valuable to psychotherapists in the treatment of abnormal behavior,
but that, I'm afraid, is a topic for an entirely different essay.<P>
