<H1>The Magic of Chaos</H1>
<H3>by Pete Carroll</H3>

<HR>

Crowley certainly helped put the boot in against monotheism but
the process was already well advanced. Science, which had basically
evolved out of renaissance magic, had more or less finished monotheism
as a serious parasite on advanced cultures. Crowley was enthusiastic
about science and appropriately so for his era, but in the work
of Austin Spare we begin to detect a certain foreboding. However
it is Spare's work that appears more austere and scientific when
compared to some of Crowley's more baroque symbolic extravagances.
Spare rejected the classical symbologies of forgotten ages and
sought the magic of his own personal arcana. Using the minimum
of hypotheses he evolved a magic from his own racial memories
and subconscious. Independently of complex systems he developed
effective techniques of enchantment and divination requiring only
ordinary language and pictures.<P>

Spare's work forms the bridge between an older style of magic
brought to fruition by Crowley (which derived most of its appeal,
power and liberating potential from its religious style of anti-religion)
and the new magic. The new approach is characterised by a kind
of scientific <I>anti-science</I>. This is increasingly becoming
known as Chaos Magic. It would be no more useful to dub Chaos
Magic as pseudo-science than it would be to dub Crowley's ideas
as pseudo-religion. It is astrology as it is normally practised
that is mere pseudo-science much as satanism and freemasonry are
pseudo-religion.<P>

Chaos Magic attempts to show that not only does magic fit comfortably
within the interstices of science but that the higher reaches
of scientific theory and empiricism actually demand that magic
exists. This is somewhat analogous to the way in which many religious
theories implied the possibility of theurgic or demonic magic.<P>

The best magic has always had a strong antinomian flavour. The
most remarkable magicians have invariably fought against prevailing
cultural norms and obsessions. Their victories represent not only
a personal liberation but also an advance for humanity. History
bequeaths us no records of the renegade shamanist magicians who
must have brought about the advent of paganism, but we know a
little of the anti-pagan magicians who created monotheism: Akhenaton,
Moshe, Gautam, and so on. As monotheism became a steadily more
repressive and obscene force, a new generation of magicians arose
and fought it. Some fought too openly and were destroyed; others
were more subtle and planted effective seeds of destruction on
a purely philosophical level, and others hastened its destruction
by taking theological and theurgical ideas to outrageous conclusions.
The roll of honour is here much larger, including such notables
as Gordiano Bruno, Cornelius Agrippa, John Dee, Cagliostro, Eliphas
Levi, and recently, Aleister Crowley.<P>

Crowley's great achievement, apart from his mountaineering and
futuristic morality was to unearth the power techniques from Tantra,
Yoga, Gnosticism, Taoism and Shamanism. He had the courage to
apply them to the rather dessicated, intellectualised and effete
occultism of his age and created something of lasting value and
interest. In my opinion Crowley's mistake was to accept his own
mystical visions at face value and become dogmatic about them.
He discovered techniques of unleashing the awesome powers and
creativity of the right cerebral hemisphere and subconscious but
was so surprised at the result that he assumed it was of inhuman
origin, and all this despite his dictum that... there are no
gods but man.<P>

What Chaos Magicians are attempting to do is break the stranglehold
of a very limited view of science and rationality exercise over
our imaginations and to force science to mutate into something
less oppressive.<P>

To do this they select as weapons a number of very simple ideas.
Chaos Magic concentrates upon technique. Underlying all systems
from Witchcraft to Tibetan Sorcery, that the eclectically minded
magician may use, there is a fundamental unity of practical technique
depending on visualisation, the creation of thought entities and
altered states of consciousness achieved by either quiescent or
ecstatic meditations. The eclectic point of view implies that
belief itself can be regarded as a technique for achieving one's
aims. A further implication of the principle of relativity of
belief is that all beliefs are considered to be arbitrary and
contingent.<P>

Consequently all notions of absolute truth only exist if we choose
to believe them at any time. The obverse side of the principle
that "nothing is true" is that "everything is permitted",
and Chaos Magicians may often create unusual hyperscience and
sorcery maps of reality as a theoretical framework for their magic.<P>

Improved neurphysiological knowledge combined with the principle
of relativity of belief should lead the modern magician to regard
the revelation with fresh scepticism. Verily the previously unsuspected
parts of our brains can be even more creative than the conscious
parts, and no message from the gods, no matter how extraordinary
and overwhelming, should be taken as proof of anything beyond
our own extraordinary powers, even if accompanied by miracles.<P>

The rejection of any absolute external reality, truth or meaning
may seem a paradoxical or even horrific principle on which to
base a spiritual quest. I personally do not think so. Absolute
truth would be absolute tyranny and historically it has always
been. I would rather the freedom to forge my own spiritual vision.
The evidence of my senses suggests that the universe is basically
random within arbitrary limits which themselves arise capriciously.
Reality is a hierarchy of accidents ruled by pure chance. Even
so-called "scientific laws" are only statistical approximations
describing the most persistent types of accident. I am free, not
because freedom was conferred upon me but as a consequence of
my being a purely accidental creation with random behaviour patterns.<P>

Chaos Magic necessarily implies a certain individualistic antipoliticism
or even anarchy. It is plainly an illusion that people are ruled
by politics. People are ruled by philosophies and fashions, and
it is from this higher level that Chaos Magic launches its attack
on reality. To practice magic implies that you are actively seeking
to forge your own spiritual viewpoint often in contradiction to
cultural norms.<P>

Magic arises to prominence when the boundary of self is either
expanding or contracting. For example, during times of innovation
and discovery, or during times of repression. A profound magical
renaissance is now in progress because the boundary of self is
both expanding and contracting simultaneously. Science, drugs,
psychology, communications networks and all the paraphernalia
of late twentieth century life have expanded aspects of awareness
to a degree inconceivable a century ago.<P>

Conversely, many aspects of industrial civilisation oppress us
and hence encroach on the territory of self. The childish allegories
of religion have been rightfully jettisoned but the whole principle
of the self as a mystic entity has taken a body-blow in the process.
The natural environment is being rubbished to feed the industrial
behemoth and our capacity to relate to it is diminishing. As the
pace of life becomes more frantic the value of introspection becomes
diminished except in art where it is encouraged to become grotesque.
Consumerism and the prospect of thermonuclear armageddon (which
it seems must inevitably accompany it) could diminish us all.
Thus with all these pressures on self, magic has mushroomed and
taken on a colouration distinct from its historical antecedents.
At once there is an extraordinary necrophilia and eclecticism
and at the same time a powerful feeling for anachronistic practices.
Quantum physics rubs shoulders with nature shamanism and Tantric
practices are employed for parapsychological purposes involving
telepathy experiments arranged by satellite link between home
microprocessors whilst ancient goetic incenses smoke away on the
mantlepiece in homemade braziers.<P>

A renaissance is marked by the presence of renaissance people,
and the contemporary magician is very much a renaissance figure
in the sense that the term is usually taken to imply. Contemptuous
of the conventions and paradigms of his age, he looks both backward
and forward in time for techniques to circumvent them. Religion,
and the neo-religious magic that fought it, are dead or dying.<P>
