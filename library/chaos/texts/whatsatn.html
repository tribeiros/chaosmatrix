<H1>What Is Satanism?</H1>

Satanism is a protest behavior that may or may not be connected with persons
beyond the protester. It uses as a symbol Satan, the bogeyman of
Judeo-Christian mythology, who in the Western world is the primary symbol of
the revolt against cosmic injustice.<P>

Protest behaviors are brought about when the inner world of a person,
henceforth referred to as the Subjective Universe, is completely out of
harmony with the conditions prevailing in the other world, henceforth
referred to as the Objective Universe. In a healthy individual protest
behaviors are a way to make the whole person aware for the need of change in
their lives. In unhealthy individuals protest behaviors are obsessive and
symbolic only, and are a sign of individuality making its last stand against
the Objective Universe.<P>

The figure of Satan is chosen since he represents the revolt from God.
Belief in "God" or "Satan" is not the criteria here. "God" is a great symbol
for everything that surrounds a person, and conditions them. "God" is the
town you live in, the people you live with, the paperwork you have to fill
out to do something as simple and healthy as run a small home business, and
that velvet-rope maze that you have to go through to get to an airplane
ticket. "God" represents all and everything that has accumulated since the
beginning of time, that most people in their lives firstly come to accept
and secondly to valorize. "God" is easy to hate or love, but like the
weather hard to do anything with.<P>

"Satan" is not the only figure that may be used against "God." If you see
the patriarchal society as the source of all evil, the "Goddess" is the
likely figure of choice for your spiritual dissent. However Satanists avoid
this symbol, not because of a fear/mistrust of the feminine, but because the
symbol becomes so easily a <I>replacement</I> for the figure of "God."<P>

To make such a revolt, even symbolically, presents four areas of strain in
the life of the rebel. Firstly the social matrix in which the rebel finds
herself will not be supportive of the revolt. In most cases this is desired
on some level. We are deeply aware that we are social creatures and that we
have to enlist the help of others in our Quest for freedom. Sometimes the
easiest way to get their aid is to anger them, so that we can use the
pressure without to aid us in our change within. But beyond the "it's neat
to piss people off" stage there is a human want for approval and affection
that either ends the revolt, or ends the family matrix. Only those destined
to inner strength can manage to revolt and be a family member. Secondly the
notion of "good" -- meaning social norms -- has to sorted out from the idea
of "Good" -- meaning those things that increase and deepen the experience of
healthy humans. Since both "good" and "Good" belong in the constellation of
ideas of "God" -- the rebel has to rethink everything, and he will make
mistakes. Thirdly since the figure of Satan in the postmodern age is an
Image, the material that makes that image so powerful (mainly movies and
rock-n-roll) does not offer an adult role model as does the literary
Satanism of Anatole France or Mark Twain. Figuring out what to do after
you've worn that inverted cross for six weeks is a strain that most can't
take due to the paucity and weakness of their own imagination. In fact it
was due to that very weakness that they fixated on image rather than
thought. Fourthly there is an utter lack of in-depth material on
philosophical Satanism. Most of the information about Satanism is either
psychological studies of protest behavior, Christian propaganda, or material
written to convince an audience that they are already (in some obscure
fashion) lord of the earth. This lack of Lore ends the revolt for all but
the most self sufficient.<P>

It might be thought that leaders of Satanic movements would find these
conditions deplorable. Indeed far from it. By having a situation that
encourages certain responses, Satanists -- which include all sorts of the
scum of the earth -- will self select to a better sort of individual, UNLESS
their bad behaviors are simply enabled by those around them -- giving us the
rather sad picture of a thirty-five-year old man in a faded black T-shirt
living over his parents' garage and saying "Hail Satan!" a great deal.
Each of the four areas of strain provide a strengthening in those that
overcome them. In the area of family and job relations, certain things
occur. The Satanist must develop inner strength to continue in his practice.
He must demonstrate his competence and commitment to the social matrix in
which he lives so that his practices are tolerated. He must develop a
tolerance for the beliefs of others that does not slip into a weak-minded
belief that all systems of human thought are equal. This provides for
emotional training. If the Satanist is, however, enabled, or simply deals
with the strain by running away for good -- he or she will never have this
training and the protest behavior does not lead to a strengthening of
individualism, but merely to an infantile acting out of fantasies that
cannot effect the Objective Universe.<P>

Secondly the notion of "good," "Good," and "God" provide a useful struggle
for the Satanist. On the path of human ethical development, the moment when
she realizes that wearing short black skirts isn't on the same moral plane
as, say, murder the Satanist realizes that a large part of society is a game
designed for the efficient movement of energy and money by unquestioning
obedience. This moment of awakening happens in the lives of most people,
certainly without the stimulus of Satanism. And in the lives of most people
this awakening goes away, long before it can effect the nature of either
personal or human affairs. For the Satanist however the image of Satan
focuses that attention long enough for it to become part of her personal
inventory. This has a positive effect on avoiding entanglements in the
world, by shutting off arguments based on sentimentality and thus causing
the media of the world to have an Awakening effect, exactly the opposite of
what they are designed to have.<P>

Thirdly the strain of lack of direction because of the imagistic nature of
Satan provides two benefits. Firstly since an image rather than a text is
centralized, the Satanist is forced to make changes in his consciousness
based on (hopefully) rational means -- and that any such changes are
*individual* syntheses, rather than group think. However since this is hard
work -- in fact making changes this way is so hard humanity pretty much
dropped this methodology three thousand years ago -- most people make no
changes. They merely become Eskimo Pies, "Dark on the outside, light on the
inside." Secondly, the Satanist must create personal mythological and
aesthetic models for self-guidance. This remains why Satanism has and will
have such a great effect on music and the arts. But again this requires a
depth or Self (or as the world would say, "talent") so most such products
are as uninspired and amateurish as the images which inspired them. Thus a
below-mediocre Satanic culture is maintained that drives away people cursed
with good taste.<P>

Lastly, the lack of Lore forces four sorts of development on the serious
Satanist. He must look to other persons (either historical or of his
personal knowledge) to be role models. He must find people that produced
both a change in themselves and the world through the mechanism of revolt.
This leads to a certain deepening of self as one chooses heroes, whether
artistic revolutionaries like Goethe or political ones like Gandhi. Beyond
role models the question of practice comes to mind; movie images of Satanist
chanting may be great -- but what do they chant? This leads to a certain
"Satanic anthropology" that begins for merely aesthetic reason, but broadens
into the study of the structures of the human psyche. Again the moment that
people have to do something harder than pick up a tome in their local occult
store, most of the weak are weeded away. The creation of lore will (at a
certain level of development) require that the Satanist speak. This means
that he or she must learn certain communication skills on the one hand, and
truly have thought about what they are going to say on the other. This
self-selects for articulate thoughtful people. The weak, who will always be
with us, will have another approach -- getting on late-night radio and
quoting the scripture of another person (usually a bald one). Lastly since
the dissemination of such material is difficult in a world ruled by vast
corporations who have a vested interest in not promoting individuality --
the Satanist (normally an anarchistic lot) -- must voluntarily band
together, which provides for both a social matrix and sets up for cultural
change. It must be stressed however, that Satanism is not about cultural
change as a goal. If one merely identifies with a cultural/political change
and one succeeds, one is made redundant and weak -- and if one fails, one is
bitter and an object of fun. Cultural change, like muscles gained working in
a gym, is not the goal of the individual -- but a pleasant side effect and
way of measuring progress.<P>

Satanism, an unorganized social movement, arises out of the protest behavior
called Satanism. The nature of that behavior against the grain of the social
matrix is one that will of its nature lead to rapid self change (for the
few) and rapid self deterioration for the many. It is easy to locate any
number of the later to speak on the talk show circuit, but the former seek
to give a rather more precise message to the world than can easily be
encapsulated in a sound bite.<P>

It should be noticed that there is a fundamentally developmental path in the
strains caused by Satanism, which act synergetically on the person with
focused attention. These strains -- by the nature of their resistance -- can
empower an individual in his or her work with the world; however they are
ultimately an exterior pressure which can only take you so far. For an even
more select group in this already select group, there arises a need to
develop internal (non-reactive) forces for self change. For these people
there are Initiatory Schools. These Schools are the most feared part of the
Satanic movement, since they can not be easily dismissed as a way to sell
more albums, market cool bumper stickers, or get a spot on the Springer
show. I simply want to leave you with the observation that the School is no
more the object of Satanic practice than social change is. It, too is a
by-product, whose excellence or mediocrity reflects the work of those
involved with it. The object of Satanic practice is, has been, and will
remain the Self.<P>

Six Satanic Saws:<P>

I. It is not about who you are, or what you do, but what you Become.<P>

II. It is not about some guy with horns and a cape, but remembering your own
(forgotten) better nature.<P>

III. It is about becoming the constant in all of your life equations, not
the variable.<P>

IV. Its failures are easy to see and describe; each Success is unique,
powerful and mysterious.<P>

V. It symbols change, but its essence remains the same -- swim against the
stream to be a powerful swimmer.<P>

VI. It can not be accepted by mass culture, but its Nobles can be accepted
by people of good will and sharp minds, on a one-by-one basis.
