    Many, unfortunately, see Kaos Magick as a method ov working with a
variety of magickal systems, and in the end, choosing what they like.
They obviously miss the entire focus ov kaos magick, and instead create
their own personal paradigm. It is a phenomenon that has appeared far
too many times. In essence, the end result is a group of people that
can't agree on anything, because their EGO has become a stronghold to
what they feel is "right", and when someone presents their perspective,
it is unfairly dissected and weighed against an established belief
system. What people fail to realize is that Kaos Magick does not seek to
allow everyone a comfortable paradigm to live in. Kaos Magick is a
psychological WAR. It is operation MINDFUCK. When it comes to Kaos
Magick, nothing is the truth, and ov course everything is permitted.
Thee real problem lies in the fact that people want to become
comfortable with something, or they just simply want something to
believe in. It is a tragic human flaw. Why bother sitting around and
theorizing about how magick works? There is no answer, never will be.
There are certain elements that thee human mind will never understand,
accept it and get over it!<P>

    It is best to work with magick in thee following way. Find what
works for you and exploit it. Kaos Magick isn't about theory, it isn't
about quantum physics, and it definately isn't about asking why. When
you start asking why you immediately fall into a trap, and invoke DOGMA.
What Kaos Magick IS about is really fucking with the way you view
things, and constantly shifting your perspective. Thee mind's I can be
as static or as fluid as you choose. Thee more fluid it is, thee easier
it is to enter a consistent flux ov paradigm shifts. It is thee KIA, or
true self, that we will never fully realize. Kaos magick brings us
closer. Gnosis, or no-mind, destroys our shallow concept ov self that
EGO solidifies. It is thee key to magick. So, wake up tommorow and be a
wiccan for a day, and take on thee paradigm, or better yet wake up as a
christian. Thee more you attack your ego, the harder it fights back. You
are nothing, remember that, because your ego will consistently tell you
otherwise. Nobody ever said that Kaos Magick was easy.<P>
