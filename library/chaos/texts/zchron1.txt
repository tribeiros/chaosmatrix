Chaos Magick: Magickal Terrorism

The practice of magick is generally agreed to be the attempt to create 
change in conformity with the will of the magician.  This change can 
range from a simple acquisition, such as creating circumstances 
favorable to getting a job, to the highly metaphysical, such as 
conversing with the angelic entities of the Elizabethan magus John 
Dee.  Chaos magick, the most recent development in the Ceremonial 
Magickal Tradition, is an innovative, modern, and disturbing approach 
to the realization of the Magickal Intention.

Chaos Magick derives primarily from the work of Austin Osman Spare 
and Peter Carroll in the first and third quarters of the 20th Century 
respectively.  Both magicians aggressively argued against the 
exclusion of sorcerous techniques from magickal practice and both 
developed systems of magick that were inclusive, eclectic and 
innovative.  Both generally spurned traditional magick as needlessly 
complicated, discriminatory, and impotent.  Spare, being an artist, 
was clearly influenced by other magickal artists such as William 
Blake, and was also influenced by the relatively new field of 
psychiatry, particularly by the work of Jung and Freud on the 
subconscious.  Spare stressed the integration of magick into all areas 
of his life, and so it is not possible, in examining Spare’s drawings, 
for example, to distinguish between them and magickal work.  Spare’s 
drawings are spells. Spare’s work is mostly out of print.  Some of his 
writings are available online.  Carroll, writing soon after the 
development of Chaos Scientific Theory, was equally influenced by 
the possibilities of using the language and tools of magick as a means 
to discover and influence the subatomic interactions of the quantum 
universe. Carroll also founded the Illuminati of Thanateros (the IOT), 
an Order of Chaos Magicians.  The Order is somewhat controversial in 
the greater community of Chaos magicians since it is a secretive 
degreed hierarchy.  Secrets, degrees, and hierarchies are often 
considered to run counter to the Chaos current.  Carroll’s introductory  
work “Liber Null and Psychonaut” is the most widely available  work 
on Chaos Magick.  It remains in print. More recently the ideas of Chaos 
Magick have been extended further into art by Jan Fries, whose 
brilliant and friendly excursion into drawing, “Visual Magick”, is, 
unfortunately, only available in England. Stephen Mace has privately 
printed fascinating analyses of the interface between demonology and 
Chaos Magick, “Stealing the Fire from Heaven” being the most widely 
read.  Phil Hine has published pamphlets on Chaos Magick and the 
Necronomicon.   Finally seminal forays  into the application of Chaos 
Magick to social dynamics and communications theory by Hakim Bey 
have recently extended the theories of Chaos Magick into music, 
performance art and the Internet.

In more general terms Chaos Magick uses the deconstructionist 
theories of Jacques Derrida, the interest in random phenomena of John 
Cage and Minimalism, and the humor of Dada to create ritual spaces 
for magickal acts.  To view Chaos Magick solely as a reformulation of 
traditional magick, however, would be inaccurate.  Chaos Magick is 
something new, an attempt to deconstruct consensual belief 
structures, free the energy trapped by these beliefs, and radically 
alter the movement of the quantum flux.  Chaos Magick is an assault 
on normative belief patterns, an attack on the mind’s status quo, 
guerrilla war on the careful considerations of consciousness.

Chaos Magick focuses on the mechanism of belief, and suggests that 
the process of belief rather than the object of belief is the critical 
element in magick.  Chaos Magicians will adopt or refute positions of 
belief as needed for the successful resolution of magickal acts.  This 
orientation, which stresses adaptability as a prime asset and greets 
change as an accurate reflection of the true nature of reality can be 
extremely destabilizing for individuals whose sense of personal 
identity requires that the universe be perceived as an ordered and 
meaningful place.  Chaos Magick specifically refutes the possibility 
of eternal rest, of eternal order.  It views the universe as a 
phenomena of complexity at an order of magnitude too great for 
normal human psychology to understand.  In fact, Chaos Magicians 
would argue that the universe is in such a state of flux and apparently 
random movement that only  devious techniques such as those of 
Chaos Magick, which deliberately subvert the conscious, rational mind 
have any chance of creating change in conformity with the will of the 
magician. 

Chaos Magick is self-annihilating, bearing  commonality with the 
crazy wisdom of the fringe elements of the nyingmapa school of 
Tibetan Buddhism, with the mad monks of Zen Buddhism, and with the 
theoretical structures of Nagarjuna and the Madhyamaka schools of 
Buddhism. One of the two central Sutras (Buddhist teachings) of 
Madhyamaka is the Prajna Paramita, a Sutra whose title is loosely 
translated as “ Beyond the beyond, there lies awakening”, and whose 
structure, in which form and emptiness (Chaos and Order) are 
identified with one another, resembles that of contemporary chaos 
ritual.  The founder of the nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism was 
the sorcerer-buddha Padmasambhava, and some of the rituals, such as 
the graveyard rituals of Chod practice, are hardly distinguishable 
from the Chaos magician’s use of the Eldar Gods of the Necronomicon.  
The koans of Zen Buddhism are designed to short circuit the 
discursive mind and bring about a state of mind similar to that sought 
by the Chaos magician. 

Chaos Magick can be considered to be a  psychological approach to 
magickal ritual.  Bearing many similarities to the Stanislavsky 
system of Method  Acting,the ritual systems of Chaos Magick aim at 
blocking the conscious mind and generating a state of consciousness 
known as “gnosis”, a state of mind in which the defenses of the 
discursive mind are overthrown and the magickal intention of the 
magician can be driven deep into the Absolute, that is to say into the 
quantum flux of the universe.  Like Method Actors, Chaos Magicians 
seek to forget their identity in order to achieve their will, the change 
in the universe that is the goal of the magickal act.  To do this Chaos 
Magicians use gesture, ritual, sound, visualization, the cues of their 
senses, meditation,and generated emotional states such as anger, 
fear, disgust, boredom or despair.  Any method that can create the 
momentary state of gnosis is considered acceptable.  Favorite 
techniques frequently involve sex, pain, and confusion.  Chaos 
Magicians use sigils (magickal intentions that have been transformed 
into symbolic structures), rituals from any source, the artefacts of 
esoteric or popular culture to form  a magickal space that might bring 
about gnosis.

Chaos Magick is non-discriminatory and refutes dualism.  Rooted in 
the realization of the quantum flux and recognizing that ideas are not 
reality (although they may influence the perception of reality) Chaos 
Magick does not discriminate between White, Grey and Black Magick, 
between evil and good, between right and wrong.  Consequently Chaos 
Magick is probably not for those who have not internalized a personal 
moral or ethical code.  In fact, most Chaos Magicians would probably 
define themselves, if pressed, as Black Magicians but may, in this 
self-definition, be referring to Magick that has to do with that which 
is hidden, or in darkness, and so is black.  Chaos Magick is neither for 
the squeamish, nor for those who wish to argue points of ethics, nor 
for those obsessed with establishing varieties of social order.  
Ceremonial Magick and Wicca provide ample opportunities for those 
who wish to do the latter.  Chaos Magick is concerned with developing 
magick that works, rituals that have specific effects, that create 
change in conformity with the will of the chaos magician, that are 
testable and can be replicated, that affect the Chaos Magician’s deep 
self in sometimes catastrophic ways, that are non-judgmental, non-
hierarchical and devious.

Those who are interested in the practice of Chaos Magick are warned 
that Chaos Magick can be destabilizing.  Since it is designed to 
deconstruct belief , dearly held opinions, the stories we tell 
ourselves to lull ourselves into a sense of security will tend to fray 
and unravel.  Unless the magician is willing to forsake these old 
ideas, to allow the boundaries of personal identity to be disrupted the 
result of magickal action may be chaotic indeed.  Dramatic life 
changes, sometimes perceived as being for the worse, are a commonly 
reported result of Chaos Magickal Rites.  Fundamentally, Chaos Magick 
is not about discovering one’s True Will, nor communing with the 
Mother Goddess, nor even associating with demons, but with the 
direct, startling apprehension of the Chaos current, the quantum flux 
of an unhuman universe.  Chaos Magick is magickal terrorism.

Excerpts from Chaos: The Broadsheets of Ontological Anarchism by 
Hakim Bey

CHAOS: THE BROADSHEETS OF ONTOLOGICAL ANARCHISM
(Dedicated to Ustad Mahmud Ali Abd al-Khabir)

Chaos

CHAOS NEVER DIED. Primordial uncarved block, sole worshipful
monster, inert & spontaneous, more ultraviolet than any
mythology (like the shadows before Babylon), the original
undifferentiated oneness-of-being still radiates serene as
the black pennants of Assassins, random & perpetually
intoxicated.

Chaos comes before all principles of order & entropy, it's
neither a god nor a maggot, its idiotic desires encompass &
define every possible choreography, all meaningless aethers
& phlogistons: its masks are crystallizations of its own
facelessness, like clouds.

Everything in nature is perfectly real including
consciousness, there's absolutely nothing to worry about.
Not only have the chains of the Law been broken, they never
existed; demons never guarded the stars, the Empire never
got started, Eros never grew a beard.

No, listen, what happened was this: they lied to you, sold
you ideas of good & evil, gave you distrust of your body &
shame for your prophethood of chaos, invented words of
disgust for your molecular love, mesmerized you with
inattention, bored you with civilization & all its usurious
emotions.

There is no becoming, no revolution, no struggle, no path;
already you're the monarch of your own skin--your inviolable
freedom waits to be completed only by the love of other
monarchs: a politics of dream, urgent as the blueness of
sky.

To shed all the illusory rights & hesitations of history
demands the economy of some legendary Stone Age--shamans not
priests, bards not lords, hunters not police, gatherers of
paleolithic laziness, gentle as blood, going naked for a
sign or painted as birds, poised on the wave of explicit
presence, the clockless nowever.

Agents of chaos cast burning glances at anything or anyone
capable of bearing witness to their condition, their fever
of _lux_et_voluptas_. I am awake only in what I love &
desire to the point of terror--everything else is just
shrouded furniture, quotidian anaesthesia, shit-for-brains,
sub-reptilian ennui of totalitarian regimes, banal
censorship & useless pain.

Avatars of chaos act as spies, saboteurs, criminals of amour
fou, neither selfless nor selfish, accessible as children,
mannered as barbarians, chafed with obsessions, unemployed,
sensually deranged, wolfangels, mirrors for contemplation,
eyes like flowers, pirates of all signs & meanings.

Here we are crawling the cracks between walls of church
state school & factory, all the paranoid monoliths. Cut off
from the tribe by feral nostalgia we tunnel after lost
words, imaginary bombs.
The last possible _deed_ is that which defines perception
itself, an invisible golden cord that connects us: illegal
dancing in the courthouse corridors. If I were to kiss you
here they'd call it an act of terrorism--so let's take our
pistols to bed & wake up the city at midnight like drunken
bandits celebrating with a fusillade, the message of the
taste of chaos.

Chaos Myths

Unseen Chaos (po-te-kitea)
Unpossessed, Unpassing
Chaos of utter darkness
Untouched & untouchable
--Maori Chant

Chaos perches on a sky-mountain: a huge bird like a yellow
bag or red fireball, with six feet & four wings--has no face
but dances & sings.

Or Chaos is a black longhaired dog, blind & deaf, lacking
the five viscera.
Chaos the Abyss comes first, then Earth/Gaia, then
Desire/Eros. From these three proceed two pairs--Erebus &
old Night, Aether & Daylight.

Neither Being nor Non-being
neither air nor earth nor space:
what was enclosed? where? under whose
protection?
What was water, deep, unfathomable?
Neither death nor immortality, day nor night--
but ONE breathed by itself with no wind.
Nothing else. Darkness swathed in darkness,
unmanifest water.
The ONE, hidden by void,
felt the generation of heat, came into being
as Desire, first seed of Mind...
Was there an up or down?
There were casters of seed, there were powers:
energy underneath, impulse above.
But who knows for sure?
--_Rg_Veda_

Tiamat the Chaos-Ocean slowly drops from her womb Silt &
Slime, the Horizons, Sky and watery Wisdom. These offspring
grow noisy & bumptious--she considers their destruction.

But Marduk the wargod of Babylon rises in rebellion against
the Old Hag & her Chaos-monsters, chthonic totems--Worm,
Female Ogre, Great Lion, Mad Dog, Scorpion Man, Howling
Storm--dragons wearing their glory like gods--& Tiamat
herself a great sea-serpent.

Marduk accuses her of causing sons to rebel against fathers-
-she loves Mist & Cloud, principles of disorder. Marduk will
be the first to rule, to invent government. In battle he
slays Tiamat & from her body orders the material universe.
He inaugurates the Babylonian Empire--then from gibbets &
bloody entrails of Tiamat's incestuous son he creates the
human race to serve forever the comfort of gods--& their
high priests & anointed kings.

Father Zeus & the Olympians wage war against Mother Gaia &
the Titans, those partisans of Chaos, the old ways of
hunting & gathering, of aimless wandering, androgyny & the
license of beasts.

Amon-Ra (Being) sits alone in the primordial Chaos-Ocean of
NUN creating all the other gods by jerking off--but Chaos
also manifests as the dragon Apophis whom Ra must destroy
(along with his state of glory, his shadow & his magic) in
order that the Pharoah may safely rule--a victory ritually
re-created daily in Imperial temples to confound the enemies
of the State, of cosmic Order.

Chaos is Hun Tun, Emperor of the Center. One day the South
Sea, Emperor Shu, & the North Sea, Emperor Hu (_shu_hu_ =
lightning) paid a visit to Hun Tun, who always treated them
well. Wishing to repay his kindness they said, "All beings
have seven orifices for seeing, hearing, eating, shitting,
etc.--but poor old Hun Tun has none! Let's drill some into
him!" So they did--one orifice a day--till on the seventh
day, Chaos died.

But...Chaos is also an enormous chicken's egg. Inside it
P'an-Ku is born & grows for 18,000 years--at last the egg
opens up, splits into sky & earth, yang & yin. Now P'an-Ku
grows into a column that holds up the universe--or else he
_becomes_ the universe (breath-->wind, eyes-->sun & moon,
blood & humors-->rivers & seas, hair & lashes-->stars &
planets, sperm-->pearls, marrow-->jade, his fleas-->human
beings, etc.)

Or else he becomes the man/monster Yellow Emperor. Or else
he becomes Lao Tzu, prophet of Tao. In fact, poor old Hun
Tun is the Tao itself.

"Nature's music has no existence outside things. The various
apertures, pipes, flutes, all living beings together make up
nature. The "I" cannot produce things & things cannot
produce the "I," which is self-existent. Things are what
they are spontaneously, not caused by something else.
Everything is natural & does not know why it is so. The
10,000 things have 10,000 different states, all in motion as
if there were a True Lord to move them--but if we search for
evidence of this Lord we fail to find any." (Kuo Hsiang)

Every realized consciousness is an "emperor" whose sole form
of rule is to do nothing to disturb the spontaneity of
nature, the Tao. The "sage" is not Chaos itself, but rather
a loyal child of Chaos--one of P'an-Ku's fleas, a fragment
of flesh of Tiamat's monstrous son. "Heaven and Earth," says
Chuang Tzu, "were born at the same time I was, & the 10,000
things are one with me."

Ontological Anarchism tends to disagree only with the
Taoists' total quietism. In our world Chaos has been
overthrown by younger gods, moralists, phallocrats, banker-
priests, fit lords for serfs. If rebellion proves impossible
then at least a kind of clandestine spiritual jihad might be
launched. Let it follow the war-banners of the anarchist
black dragon, Tiamat, Hun Tun.

Chaos never died.

Sorcery

THE UNIVERSE WANTS TO PLAY. Those who refuse out of dry
spiritual greed & choose pure contemplation forfeit their
humanity--those who refuse out of dull anguish, those who
hesitate, lose their chance at divinity--those who mold
themselves blind masks of Ideas & thrash around seeking some
proof of their own solidity end by seeing out of dead men's
eyes.

Sorcery: the systematic cultivation of enhanced
consciousness or non-ordinary awareness & its deployment in
the world of deeds & objects to bring about desired results.

The incremental openings of perception gradually banish the
false selves, our cacophonous ghosts--the "black magic" of
envy & vendetta backfires because Desire cannot be forced.
Where our knowledge of beauty harmonizes with the
_ludus_naturae_, sorcery begins.

No, not spoon-bending or horoscopy, not the Golden Dawn or
make-believe shamanism, astral projection or the Satanic
Mass--if it's mumbo jumbo you want go for the real stuff,
banking, politics, social science--not that weak blavatskian
crap.

Sorcery works at creating around itself a psychic/physical
space or openings into a space of untrammeled expression--
the metamorphosis of quotidian place into angelic sphere.
This involves the manipulation of symbols (which are also
things) & of people (who are also symbolic)--the archetypes
supply a vocabulary for this process & therefore are treated
as if they were both real & unreal, like words. Imaginal
Yoga.

The sorcerer is a Simple Realist: the world is real--but
then so must consciousness be real since its effects are so
tangible. The dullard finds even wine tasteless but the
sorcerer can be intoxicated by the mere sight of water.
Quality of perception defines the world of intoxication--but
to sustain it & expand it to include _others_ demands
activity of a certain kind--sorcery.
Sorcery breaks no law of nature because there is no Natural
Law, only the spontaneity of _natura_naturans_, the tao.
Sorcery violates laws which seek to chain this flow--
priests, kings, hierophants, mystics, scientists &
shopkeepers all brand the sorcerer _enemy_ for threatening
the power of their charade, the tensile strength of their
illusory web.

A poem can act as a spell & vice versa--but sorcery refuses
to be a metaphor for mere literature--it insists that
symbols must cause events as well as private epiphanies. It
is not a critique but a re-making. It rejects all
eschatology & metaphysics of removal, all bleary nostalgia &
strident futurismo, in favor of a paroxysm or seizure of
_presence_.

Incense & crystal, dagger & sword, wand, robes, rum, cigars,
candles, herbs like dried dreams--the virgin boy staring
into a bowl of ink--wine & ganja, meat, yantras & gestures--
rituals of pleasure, the garden of houris & sakis--the
sorcerer climbs these snakes & ladders to a moment which is
fully saturated with its own color, where mountains are
mountains & trees are trees, where the body becomes all
time, the beloved all space.

The tactics of ontological anarchism are rooted in this
secret Art--the goals of ontological anarchism appear in its
flowering. Chaos hexes its enemies & rewards its
devotees...this strange yellowing pamphlet, pseudonymous &
dust-stained, reveals all...send away for one split second
of eternity.

Definitions of Chaos Magick from the Alt.Magick.Chaos Newsgroup


the jugglers of Truth,
   the molders of Beauty" 
   -- Hanafax from _The Knight of the Swords_ by Michael Moorcock

--------------------------------------------------------------

  "...if you want a one-line definition with which most Chaoists
   would probably not disagree, then I offer the following.
   Chaoists usually accept the meta-belief that belief is a tool
   for achieving effects; it is not an end in itself."
  			-- 
Peter Carroll
  			   
January, 1992

--------------------------------------------------------------

  In Chaos Magic, beliefs are not seen as ends in themselves, but as 
  tools for creating desired effects. To fully realize this is to 
  face a terrible freedom in which Nothing is True and Everything is 
  Permitted, which is to say that everything is possible, there are 
  no certainties, and the consequences can be ghastly. Laughter 
  seems to be the only defence against the realisation that one does 
  not even have a real self.

  So welcome to the Kali Yuga of the Pandaemonaeon wherein nothing is
  true and everything is permissable. For in these post-absolutist 
  days it is better to build upon the shifting sands than the rock 
  which will confound you on the day it shatters. Philosophers have 
  become no more than the keepers of useful sarcasms, for the secret 
  is out that there is no secret of the universe. All is Chaos and 
  evolution is going nowhere in particular. It is pure chance which 
  rules the universe and thus, and only thus, is life good. We are 
  born accidentally into a random world where only seeming causes 
  lead to apparent effects, and very little is predetermined, 
  thank Chaos.

  Reject then the obscenities of contrived uniformity, order and 
  purpose. Turn and face the tidal wave of Chaos from which 
  philosophers have been fleeing in terror for millennia. Leap in 
  and come out surfing its crest, sporting amidst the limitless 
  weirdness and mystery in all things, for those who reject false 
  certainties. Thank Chaos we shall never exhaust it. 
  Create, destroy, enjoy, IO CHAOS!

  It begins with knowing how near and how far Whatever is.  Then you 
  concentrate on the placement of objects.  Take neither nourishment, 
  nor stimulant nor any drug.  Use pain, when it comes, as a sharp 
  wedge into the lower half.  

  Dance.  Climb a mountain.  Strip off your clothes (read civilization)
  and break something cherished that owns you as you own it.

  Avoid recruiters, and shoo away those who want to "teach you magick"
  To paraphrase Austin Spare, all any teacher can do is show you your
  own magnificence.

  Examine your obsessions.  What are they, really?  Fuel.  Burn them
  up and move on.  Don't let anything restrict you, least of all 
  "groups" (the shortest path to nowhere).  Every group implies
  hierarchy, whatever their press kits may say, and any structure is a
  lessening of the degree of freedom.  Chaos is the greatest degree of 
  freedom there can be, as it encompasses all potential and 
  possibility.

  Turn your will against your fears and your insecurities.  Bury 
  yourself. Hang upside-down and sing "Hallelujah" in public.  People 
  will think you mad, but what's one more madman, and isn't madness 
  often little more than the folly of genius?

  You *are* involved!  Everything is involved, and it's really a 
  question of what the nature of your involvement will be.  
  Welcome; 
  
  I hope we haven't kept you waiting too long  :=}

  Try everything.  Be ye manic!!!  We are all our own set of variables,
  and for each of us there are at least slightly different ways by 
  which we can shortcut cause-and-effect.  The only secrets are the 
  ones that have to do with the ways that work for *you*, even if 
  others say you're wrong.  All that matters is effectiveness, and 
  the only way to find these keys is to *do*.  It takes time, and it 
  takes effort, and maybe even a little bit of your own substance; 
  think of it as an investment, if nothing more.  It will, without 
  question, pay off.

  But you have to start *now*... because a part of the set of variables 
  is time, and its a very limiting factor.

  Lean way back, hold your breath, and count backwards from 418.

  It's begun  :=}

  "Chaos Theory" is generally concerned with making more complex 
  physical predictions, sometimes based on a "chaos/order" 
  measurement.
  "Chaos Magick" may or may not be concerned with utelizing 
  paradigms of
  "chaos theory" to exert change in accordance with ones telos 
  (in my case it would certainly be the former)... 

  "Chaos Magick" may also be the latest attempt to appeal to the 
  testosterone junkie set of the magickal community via their 
  lust of destruction, much as other LHP groups 
  (Satanists & sinister Pagans) do in other ways.

                                       THE  Z  MANIFESTO

The Z(cluster) is a group of chaos magicians who have temporarily 
aggregated for the purpose of cracking the universal consensual belief 
structure and thus bringing about the end of the world.  Originating in 
a cluster of New Orleans sorcerers who are artists, musicians and 
writers, mostly gay, with a strong contingent from the leather 
community, the Z(cluster) is an attempt to configure a new form of 
organization, one that is non-hierarchichal, non-dogmatic, inclusive, 
anarchistic, and flexible.  The Z(cluster) is open to all.  Membership 
requires a simple declaration.  There are no dues.  There are no grades.  
There are no leaders.  There is no received truth.  Opinions of 
Z(cluster) members, including these statements, are personal and 
non-binding and may be adopted or discarded by members as whim or 
analytic thought provides.

The first node of the Z(cluster), the New Orleans group, has decided 
transiently to call itself T(word)A(word)Z(word).  Other groups or 
individuals that wish to align themselves with the first node may do 
so by naming themselves anything that includes a word that begins 
with Z. Readers of this document are now cautioned that this 
terminology is a viral meme.  

Z(cluster) members and nodes may or may not offer the following to 
each other:

	Group ritual.  Results testing.  Journalling.  Lectures, articles, 
poems.  Spells.  Floggings.  Sex.  T-shirts.  Magickal conspiracies. 
Discount   books on sorcery. Occult combat.  Jewelry. Training in yoga, 
martial arts, and small arms. Ceramics. Emotional support. Cynical 
revilement.  Custom leather and art to wear.  Music. Noise.  
Membership in a food co-op.  Computer expertise.  Participation in 
performance art pieces. Other services, interactions, and products too 
numerous to list. 

In New Orleans, the Temple Azathoth Zygoats meets about every two 
weeks.                           

While the New Orleans node offers itself, for the time being, as a 
clearinghouse for projects by and information about the Z(cluster), 
membership in the cluster does not require contacting the 
T(word)A(word)Z(word).  If you do wish to contact us, the address 
follows:

                                  Copyright Notice

Products issuing from the Z(cluster) are  copyright free, as long as 
individual members do not state otherwise (incurring, if they do, 
group revilement).  Copy our products, hack our programs, rip off our 
designs.  You pay the karmic debt (if that’s your paradigm).  We might 
subject you to sorcerous attack, but we will not sue you.

Questions and Answers on the Z(Cluster)



1.  What is the Z(Cluster)?

The Z(Cluster) is a chaos infection, spreading through the internet, 
and lodging in the damaged neocorteces of chaos magicians foolish 
enough to believe that magick can be performed through the recycled
electrons of the world wide data web.


2.  O.K. I’m damaged enough.  How can I join?

Joining the Z(Cluster) requires a simple declaration.  Actually getting 
anything out of it requires telling marik@aol.com that you are a 
member.  Since the Z(Cluster) is also a clearinghouse for chaos related
messages, rituals, and documents, getting on marik's list is a prereq-
uisite for mailings.

3.  Who belongs to the Z(Cluster)?

As of 6/21/95 there are three known nodes of the cluster: Terminated 
Amber Zepellins in New Orleans, or TAZ, a group with between 12 and 
15 members who meet once every two weeks; the ZMA in Norway, a 
node hosted by Martin Knutsen;  Yellow(Z) in San Francisco,hosted
by dagaz@netcom.com. There may be others, developed by magicians
who have expressed interest but choose not to notify the TAZ
and others that were active but are now moribund.

4.  What does the Z(Cluster) have to offer?

The Z(Cluster) offers ongoing series of online rituals, rooted 
generally in group or individual work performed by nodes.  An example 
of this was the recent Zerbat Satellite Rite on Mardi Gras day.  The 
TAZ group in New Orleans also offers a number of other services, a 
description of which may be found in the ZManifesto file, available 
from marik@aol.com.


5.  Who is Hakim Bey and what does he have to do with the Z(Cluster)?

We don’t really know who Hakim Bey is, except that he’s a weedy kind 
of guy who probably smokes too much pot, and whose voice can be 
heard on a great Bill Lazwell CD called “TAZ”.  Bey wrote  “Chaos-the 
Broadsheets of Ontological Anarchy”, a clever attempt to integrate 
sorcery with art, science, and agitprop.

There is some evidence to suggest that Hakim Bey, discovering himself
perilously close to being mediated, has committed ritual suicide,
although this is not to say that the man who presented himself publicly
as Hakim Bey is not alive and kicking.

The Z(Cluster) is an organization using theories of social dynamics 
developed by Bey.  Bey’s theory of the Temporary Autonomous Zone, an 
ephemeral niche within the body politic in which freedom can be 
experienced, forms the template for the Z(Cluster). In its essence the 
TAZ attempts to replicate the social dynamics of a dinner party 
between close friends.  The food is good, the conversation bracing, 
and we all take turns cooking and cleaning up.

6.  What files does marik have?

Marik offers the following files:

     ZManifesto:  the founding document of the TAZ group, and the 12 
     Principles of Chaos.
     Chao.txt:  Mark Chao’s useful  Introduction to Chaos Magick
     TAZ.txt:  the full text of Hakim Bey’s book, includes Chaos the 
     Broadsheets of Ontological Anarchism.
     PAZ.txt   Revisionist thought from the father of the TAZ
     Satellite.txt:  the Mardi Gras Zerbat Satellite Rite, including the 
     Press Release,and other goodies.
     Introducing Chaos.txt  A Compendium containing much of the above
