<H2>DANCING ON A KNIFE'S EDGE</H2>

<HR>
Deliberate magical duels between sorcerors are generally regarded
as 'black magick' by westerners, yet magical combat can be an
extremely powerful way of bringing a trainee magician to full
operancy. Such 'tests of fitness' can be found in the trials of
Zen pupils under various masters, the shamanistic explorations
of Carlos Casteneda or Lynn Andrews, and the legend of Nimue and
Merlin.<P>

As part of an initiation, a candidate may be expected to defend
a spot or object, despite all the combined efforts of the group
to flaunt her. Long-range magical attack may employ telepathic
destructive impulses, projection of thought-forms or sympathetic
(unsympathetic?) magick.<P>

Magical Combat should be differentiated from psychic attack, with
which a large proportion of 'fringe' occultists concern themselves
with, and is largely a product of self-delusion and varying degrees
of megalomania. True magical combat has its own rules and boundaries,
which are known to the skilled, while the trainee must quickly
learn them if trauma is to be avoided. Caught up in a situation
which s/he finds incomprehensible and alien, the trainee only
knows confusion and terror. Stripped of the smug self-assurance
of "it can't happen to me" s/he learns to perceive the
environment with clarity, to give attention to the rhythms and
pulses of the world. Truly, Death is a great teacher. If you can
reach forwards and see the moment of your 'death', then that moment
will give you a glimpse of your potential.<P>

In this, the magician is less of a warrior and more of a thief
(granted, 'Chaos Thief' isn't as attractive a label as 'Chaos
Warrior'). Prometheus is the appropriate mythic image - the stealer
of fire. No-one can fight Death and win, but s/he can be outwitted.
The magician is one who capers and antics, the wise fool. No-one
takes a fool seriously. Become a fool and lay a false trail. Drop
the po-faced mask of 'initiate' and take your partners for the
masque!<P>

The progress of western magicians does not seem as terrible as
the travails of magicians in other cultures. Since so much 'knowledge'
can be bought, the idea of striving against trials for power seems
foreign. This is not just a glamour; life-threatening or mentally-traumatic
situations can open the floodgates of magical ability in a way
that no weekend workshop or correspondence course ever can. Living
on the Edge is an appropriate phrase, as there is no room
for half-measures. A magical combat, if properly arranged, will
force you to relearn what you need to be able to do in order to
survive. If a Magus is going to pass her power to another, she
must be sure that the candidate has the qualities (i.e. a survival
instinct and staying power) necessary to accept the responsibility
(karma?) that attends the position. The aim of such combat is
constructive, but if the candidate fails - so must it be.<BR>
