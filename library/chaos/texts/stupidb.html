<H1>The Stupid Book</H1>

<HR>

0. This Dumb Book is the Utterance of Eris. Speak me not aloud,
for only in the silences between spaces may I be heard.<P>

1. My priest is mute, for he is enraptured by my kisses. My lips
are ice, the fire (glyph of Shin) of my tongues burns upon his
brow.<P>

2. The past knows me not. Each moment is a new beginning. The
future is written on the folds of my gown. And I have shed my
gown; the possibilities of all things not yet born.<P>

3.in all things adore me. The love-play of agonies and ecstacies.<P>

Be here with me. Now. Forever.<P>

4.Matter is my playground. I make and break without thought. Laugh
and come UNTO me.<P>

5.My priest knows my secret name.<P>

6.Lust, I tell you, but not after result, for thereby you are
bound. naked I come to you. My body is outlined in the stars.<P>

7.Seek me not without, seek me not within.<P>

8.I am dancer and the dance. Let all things unite in nought.<P>

9.The passion play of sight and sound: All things come to you
as I refuse nothing!<P>

10.I am the whole and the none. All qabalahs are equal. think
not to bind me in one; fore I am none.<P>

11.Think not to worship, for I shall strip you of all weight.
You are but a peacock's feather in my hair. understand this!<P>

12.I am the root of all that is to come!<P>

13.You are the apple of my eye; gold and silver.<P>

14.The fool is already mine. Let the Magus become a juggler in
the streets. this is more honest.<P>

15.Let my priestess be the whore of the Gutters.<P>

16.there is no message in this book!<P>

17.My trees bear a strange fruit: share and share alike.<P>

18.All is revealed in my secret name.<P>

19.Every number is mine.<P>

20.Write of me in red, so my secret is plain to see.<P>

21.Seek me not in any temple, save that which is my bed. Seek
me not in meditation set aside. I am here. Now! My perfume is
carried on the winds. Dance and be Damned!<P>

22.I am the cast, but the fallen rune is forgotten. be joyful,
I am ever-present!<P>

23.Ah!Ah! I still the hand that that writes. let us love forever.
Nothing is hidden. it is you that is absurd. Ring down the curtain.<P>

Notes<P>

1. the "secret name" of Eris is INFORMATION, an 11-lettered word. <P>

3.Apples: Gold = Sun. Silver = Moon. Bit obvious that.<P>

4.da'ath is of course, the "strange fruit" on the tree.
Have a vision of a 23rd Atu, a no-path which links Yesod and Da'ath.
the card's title is KAOS, the letter is the glyph of zero, and
the astrological sign that of Arachne.<P>

5.Eris is the fool aspect of Ma'at. E called her,
"she who lives life".<P>

6.In OTCOT, Grant notes Nema's vision of a 23rd Tarot Atu, whose
symbols are a ballerina, a clown, a winged eye, &amp; a frog.
this recalls verses 4,8, and 14 of the above.<P>

7.Vs 11 above is reminiscient of Liber Pennae Praenumbra.<BR>
