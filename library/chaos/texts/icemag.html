<H1>Ice Magic, an initial view</H1>
<H3>by Frater U.'.D.'.</H3>

<HR>

In the colder regions of the earth, especially so in the area of the
polar circle around the north pole, the elementary survival of man
and animal alike, in their struggle against the most unhospitable
powers of nature conceivable, certainly met with a challenge greater
than anywhere else. it is no coincidence that it is amongst the tribes
and peoples from the most northern regions of our planet that one
finds the cradle of technologies and knowledge, the mechanisms and
efficiency of which surpass all others. their description is but one
of many tasks which the book ice magic meets in an befitting and serious
manner.<P>

At some point in the course of the past months and years the
author took the liberty of tentatively labelling all forms and contents
pertaining to this topic as "ice magic" in his conversations and lectures.
this mere title led some people to the wildest speculations and most
absurd fantasies. add to that the intermingling of only half understood
information, rumours and pure conjecture, as has actually occurred,
and the claim by others to understanding or explanation of the meaning
of "ice magic" cannot but lose every base in its very conception.
hence the need for this presentation!<P>

It seems to be the fate of well-meant improvisations aiming at
a crudely simplified and easy to grasp introduction to a world of
paths hitherto untravelled and possibilities never exercised, to raise
many a latent fear, as well as stimulating the proverbial bias of
the timid and diffident, wavering and demure towards prejudice of
any kind, which serves to protect such people from reality.<P>

There are a great number of better reasons, albeit including those
mentioned above, to supply a general entree for the expert and the
interested public alike to this realm of highly powerful and fascinating
practices, techniques and legacies.<P>

When taking into account its history, the term "magic", like
a blank piece of paper, is most forbearing and receptive for all sorts
of conjectures - possible and impossible alike. but when it comes
to the power and the skill i.e. the ability of human beings to act
in a manner transgressing conventional rules and "laws of nature",
this long-suffering term should be more than apt to spell out all
exactions and assertions concomitant.<P>

Granted that the well-known formula, "magic is the art and the
science to cause change with the aid of alternate states of consciousness
in conformity with will", to take but one example, may represent a
first notion when undertaking to describe the subject matter at hand.
after all, it shows distinctly the insufficiency of those presumptions
and tools we are forced to employ when approaching this taboo-ridden
field. the recourse to psychologisms and mysticisms contained in this
formula documents man's initial difficulties when relating to magic,
as he has developed a constitutional preference for suppression, evasion
and compensatory conjurations when confronted with a complex world
and reality.<P>

From its very inception, the permanent presence of paramount forces
of nature which man's claim to life has to face in the polar region,
disavows any refuge to tests of endurance, training, exercises or even
vacant space for trial and error, for experimentation and even instruction
in the conventional sense. with winter temperatures ranging from -45xc to
-70xc (minus 49xf to minus 94xf) for four to six months in the year,
intensified by wind speeds beaufort 3 to 11, accompanied by an extremely
low humidity and a minimum of three sunless months per year, the small
remaining span of time can leave but scarce and far too little scope for
the growth and bloom of survival resources.<P>

Obviously, such unsurmountable and merciless circumstances attendant
to sheer human existence in theses climes demand unexampled qualities of
the development and exertion of man's magic. thus, a magic elementary,
innovative and consequently highly intelligent, becomes the most obvious
and self-evident requirement. its main characteristics are sobriety and
efficacy, for the conditions of its evolution and practical circumstances
leave no scope for games, sentiments or the temporary decline into a bland
consumer's attitude. therefore, an improvised formula within this context
could read: "magic is the art of being able to do without aid,
embellishment and conditions in the course of achieving to one's
interests."<P>

It is only logical that translating such a clear-cut, uncompromising
craft and the highly sophisticated and most sensitive of sciences
inseparably linked with it, into our comparably soporific social
environment with all its pretensions, complexes and diversions, in a
teachable form must meet with considerable difficulties. certainly, this
magic is more practicable and efficient than everything else. but it is
for this very reason that it also invokes fear and disconcert within those
souls orientated towards ready consumption and essentially content with
the current status quo.<P>

The book, "ice magic", finally clears the path towards a practical and
theoretical introduction to this demanding magical art which subscribes to
efficacy alone. it makes itself available for understanding, examination
and personal practice by well-defined laboratoria, a reasonable processing
of experiences, stories and traditions and last but not least by the
systematical examples corresponding to this magic, of its transposition
into our cultural and environmental realms.<P>

To take one example: the author's instructed attempt to employ the
ambit of a different and consequently redirected bio-organization
with the objective of mastering enormous difficulties by traversing
the limitations and contingencies/ possibilities of a bird, left him
with the distinct impression of actually having been a certain bird.
in accordance with his possessive bents, the question became unavoidable,
whether he could not become a bird for a longer, yet limited period
of time (and thus, surely, even more tangibly). however, the reply
was prompt to come: "are you really willing to trade your possibilities
and your point of departure now?" faced with the clearly outlined
experience and the most tightly tautened contrast he realized immediately
that this was not his pursuit. the ensuing question, whether he would
now easily be able to overcome those tremendous difficulties which
claimed and restricted his cardinal attention and to leave them behind,
placed no demand on confirmation. he knew.<P>

It is owing to his preoccupation with ice magic and its bearers that
the author has primarily attained to a freedom of individual, untrammeled
and socially uninterlaced uninhibitedness only truly developable now.
he understands this uninhibitedness as a consequence and a presupposition
of that vast field of magical skill which, however, commonly hides
itself behind the horizon of conventional magical hopes and efforts.
it is only the preeminence of individual emancipation and the fulfillment
of desires which, to his present knowledge, grant those premises free
of stricture and retroaction, to share abilities, knowledge and power
with others and to push them far beyond their limits. however, he
is certain that it is only on the basis of individual acceptance that
the way is clear towards alliances however limited and temporary,
but reliable. assiduous friendships will then be no longer the product
and object of wishing and pure expectation but rather a growing, logically
established chance and possibility.<P>

The spirit carrying and stimulating ice magical practice in its
most considerate and freedom-loving manner may be best described by
the following small anecdote.<P>

Dating back to the turn of the century and before, several attempts
were made to settle the tribes of the lapps (samer) by offering them
land, obviously with the goal of integrating them into the predominant
social order and to make them as governable and controllable as everyone
else. without being clearly aware of the social and political dimensions
and impact of these settlement designs, it was a samer himself who
succintly pointed towards the enslavement and hazards entailed with
these offers of settling down. the proposal to settle him and his
clan permanently along with dwellings, farmsteads and agriculture,
while taking into account their traditional way of life by guaranteeing
that, following their former life of unrestricted and unentangled
moving about, their future homesteads should keep a minimum distance
to the next settlement or any neighbouring houses of at least 5 kilometer
(3.25 miles), met with his spontaneous and apprehensive comment. "how,"
so he demanded of the people in charge, "can one expect human beings
to live in such close vicinity with others?"<P>

Finally, an ice magical manifesto can be introduced along with the
book, whose sole design is to provide encouragement and suggestions
for those people who relate to the pursuit of freedom, expertise and
growth in magic to organize, or, at the very least, emancipate themselves
for the furtherment of their individual research without the jeopardies
involved in the aberrations and derangements of power politics - and
without therefore sooner or later being fettered hand, foot, soul
and spirit only to be thrown back consequently in their quest. the
ice magical manifesto will show real and feasible possibilities of
manifesting this spirit, provided appropriate interest is given.<P>
