<A NAME="abstract"><FONT COLOR=FF0000><CENTER>ABSTRACT</FONT COLOR=FF0000></CENTER><BR>


        <I>The unprecedented growth of the World Wide Web signals the
emergence of new forms of communication in the so called Age of
Information. Social groups are reevaluating the manners in which they
conduct relationships and form organizations. Religions are no
exception. Many faiths have online sites where members and nonmembers
can gather facts about the group's beliefs, history, and locations of
worship. Groups utilize electronic forms of communication like e-mail or
newsgroups that bridge the distance between members. Audience cults, a
term used by Stark and Bainbridge in <B><I>The Future of Religion</B></I>, are
dispersed, unorganized religious groups. Three will be the focus of this
paper: Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius, and the cults of
Cthulhu. I have attempted to show that the 'members' of these groups are
actively involved in the construction of the World Wide Web. Due to
their intimate affinity for the computer interface and lack of interest
in traditional organization, these audience cults are better categorized
as neophilic irreligions, diffuse groups of individuals committed to chaos and the unfamiliar that find meaning in supernatural forces embedded in
parodies of conventional faiths.  These irreligions construct social space and provide meaning for, instead of retreating from, the confusion and
unpredictability so rampant in cyber communication. These groups provide
members with ultimate meaning and general compensators that are in
tandem to what the Web, and more generally, the Information Age, is all
about. </I><BR><BR>

        <FONT SIZE=-1>"Our cause is a secret within a secret, a
secret that only another secret can explain; it
is a secret about a secret that is veiled by a
secret."<BR><BR>

- Ja 'far as-Sadiq, 6th Imam, quoted in Rev.
Karl Musser, Episkopos of the Cartographer's
Conspiracy Cabal's signature file
(alt.discordia: 15 Sep. 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        "We all chip in, see? We get these cameras of our own,"
Hal Phillips types on alt.discordia, an internet newsgroup
(17 Sep. 1996). "We spy on police headquarters all the time.
We just take turns, rotating shifts, time. Nothing illegal,
see." Hal is hoping to revive a pastime of the 'Diggers,' an
anarchist group active in the 1960's. "We just take turns,
rotating shifts, sitting outside various police-related
buildings and filming through the window, telling them it's
just in case we ever need to know what was happening in
there." Hal is a member of Discordianism, a free-wheeling
religious group bent on exploiting and manipulating as much
chaos and disorder as it can muster (Adler: 1985, 332).
"Then we trade shifts," he continues. "And take the tapes
home with us. If we organize it, we can actually pull it
off. The best weapon," Hal finishes, "is that which is used
against you."<BR><BR>
        On another newsgroup, alt.slack, Reverend Unibomber
posts (9 Sep. 1996), "Well...aside from the fact that I
couldn't understand half of what was happening due to the
fact that it all went by so QUICKLY, I can honestly say that
last night's devival on another.net was a success." The
Reverend (an online pseudonym) is speaking of the weekly
on-line 'meetings' of the Church of the SubGenius, an
unpredictable, in-your-face religious group that promises to
trounce all "false prophets and faiths" (Stang, 1996) that stand in the way of their
teachings. He concludes, "If I remember correctly, (which I
probably don't, but oh, well...) about 30 or 40 people
showed up during the course of the evening. All of them
throwing verbal assaults at one another AT THE SAME TIME!
CHAOS! CHAOS! But, a GOOD chaos."<BR><BR>
        More clicks of the mouse brings up alt.horror.cthulhu.
Tenebrous, a cool-headed newsgroup aficionado introduces the
'Aeon of Cthulhu Rising': "By the same token, those
initiates of the Esoteric Order of Dagon who are working
towards the Opening of the Gate of Yog-Sothoth must be
prepared to undertake this most dangerous descent into the
Abyss of Daath (the so-called 'false knowledge') in order to
activate these formulae effectively" (Tenebrous, 22 Nov.
1996) Tenebrous can be called a member of the cult of
Cthulhu, a group worshipping a misanthropic God chained
"beneath the waves" (Lovecraft, 1992) which will eventually
("when the stars are right") wipe out humanity and reclaim
earth once again (Alquier, 1996). Howard Phillips Lovecraft,
a pulp horror writer in the 1920's, invented Cthulhu. Both
the author and his Gothic creations have been raised to
a prophetic level over the years. Tenebrous
writes, "In his pivotal Mythos tale, 'The Call of Cthulhu,'
Lovecraft has adumbrated the first portents of this
return..." ( 22 Nov. 1996)<BR><BR>
        The above messages appear on newsgroups catering
to three quirky, unorthodox, and downright odd religious
groups. The Web in general, and newsgroups in particular,
are mobilizing these new religious movements in ways
never comprehended. At one time, these groups would wreak
the havoc and chaos they worship in localized spheres.
Cyberspace is bridging the gaps between small groups and
transforming the clusters into national movements. It is
doing this without any of the rules commonly associated with
the institutionalization of groups. Members of
Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius, and the Cthulhu
cult abhor conventional social groupings, methods of
organization, and hierarchies. The Web has none of these. It
is a wild no-man's land, or, "an additional parallel:...the
nineteenth-century American frontier" (Burstein and Kline:
1995, 8). The Web is electronic in form, post-modern in
spirit, and altogether chaotic. No wonder members like Hal
Phillips, Reverend Unibomber, and Tenebrous thrive in the
virtual forum offered by the Web. They worship Chaos. They
are committed to Chaos. But, like the Reverend stated in his
post..."GOOD chaos."<BR><BR>
        How do religious groups that thrive on chaos create and
maintain solidarity among members? Do they even wish to?
What does solidarity mean to these groups? What about
beliefs, morals, and loyalty? Members, if they can be called
that at all, hold conventional ways of life in disdain,
including 'traditional' conceptions of solidarity and
commitment. They forage for creativity and discord in
conversation, action, and belief. They spread pluralism and
walk the edge of social fragmentation. Post-modernists in
action, Discordians, SubGenii and Cthulhuvians are
constructing global on-line social realities that mirror the
unpredictable local worlds they live in off-line.<BR><BR>
        These global social realities are being molded through
the medium of the computer screen. Whole worlds in the shape
of bits and bytes are constructed in the name of these
groups' beliefs and tenets. This social reality is
cyberspace: a surreal, nonempirical world that is growing at
an accelerated pace in many social environments.<BR><BR>
        Cyberspace has its own laws, rules, language, morals,
etiquette, and structure...though almost all of them are
violated at some time or another, making way for constant
innovation and change. The individuals putting together
cyberspace find power in the fact that they are the dominant
order in this brave new world. They hold the keys to its
creation, maintenance and destruction. Though, like anyone
in power, they know that their world can retaliate in the
shape of viruses, other 'cyberconstructionalists,' or sheer outage of
electricity.<BR><BR>
        Thus, they recognize that power in cyberspace, and the
order that arises from it, can disappear as quickly as it
arrived. The social reality of cyberspace is chaotic and
utterly unpredictable. Individuals involved in cyberspace
find meaning and establish culture in the gods and beliefs
of Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius and the cults
of Cthulhu. Like cyberspace, these religious groups are
built (and indeed thrive) on chaos.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>THIS INCREDIBLE NEW FAITH, AUTHORIZED TO BLASPHEME

(Stang, 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        They are referred to as 'joke religions' or 'parodies'
on-line. Their deities are a smorgasbord of kaleidoscopic
imagery: a Goddess of Discord, an insanity-wreaking
cephalopod, and a pipe smoking, drill equipment salesman.
Beliefs can be summed up in a number of Zen-like sayings:
"Orthodoxy is the only heresy," "Don't believe what you
read," or "Cthulhu loathes you." Their members are bound
with a mysterious code borne out of new worldviews
incorporating technology and underground cultures. The
origins of Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius, and
the Cthulhu cultists are as unusual as the gods and
goddesses they worship.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>The human race will begin solving it's problems
on the day that it ceases taking itself so
seriously. To that end, POEE proposes the
countergame of NONSENSE AS SALVATION.<BR><BR>

-The Principia Discordia (1994: 74)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        An important concept behind these groups should be
dealt with before beginning an investigation of their
origins: the "ha ha only serious" mentality of the members,
their scriptures, and their beliefs. The Graz University of
Technology define "ha ha only serious" in their "Hacker
Lexicon" as,<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>A phrase (often seen abbreviated as HHOS) that
aptly captures the flavor of much hacker
discourse. Applied especially to parodies,
absurdities, and ironic jokes that are both
intended and perceived to contain a possibly
disquieting amount of truth, or truths that are
constructed on in-joke and self-parody. Indeed,
the entirety of hacker culture is often
perceived as ha-ha-only-serious by hackers
themselves; to take it either too lightly or
too seriously marks a person as an outsider...
(22 Nov. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>


        Graz University uses the term to describe hackers'
perceptions of the social environment, but goes on to apply
it to the members of the members of the Church of the
SubGenius, Discordianism, and the cults of Cthulhu. A "ha ha
only serious" mentality resides in many of the postings on
each of the group's newsgroups. There is a fine line (and it
is drawn in each group with various labels) between those
who "get it" and those who don't.<BR><BR>
        In sociological circles, these groups typically are not
researched, due mostly to the jeopardy one faces in studying
"nonsense." The "ha ha only serious" worldview has not yet
been considered as a socially learned skill. Until it is,
groups like the Church of the SubGenius, the Discordians and
the Cthulhuvians will not be taken seriously as subjectss of
study. In essence, the "joke" will continue until the groups
engage in activity that merits traditional attention placed
upon them, either in the media or in academia.<BR><BR>

In his house in R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits

- from "The Call of Cthulhu," by H.P. Lovecraft
(1992: 120)</FONT SIZE=-1><BR><BR>

        It is appropriate, in a conventional sense, to begin
with H.P. Lovecraft and his offspring, Cthulhu. Theirs is
the earliest appearance, at least in terms of the history
timeline accepted by most. The author introduced his oozing
monstrosity in 1928 in Weird Science (Alquier, 1996), one of
a slew of pulp magazines spewing out horror and what was to
become science fiction. Lovecraft was a reclusive author; he
had already been divorced and was back living with his aunts
in Rhode Island when "The Call of Cthulhu" was published
(Alquier: 1996). He stuck to himself. He didn't get out
much, and his mind was as curious as the strange and
horrible fiction that emerged from it. Philip A. Shreffer,
in The H.P. Lovecraft Companion, writes<BR><BR>

        <FONT SIZE=-1>Lovecraft was a fairly hard-boiled
scientific materialist who tended not to believe
in what could not be measured or perceived
sensorily. But, at the same time, he had a deep
sensitivity to the horrific qualities of
antiquity, an understanding that the further
back into history he could trace the patterns of
human belief and behavior, the further he could
remove his fiction from the known. And in
approaching the antique unknown, he felt, the
easier it is to stimulate fear.<BR><BR>
        This is why so many of Lovecraft's tales
root themselves in a mythos of unseen and
undimensioned monsters that existed before the
advent of man on earth, or else involve fantasy
lands that are at once strange and familiar,
often having derivative place names, like
Sarnath, which is an archeological site in India
(1985: 37)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        Cthulhu was a moderate hit among consumers of the pulp
magazine (Alquier, 1996). Most readers preferred action-
packed tales of two-fisted monsters and buxom babes in
tear-away clothing. Lovecraft's myths had neither. He
describes Cthulhu in the twisted pages of his short story:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid
outline, but with an octopus-like head whose
face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-
looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore
feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing,
which seemed instinct with a fearsome and
unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated
corpulence...(Lovecraft, 1992: 129)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

Lovecraft's mythology is rooted in insanity, fear, and
darkness. His Gods arrived on Earth eons ago, and after
ruling for millions of years, are now resting, or are
imprisoned in various space/time continuums. In his stories,
characters inadvertedly unearth these misanthropic deities,
which inevitably leads to insanity or death. Cthulhu was no
exception. A gigantic, dripping horror who "lay dreaming,
but not dead" (Lovecraft, 1992: 124) beneath the waves of
the Pacific ocean, Cthulhu conjured up Biblical visions of
Leviathan, Jonah's whale, and the Devil. The story would
become one of Lovecraft's most famous ventures into the
mythos he constructed. Lovecraft died of syphilis in 1938, a
hermit finding solace only in his dark creations (Loukes,
1996).<BR><BR>
        His writings would lay dormant for decades. Some
interested parties compiled and published collections of
his works in the 1960s and 1970s but it was the decade of
the 1980s that exhumed Lovecraft, freed Cthulhu from his
watery prison, and incited rabid interest in both (Gaiman,
in Lovecraft, 1992: preface). This can be credited to a
number of sources. Stephen King's enormously popular
fiction (see 1981, and especially 1983) were often mass
marketed derivations of Lovecraft's work. Many people saw
more of Lovecraft through King (and other heirs to his
throne of Gothic horror) than they did in his own works.
King's novels paved the way for a re-released deluge of
Lovecraft's work. Second, a move in fashion towards Gothic-
toned clothing, make-up and attitude influenced a small
portion of youth in the 1980's (Fine, 1984: 274). This
Gothic attitude was sponsored by, in large part, authors
like Lovecraft. Finally, Chaosium Inc. published the role-
playing game, Call of Cthulhu. The game sells thousands of
copies a year (Appel, 1996), and its  spin-off products
have been doing well also.<BR><BR>
        From these humble beginnings, the various cults of
Cthulhu have spawned new role players, avid interest in
Lovecraft's literature, and a number of individuals and
groups who believe that Cthulhu is real and that Lovecraft
the prophet knew it all along. What it all boils down to is
that Cthulhu is returning eventually, and he is going to
destroy humanity. This comforts most Cthulhuvians. The ones
who aren't comforted will go to all ends describing the
fruitlessness of escape, or will simply flash a cybersmile
[:)], and leave an empty space in their newsgroup message.
It's timely, apocalyptic chaos that reveals the fear of the
unknown in all of us.<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Before the beginning was the Nonexistent Chao,
balanced in Oblivion by the perfect
Counterpushpull of the Hodge and the Podge.<BR><BR>

- The Principia Discordia, 'Bible' of the
Discordians, (1994: 44)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        Following a chronological pattern, Discordianism is up
next. Discordianism originated in 1957 at a bowling alley in
southern California (Malaclypse the Younger, 1994: 7-8).
Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill allegedly experienced the
cessation of the time/space continuum in a bowling alley for
a few seconds, and reached a state of enlightenment. When
everything returned to normal, they sat down and formulated
a reason: chaos. Soon afterwards, the two published a book,
the Principia Discordia. In it, they describe the situation
that prompted the revelation:<BR><BR>

        <FONT SIZE=-1>Just prior to the decade of the nineteen-
sixties, when Sputnik was alone and new, and
about the time that Ken Kesey took his first
acid trip as a medical volunteer; before
underground newspapers, Viet Nam, and talk of a
second American Revolution; in the comparative
quiet of the late nineteen-fifties, just before
the idea of RENAISSANCE became relevant...<BR><BR>
        Two young Californians, known later as
Omar Ravenhurst and Malaclypse the Younger, were
indulging in their habit of sipping coffee at an
allnight bowling alley and generally solving the
world's problems. This particular evening the
main subject of discussion was discord and they
were complaining to each other of the personal
confusion they felt in their respective lives.
"Solve the problem of discord," said one, "and
all other problems will vanish." (1994: 7)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        The next evening, one of the young men had a dream.
Eris, the Greek goddess of discord visited him in his sleep,
saying, "I am chaos. I am the substance from which your
artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with
which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am
chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free" (1994:
8-9). Principia Discordia, and the belief structure
surrounding it, revel in the discord caused by Eris who
started the Trojan War when, perturbed at not being invited
to a gala of the Gods, threw a golden apple into the crowd
of deities On the apple was inscribed the word kallisti, or
"to the fairest." Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite bickered over
who should possess the apple, and eventually Paris made off
with Helen after choosing the Goddess of Love (Lee, 1996).<BR><BR>
        Eris, according to Thornley and Hill, has been causing
havoc since the 'beginning' (1994: 55). After the first run
of the Principia Discordia, cabals centering on the worship
of Eris began appearing in the San Francisco Bay area.
Through the second and third run of the book (all by various
publishers), more cabals appeared across the United States.
Margot Adler writes, "Discordians and Erisians are very much
present in the Pagan community today. They make their
presence known at Pagan festivals, and there are several
journals with a Discordian point of view" (1985: 336). Some
were small, others only had a member or two. None could be
considered great in number. Today, there are over thirty
different groups advertising their activities on the Web and
inviting others to join the ranks of the 'Apple Corps.'<BR><BR>
        As well as a revival of esoteric Greek and Roman
mythology, Discordianism is a "self-subverting Dada-Zen for
Westerners" (Buxton, 1996).  Members revel in the mysteries
of Eris while often harboring curiosity and fear of a
millennia-long war between the discord of their Goddess and
the authoritarian order of a secret society, the Illuminati.
They hold the pineal gland to be the highest of all parts of
the human body: it is there that all change takes place.
Crucial to their belief structure is the hodge-podge, or
Sacred Chao, a symbol similar to the yin-yang that
characterizes the twisting relationship of chaos and order. <BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>YES -- AFTER ALL THESE CENTURIES of organized
"belief" -- a religion that finally comes out
and admits that "IT" CAN'T BE SAID because "IT"
IS WHAT IS BEING SAID AND DOING THE SAYING AT
THE SAME TIME.<BR><BR>

- Church of the SubGenius Pamphlet #2, Page 3
(Stang: 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        The Church of the SubGenius is a "mutant offshoot of
Discordianism," (Graz University, 1996) founded in Dallas,
Texas. It was created by 'Reverend' Ivan Stang in 1981 as a
spoof on fundamental Christianity. Instead of God as an
almighty force, Stang puts the spotlight on the individual.
The Church makes grand claims (evident in two of the above
quotes from its ubiquitous pamphlets distributed across many
American College campuses) about the universe, society, and
people who have "bought into the Conspiracy" (Stang, 1996).<BR><BR>
        Stang and the other SubGenii focus on individuals who
are different, who stand out from the crowd. The SubGenius
Pamphlet #1 asks readers, "DO PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE STRANGE?
DO YOU??...THEN YOU MAY BE ON THE RIGHT TRACK!
'UNPREDICTABLES' ARE NOT ALONE AND POSSESS AMAZING HIDDEN
POWERS OF THEIR OWN!" (Stang: 1996) And later asks, "Are You
Abnormal? THEN YOU ARE PROBABLY BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE!"
The Church appeals to elitists and losers, individuals of
the same coin who feel too different to 'join up or die.'
Stang uses this quality to pool these people under the term
SubGenius. SubGenii, Stang writes, are part of "A SPAZZ-
CHURCH OF MACHO IRONY!!!" (Stang, 1996) <BR><BR>
        They also recruit from the ranks of the angry youth who
are tired of the rampant institutionalization taking place
in the United States (Stang: 1996). The Church of the
SubGenius has as its 'host' the mysterious quality of slack,
or "something for nothing." Until we don't "have to work for
living," the SubGenii will battle the forces of the
'Conspiracy' (Stang, 1983). The Church grew, due in part to
Stang's unusual "gift for promotion" (Graz University:
1996). Yet it was the 'graven image' of J. R. "Bob" Dobbs,
the smiling salesman (and deity of the SubGenii) and his
theory of slack that propelled the Church forward in terms
of membership growth and prevalence in a variety of social
groups. Dobbs, a straight laced, pipe smoking icon of the
1950's, was a drill equipment salesman until he discovered a
flying saucer in his backyard. Dobbs became relatively
infamous in the area where he worked. <BR><BR>
        Stang chose "Bob" as the omniscient symbol for slack
that the Church of the SubGenius espouses in published
material, paraphernalia like bumper stickers, and web pages.
The SubGenii pride themselves on their lack of a work ethic
or an appreciation for the status quo, and consider those
who possess such an appreciation to be "Pinks" or "Normals,"
both derisive term. The SubGenii utilize mantra-like sayings
that are part of their "Brain Toolkit" to show that
"everything you know is true" (Stang, 1992: 2), a statement
that is opposite to the Discordian sentiment, "everything
you know is wrong" (Malaclypse the Younger, 1994: 34).
Members gather together infrequently for "creative
consumption" parties, "short duration marriages," or rap
sessions that lead to new ideas for the religion's goals.
Most consider themselves to be a Pope or Reverend of
something or other, a quality of elitism that inhibits
organized group activity. Preferably, the SubGenii subvert
surrounding environments on a collective level, by
communicating ideas on-line and in print.<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>I (Thaddeus "navarone" Gunn) am putting

eventually garnered 23 responses of approval
(alt.slack: 15 Oct. 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        When the groups gather together physically, it is
either through close friendship networks, disordered
meetings replicating the blaze of cyber-messages on the Web,
or vast Dionysian festivals that are driven by the will of
chaos. The groups claim to have gathered for years outside
the on-line community. Discordians state that they hold
"Discordian Days Out" where members romp on highway exits
blocking traffic for miles. The Church of the SubGenius hold
X-Day Drills in anticipation of the world ending. Cthulhu
cults engage in a number of activities: arcane magical
rites, brooding role playing games, and discussion groups
that support the eerie Lovecraft tradition. These gatherings
(and others like them) still occur on a local level.
Although some of the activities are questionable (for
instance, the Discordian Days Out) others have been seen by
other researchers (like SubGenius devivals), or are public
affairs (like Cthulhuvian gaming conventions).<BR><BR>
        It is the Web, however, that has propelled the groups
to a whole new level of contact and networking. The Web
allows anyone to exchange ideas with anyone. These cults are
no exception. The groups communicate beliefs, thoughts, and
ideas via messages on websites and newsgroups on the
Internet. The Web has provided the groups a crazed, ever-
changing forum in which to gather. The Web complements the
ideals and practices espoused by members since their
inceptions. In essence, the Web and the newsgroups amplify
the locally constructed, loosely organized organizational
structures and beliefs that had existed before their
expansion (Burstein and Kline, 1996: 54).<BR><BR>
        Discordianism has spread localized chaos by inflicting
SNAFUs (Situation Normal All Fucked Up) and OMs (Operation
Mindfuck) on taken-for-granted social norms. Now they can
inflict more discomfort by teaching thousands who read their
messages and sites the 'Garfinkling' techniques that have
made them famous in such areas as the San Francisco Bay
Area. Newsgroup participants arrive from Ohio, Florida, even
Great Britain. The Church of the SubGenius recruits heavily
in Dallas and along the West Coast. With the Web, their pool
of 'converts' grows a hundred fold. The cults of Cthulhu,
born in the mind of a pulp writer has a well established
community on the Web. Lovecraft's writings are explained,
members can critique ideas, and discover secrets about the
magical tomes mentioned in Cthulhuvian texts. The local has
become the global.<BR><BR>
        The unique nature of growth and expansion of these
groups in recent years can be credited largely to the
cyberspace movement and the individuals involved in its
creation. These groups find life in cyberspace, as opposed
to established groups who use the Web and its many facets to
simply enrich the already existing movement. The Web is the
lightning rod for disparate non-joiners who abhor stability
and feed off of discord, mayhem and anarchy (Slatalla and
Quittner, 1995: 3). To purists, this is what the Web is all
about. It is no wonder these individuals are attracted to
such religions as the Church of the SubGenius, Discordianism
and the cults of Cthulhu.<BR><BR>
        How does chaos give meaning to the lives of these
individuals? Better: why is it the center of worship? Chaos
is often used in the prophetic mode to derail dominant
orders. This is happening in cyberspace as different parties
vie for control of the bits and bytes and how to use them. <BR><BR>
        In the case of these religious groups, chaos becomes
the beacon of rebellion (Michaels, 21 Nov. 1996). The
religions, in essence, form a belief structure and
philosophy around the concept of chaos. They are intent on
disrupting the order they claim has stagnated society.<BR><BR>
        The members accomplish this task by preparing and
conducting "inversion rituals" that parody traditional
rituals and beliefs found in more established faiths. These
"inversion rituals" aim to deconstruct what members claim to
be mindlessly ordered social reality. Once deconstructed,
the pieces can be put back together in a playful fashion.
This tactic is thoroughly post-modern and has been used in
artistic circles for decades (Sarup, 1993 and Kumar, 1995).<BR><BR>
        Thus, chaos compels individuals of these three groups
to find new meaning in old symbols. In reveling in the
unholy and discordant throes of chaos, members perceive
these rituals as unshackling tools; rites which allow them
to fully explore the creative, innovative, unpredictable,
and novel.<BR><BR>
        This playful nature extends even to the very worlds
they are constructing online. When members critique the
onslaught of goverment regulation and capitalistic
tendencies on the Internet, they, in essence, are critiquing
the system from within. They have created this world, and
now they are in a constant batle with it; always hoping to
push it further before it can be entrenched by more ordered
social circles.<BR><BR>
        Members of the three religious prosper in these ongoing
"inversion rituals." The rites keep them active in their
community, in their religion, and prompt them to continually
voice support or disdain for ideas that cross their path. In
a way, these individuals are audience members in a digital
age. In another, they are active participants in a medium
that has not been fully explored.<BR><BR>

- from an interview with Robert Anton Wilson,
author, futurist, guerilla ontologist (Cruzio,
1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        Are these groups in fact religions? They have beliefs
in supernatural forces, are organized to the extent that
they can be named, and are committed to chaos. They've been
around for awhile and have enough resolution among members
to keep dialogue, gatherings and literature in the public
domain. Yet they frown upon stability, spit upon dogma, and
continue to change scripture held 'sacred' by members. They
gather together, but never at periodic sessions (except on
the Web, which is itself not fixed in any spectrum except
the use of programming language). Anyone can declare
themselves a Reverend in either Discordianism or the Church
of the SubGenius. Anyone can take the risk of reciting
arcane magickal spells in the name of Cthulhu. In the end,
it is the groups themselves that decide whether they're
religions. <BR><BR>
        Discordians and SubGenii are quick to declare
religiosity (see Kumar, 23 Aug, 1996; Phillips, 21 Oct.
1996; and Sutter, 21 Aug., 1996). The cults of Cthulhu are
slightly less apt to do so, since they are fragmented into a
variety of classifications, though there are a number of
groups who are open in their faith in Cthulhu and his
minions beyond the stars (see Damerall, 1996). Due to the
snarled, disperse nature of worship, some sociologists will
classify the three groups as audience cults (Stark and
Bainbridge, 1979: 126 and 1985: 26).<BR><BR>
        Audience cults are part of a model of new religious
movements established by Rodney Stark and Bill Bainbridge in
1979. The authors divided new religious movements into three
categories: audience cults, client cults, and cult
movements. First and foremost, the authors asserted that
members of audience cults (and the cult leaders) simply
attended lecture circuit talks, never really participating,
and thus never finding (nor establishing) solidarity (1985:
210). "Three degrees of organization (or lack of
organization) characterize cults," they write. "The most
diffuse and least organized kind is an audience cult" (1985:
26). This broad category includes UFO conventions, astrology
column readers and devourers of occult literature. Without
organization, the authors declare, a religious group is no
more than an audience cult, an aggregate of individuals who
have only indistinct interests in common.<BR><BR>
        Discordians, SubGenii and the Cthulhu cultists demand a
category that does their way of living, manner of thinking,
and belief systems justice. Indeed, they do thrive on a
diffuse, unorganized form of worship. They originated in the
writings of a small number of individuals. But their
acceptance of new forms of communication prevalent in
computers today warrants an expansion of the term audience
cult that considers both their acceptance of novel types of
organization and the unpredictability of the Net and
communication in general. The term audience cult needs a
sibling for two reasons.<BR><BR>
        The first is the fact that The Future of Religion was
written in 1985, and was based on work published in the
Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion in 1979. Before
1988, the Web was being used by the military, the
government, and a small group of academics. Hardly anyone
knew about it or its potential. In fact, the Third Wave had
not even begun yet. Audiences lapped up written material and
attended lectures and seminars. And then moved on. It was
one-way communication. This is why commitment to a certain
group was nonexistent. The audience could simply get up and
leave when it was tired or bored. There were always other
audience cults to visit. The Web changed all this. It
introduced global two-way communication and it used the
computer monitor to incorporate all kinds of media into the
equation. Suddenly, the audience could talk back. The
audience became a dynamic, active force, instead of a
passive aggregate. <BR><BR>
        The second reason for a new term is what some parties
call the post-modern age. Post-modernity has changed many of
the ways Western society looks at social grouping,
organization, and solidarity (Sarup, 1993: 130). Krishan
Kumar writes, "The idea of a national culture and national
identity is assailed in the name of 'minority' cultures -
the cultures of particular ethnic groups, religious faiths,
and communities based on age, gender, or sexuality" (1995:
122). Zygmunt Bauman described the new social groupings of
individuals as a stream of water, lapping here and there,
and then moving on (1992: 180). There aren't any more social
classes. In their place are regional, local organizations
that are linked globally through technological communication
breakthroughs, like the Internet and the Web. <BR><BR>
        The grandfather of post-modernism, Lyotard states that
post-modernity "accepts and reworks the past, often in a
playful, parodic or affectionate form, rather than rejecting
it wholesale" (Kumar, 1995: 111). This quality in the groups
will become evident later in the paper. And Ihab Hassan has
declared that unlike modernity (which had as its focal point
'Authority'), post-modernity has 'Anarchy' (1995: 108).
Discordianism, the Church of the Subgenius and the cults of
Cthulhu embody this spirit. In a way, they have held the
chaotic flame high since their founding days, whether they
be fifteen, forty, or seventy years ago. <BR><BR>
        Now that the theories of post-modernity and the Web
have vindicated their unorthodox methods of organization and
solidarity, they have begun convalescing, growing out of the
term audience cult towards something new, active, dynamic. <BR><BR>
        These particular audience cults would be better defined
as <I>neophilic irreligions</I>. Neophilic, a term coined by
futurist Robert Anton Wilson (1975), refers to the quality
in individuals that accepts or relishes the 'new' or
unfamiliar by actively participating in its construction.
The neophile is not opposed to altering his belief
structure, or the organizational structure of his group, so
long as it aids in the dispersal of stagnation and eternal
truths (as they have been understood in modernistic terms).
Like post-modernity, a neophile "braces itself for a life
without truths, standards, and ideals" (Bauman: 1992, ix).<BR><BR>
        An irreligion uses the protocol of conventional (read
"established") religions to dismantle reality tunnels, or
singular perceptions of a lifeworld by disrupting norms and
social conventions. This is the playful, parodic nature of
post-modernity. Like architects and artists who define
themselves as post-modern, the neophiles would welcome this
term (and if not, at least act on the principles that are
currently in vogue). <BR><BR>
        Audience cults warrant this augmented definition for a
number of reasons, most of which are in response to Stark
and Bainbridge's definitions in The Future of Religion.
Stark and Bainbridge write that audience cults are "...even
less close to being religions" (1985: 209) than client
cults, and "membership remains at most a consumer activity"
(1985: 340). They assert that "[s]sometimes, audience cults
make rather grand claims about the nature of the world and
of the human species" (1985:209). They resolve that
"although each audience cult is far from being a religion,
collectively, they communicate a pale reflection of the
religious" (1985: 210) and that "[t]his interpretation may
explain why audience cults seldom solidify into cult
movements" (1985: 211).<BR><BR>
        To some extent, the characteristics detailed by the
authors are correct. However, the members of these diffuse
webs of individuals display attributes of cult movements,
albeit in novel ways unrecognized or unappreciated by
researchers who use previously established "cultic
templates" as gauges for new areas of study. First, the
irreligions are more organized than other audience cults
previously studied by the two sociologists (however, members
condemn the word 'organized,' preferring instead to appear
disorganized and diffuse). They establish weekly newsgroup
sessions, organize meetings where all members can voice
opinions, and allow individuals to express beliefs on
personal websites. <BR><BR>
Second, they provide unique ultimate
meanings for members, invalidating Stark and Bainbridge's
claim that they "communicate a pale reflection of the
religious" 91985: 210). The irreligions have a strong belief
system resting on metaphysical, deity-oriented mythology.
Third, there are general compensators that provide a
context, culture, and worldview for members. These
compensators, resting on the ultimate meaning systems
erected, are created by members, and determine their
behavior in far greater ways than the compensator "diffuse
hope" (1985: 210) proposed by the authors. Fourth, the
groups establish antagonistic ties with the surrounding
environment and conventional, or normalized, social and
religious groups. <BR><BR>
        The three groups find strength in the unpredictable
nature of communication, and thus, the social environment.
They activate religious and social change not in group
oriented services or rituals (although some members gather
for such events), but by proposing archetypal, ever-changing
reality loops backed with strange new imagery that capture,
confront, and cooperate with the new communication paradigm
emerging from and producing the Information Age. In this
way, they are audience cults. However, it is an appreciation
for new organizational structures, unpredictable deities and
beliefs, and a sense of competition with the surrounding
environment that make these three groups full-fledged cult
movements in the making.  <BR><BR>

































<A NAME="growth"><FONT COLOR=FF0000><CENTER>THE GROWTH OF THE WEB AND UNPREDICTABILITY IN
COMMUNICATION</FONT COLOR></CENTER><BR><BR>

        The groups were created long before the Web was
invented, but much of their recent growth can be attributed
to and correlated with the blossoming Web. There are as
many, if not more, web sites and newsgroup messages posted
for these irreligions than other established religions.
Although "web counters" are an imprecise measure of growth
(web designers can 'set' counters to any number they desire
when establishing a site), many individuals visit these
sites on a daily basis. <BR><BR>
        This, I contend, is because a majority of members in
these neophilic irreligions participate actively in the
construction of the Web and its many facets and attributes.
The Web is owned by no single entity, and no laws dictate
the design and quality of the gear that run it. The same
applies to the three groups researched for this paper.
'Members' of both groups (the Web community and the
irreligions) pride themselves on these characteristics.<BR><BR>
        Before discussing the three groups' roles on the Web
and in the Information Age in general, a brief discussion of
the Internet and communication are necessary in order to
provide a backdrop for these religions, and to illustrate
the relationship between ways the Internet functions and
members interact with others, both in the groups and out.<BR><BR>
        Despite the demise doomsayers have predicted for the
last four years, most agree that the Web is here to stay
(Ziegler, 1996: B1). It serves as a novel communication
device, binding groups of people together in a way never
thought of before: the computer interface. Comments like
"I'm talking a catastrophic collapse, which I'm pretty sure
will happen this year" (1996: B1) are evident in some
circles, but they are antithetical to the concept of the
Web. Netscape Communications Corp.'s chairman, Jim Clark
says, "It will get to the breaking point just like the phone
system has throughout time" (1996, B1) And then, he adds,
new service providers will add capacity to avoid losing
customers. The Web is controlled by no one, and thus will
probably always crash, but never burn.<BR><BR>
        The number of Web sites on the Internet has grown from
a few thousand five years ago to an estimated 50 million
today (See Ziegler and Burstein and Kline). These sites form
a conglomerate forum, a virtual marketplace of information
for users. Access to the forum is often slow, but it is
always there. It is this feature that makes the Web a new
form of social organization. The name World Wide Web
illustrates this attribute beautifully. A metaphor for a
spider's habitat, the Web is linked everywhere by hypertext,
a program used to design web pages.<BR><BR>
        Individuals are organizing themselves differently
because of the Web. Groups can form, gather, and disband in
a number of hours. E-mail, newsgroups and web sites make
group cohesion an immediate possibility. Groups have
realized they no longer have to physically gather in order
to bring about the social changes on their agenda. Loyalty
is judged in terms of availability and online conversation.
Those who get in the way of the group's greater goals are
flamed, killfiled, or shunned (Graz University, 1996).<BR><BR>
        These words are still alien to most social groups, but
they are part of the hacker vocabulary. Hackers created the
Web, e-mail, and the newsgroups that millions engage
everyday. The hacker, originally meaning "someone who made
furniture with an ax," (1996) is "a person who enjoys
exploring the details of programmable systems and how to
stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users who
prefer to learn only the minimum necessary" (1996). Another
definition from the Hacker Lexicon of Graz Technical
University: "One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of
creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations" (1996). <BR><BR>
        The factors of time and proximity in communication
networks are some of these limitations they have bested, or
continue to confront with zeal. Hackers worked on the radio,
telephone, and the television. Now they work on the
Internet, breaking down the hindrances space and time
present to communication networks.  <BR><BR>
        What they have created is an increase in the flow of
information. The social environment is experiencing a flux
of ideas due to the increased alacrity of messages that
technology affords. The hackers are responsible for this
(Slatalla and Quittner, 1995: 230). They are producing
technology at a far greater pace than most can keep up with.
This is the reason why the media and other labeling agents
have coined this period the "Age of Information." With this
opened faucet of information, however, comes, as futurist
Robert Anton Wilson states, social chaos (Cruzio, 1996). <BR><BR>
        Social chaos theory rests on the idea that as
communication increases in a system, chaos increases.
Discordians are proponents of this theory and 'disguise' it
in all of their literature. A number of scientists have
accepted chaos theory as the foundation for their work (see
Wheatley, 1994, Gell-Mann, 1993). Chaos Theory in
mathematics has been applied for a hundred years since the
work of Henre Poincare.<BR><BR>
        Its application in the social sciences is cutting edge
now, seeing that chaos theory disrupts linear models of
system analysis. Chaos theorists often focus on information
as a source of chaos in the social environment. Wilson
writes:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Information: A measure of the unpredictability
of a message; that is, the more unpredictable a
message is, the more information it contains.
Since systems tend to disorder (according to the
second law of thermodynamics), we can think of
the degree of order in a  system as the amount
of information in it (1979: 542).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        It is apparent that with the growth of the Web and the
frenzied work of programming hackers in the last few years,
the amount of order in the social environment has decreased,
and the amount of unpredictability and chaos has increased.
So, hackers have created more chaos and confusion in the
flow of information by making it easier to communicate. How
does this affect their worldview? Well, in many ways. Most
of which I experienced while conducting research into these
somewhat troublesome groups.<BR><BR>

(alt.slack: 24 Oct. 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        Researching the Web is both an exercise in futility and
an activity of fruitfulness. It is, as Burstein and Kline
write in Road Warriors, a no-man's land (1996). Better,
there's an every-man-for-himself mentality that governs the
medium. It can run harmoniously like a pure democratic
community, or erupt into an anarchic motley of 404 error
messages and electronic dead ends. The cyberworld of the
three irreligions embody both aspects. Their websites are
some of the most organized, beautiful, and extensive on the
World Wide Web. Their newsgroups are some of the discordant,
frustrating around. Their sites represent the well honed
ability at HTML coding and linking while the newsgroups they
participate in express the randomness that constitute their
worldviews. <BR><BR>
        The methodology used to collect data for this project
was as eclectic as the data itself. In a way, I was a
participant observer. In another, I was an infiltrator,
drawing the members out into the open, exposing their
beliefs and ideas about the religions they belong to.<BR><BR>
        May 1996 began the search for the secrets behind the
ironic and unconventional veils of the three irreligions. I
began exploring the byways of the Web, compiling information
on as many sites I could find that related to the three
groups. In hacker jargon, I was a lurker, an individual who
views a web site but offers neither praise nor criticism of
the content. Most people 'cruising' the World Wide Web are
lurkers. Hackers liken lurkers to mere television viewers.
They use this term with a tone of disdain and contempt. Most
hackers believe that the Web should be interactive. If you
stumble into a no-man's land, they reason, better be ready
to converse with the locals or other travelers.<BR><BR>
        But the Web allows lurkers to abound. Despite
historical records stored in bits and bytes inside hard
drives by bots (programs that collect and retrieve
information for users) most lurkers can go undetected in the
journeys around cyberspace. This is how I proceeded from May
to July of 1996.<BR><BR>
        I decided to "come out of the closet" to many of the
individuals participating in the groups near the end of the
summer. I contacted the webmasters (creators or maintainers
of the Web sites I visited) via e-mail to conduct interviews
and glean any information from them that wasn't apparent on
their sites.<BR><BR>
        Most responses were terse and to the point. Neophiles
don't trust researchers. They feel labeled, packaged for an
academic paper that'll categorize and box them. This is
something no neophile, and certainly no irreligion wishes
for. So I changed my approach in the beginning of September.
I joined the three major newsgroups introduced at the
beginning of the paper.<BR><BR>
        Newsgroups are like a Hollywoodized Old West Saloon.
There are the regulars who grunt over their cards, and stick
with others at their card table. These are the individuals
who post all the time, and end up having on-line
conversations at least three to four times a week. <BR><BR>
        There are the heroes in white Stetsons and spurs who
drop in, try to clean things up, and then move on after
meeting with failure (or death: read killfiled). On
newsgroups, this is the individual who hears about the ideas
of one of the irreligion, and tries to convince the regulars
that they have it all wrong, that they're steered the wrong
way (wrong beliefs, wrong attitude, etc.). They get
killfiled or shunned out of existence.<BR><BR>
        There are the young guys who don't necessarily want to
prove anything, want in on the card game but don't know the
rules yet. These are the infamous newbies, so called because
they are 'net babies who haven't learned the ropes of adult
life on the Web, or on a particular newsgroup. They blunder
into closed conversations, offend regulars, or stumble over
beliefs and customs. Most of the time they're escorted out
of the newsgroup to the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and
told to stay there until they've learned enough to post
something worth talking about.<BR><BR>
        Finally, there are the troublemakers who achieve the
reputation of "most hated poster." There are at least four
of these on alt.discordia, for example. They're a little
like parasites, and a lot like cancer. They gnaw away at
posted messages, and stick around even though they're
avoided. They're usually the regulars who get shot at the
Old West Saloon table after they get too annoying during
many hands of poker.<BR><BR>
        I decided to enter the newsgroups as a lurker, just to
get my bearings. I even read the FAQs for each of the three
groups before testing the waters. But I was pegged as a
newbie immediately on alt.horror.cthulhu and as a hero on
both alt.discordia and alt.slack. It might have to do with
the messages I posted. On alt.cthulhu:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Does anyone actually believe in Cthulhu? I have
seen the site for the Chaos Cult of Cthulhu
CCCXXXIII, but everything else seems to revolve
around his presence in role-playing games.</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>
On alt.discordia:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>I was handed a copy of the 'Principia Discordia'
yesterday and I decided to check out the
messages on the Discordian newsgroup.<BR><BR>

I don't get it. If you guys call yourselves a
religion, how can you foster commitment among
members if you like chaos so much? A faith is
built upon solidarity and stability, not discord
and strife.<BR><BR>

Most the messages I've read have to do with
flaming one another and contain snide comments.<BR><BR>

A faith needs to go further than this in order
to survive. There needs to be a place of
worship, a set service time and no tongue-in-
cheek irony behind all that you believe.<BR><BR>

The book was interesting, but it seems that the
Discordians won't last long if they keep telling
people 'not to join' or 'don't believe
anything.'<BR><BR>

The individual who handed me the copy of the
'Principia Discordia' also handed me a copy of
the Book of the SubGenius. I've decided to go
ahead and post a similar message at their
newsgroup.</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>
And on alt.slack:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>All right, I've posted with alt.discordia and
gotten a reply. But I need to ask the same
questions of alt.slack:<BR><BR>

I don't get it. If you guys call yourself a
religion, how can you foster commitment among
members if you encourage them "not to join."
I've read the Book of the SubGenius (it was
handed to me by someone who bought it, read it,
but still doesn't get it) and it says nothing
about gathering together, how to form solidarity
among members etc.<BR><BR>

A faith needs to provide stability and security
among its members, not spread discord, strife,
and confusion.<BR><BR>

How will you get anything done as a group if you
never gather together...join together?<BR><BR>

It seems to me Bob has a message but everyone on
this newsgroup is afraid to ask what it is
because "if you have to ask, you'll never know.<BR><BR>

I don't know, maybe I'm 'pink.' But it seems
that this group won't last long if it doesn't
plan regular meetings and establish bonds among
members.</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        Responses varied from the quote at the beginning of
this section to a friendly response that contained examples
of commitment among members, ideals to live up to, and
explanations of beliefs that are private testimonies to the
worldview of the members. Most responses from the
Discordians and SubGenii were flames. Most from the
Cthulhuvians were niceties. The flames came predominantly
from the regular card players (of the Old West Saloon
metaphor) and most kind responses from lurkers or
'irregularly posting' regulars. <BR><BR>
        The Web is full of incongruities. Because so many
different individuals and organizations participate in its
construction, the Web does not lend itself to many forms of
statistics. Even counting web sites to establish a
preponderance of a group is fruitless. Instead, what should
be noted is that the more sites a religious group has, the
more computer-oriented members it has. Web sites are
difficult to start for a number of reasons, including
knowledge of the computer and simple programming, time
drain, access to a server, and the monetary investment of a
computer, if one is not available for web site creation at
work or school. <BR><BR>
        What the following numbers describe is that there is a
correlation between people interested in computers and
people interested in the three irreligions. I conducted a
search on two different engines to tally the number of web
sites for a number of groups, including the three studied in
this paper. The other four groups were the Unification
Church, the Hare Krishnas, the Presbyterian Church, and the
Catholic Church. The two search engines were HotBot and
Metacrawler. Metacrawler is actually nine search engines in
one. So the total number of search engine was in actuality
ten. This means little, however, as webmasters can list
their web site many times with the same engine, thus getting
more 'hits' from users. For example, "Hacker Jargon," a
helpful site established by the Graz University of
Technology, establishes a link to a search engine for every
term listed. So it is apparent that numbers are always
skewed. But this tells us even more about the people
involved in the Church of the Sub Genius, the cults of
Cthulhu, and the Discordians. They know what they're doing
on the computer, and are getting people to their sites
through technological manipulation.<BR><BR>
        Here are the numbers of web sites mentioning or
dedicated to religious groups:<BR><BR>

<B><CENTER>Table 1: Number of Religious Organizations' Web Sites Listed
in Two Search Engines </B></CENTER><BR>
 The first number after the irreligions corresponds to the number of hits on Metacrawler, the second on HotBot.<BR><BR>

Church of the SubGenius:               65                   2440<BR>
Discordianism:                                    61                   1237<BR>
Cthulhu:                               80                  10173<BR>
Unification Church:                    53                   440<BR>
Hare Krishnas:                         64                   686<BR>
Presbyterian Church:                   93                   32063<BR>
Catholic Church:                       94                   91052<BR><BR>

        It is easy to see that one of the largest religious
faiths in the world, the Catholic Church, has only 29 more
sites than the Church of the SubGenius, 33 more than the
Discordians, and 14 more than the Cthulhu people.
Proportionately, results are skewed towards the irreligions.
Considering the number of people in the religion compared to
the tiny number of members in the three irreligions, it is
apparent that the irreligions are created by and recruit
heavily from, individuals interested in computers. In fact,
the ability to list web sites more than others is an ability
of hacking. <BR><BR>
        Metacrawler is a more reliable source of information;
HotBot, put together by the publishers of Wired magazine,
cites every web site that remotely mentions the term asked
for. HotBot's numbers echo Metacrawler's, albeit on a
massive scale. For instance, it is telling that the search
term "Cthulhu" turned up 10,173 times, while "Hare Krishnas"
only turned up 686 times. These three audience cults are
obviously cyber-oriented. Members use the web sites to
recruit, broadcast, and display their beliefs and interests
for their respective irreligion. They proselytize not
through ordinary means, but through complete proliferation
on the Web.<BR><BR>
        Newsgroups provide similar results. alt.discordia has
gone from 18 messages posted by 15 different people (from
November 1, 1995 to November 8, 1995)  to 416 people posting
1349 messages on the same dates in 1996. These messages are
a random assortment of ideas and beliefs focusing
predominately on Eris and the ideals of discord.<BR><BR>
        alt.horror.cthulhu has gone from 4 messages posted by 3
different people (from November 1, 1995 to November 8, 1995)
to 96 people posting 206 messages on the same dates in 1996.
Most messages revolve around H.P. Lovecraft's writings and
trivia about the Great Beast, although some talk of cult
activity abounds irregularly.<BR><BR>
         alt.slack has gone from 88 message posted by 53
different people (from November 1, 1995 to November 8, 1995)
to 323 people posting 1274 messages on the same dates in
1996. The Church of the SubGenius has even branched out,
using under.net and another.net to conduct Sunday night
"devivals." These impromptu, chaotic hours of message
postings function as a cyber-service free-for-all. Members
spend an hour hashing and rehashing beliefs each week with
the "elect." Individuals who are new to the Church are not
encouraged to participate until they are more fully immersed
in the group. The individuals participating in the
"devivals" mean business.<BR><BR>




















<A NAME="fragile"><FONT COLOR=FF0000><CENTER>THE FRAGILE WORSHIP OF CHAOS AND THE NUANCES OF
IRRELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS</FONT COLOR></CENTER><BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Protests of SubGenii being "non-joiners"
notwithstanding, there are regular meetings
every weekend on irc.another.net. Not to mention
the horrifying touring schedule Jesus is
planning for Stang in '97. What more do you
want?<BR><BR>

-Michael Townsend on alt.slack (26 Oct.,
1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius and the
Cults of Cthulhu were chosen because they exhibit
characteristics of Stark and Bainbridge's audience cult and
cult movement typologies. The groups are diverse and
unorganized (and choose to be so), provide ultimate meaning
and general compensators for members and have conflictual
relations with the surrounding environment. Although they
accept no formal dogma, they nevertheless accept what the
Discordians have called catma (Pieri, 1996), which is only
different from dogma in that it prods members to dedicate
themselves to the unfamiliar and novel. This blending of
characteristics makes it necessary to typify another kind of
religious organization: that of the neophilic irreligion.<BR><BR>
        The irreligions began as audience cults and would have
stayed as such (in terms of Stark and Bainbridge's model) if
not for the rise of post-modern thinking, a welcoming of the
irrational in society that has taken place for the last
thirty years and advancement in technology.<BR><BR>
        Each of these groups began with an individual
publishing for and speaking to audiences. Lovecraft wrote
pulp Gothic fiction like the story "Call of Cthulhu."
Thornley and Hill published the Principia Discordia. Stang
published The Book of the SubGenius and Revelation X (among
many others related to slack). However, due to the chaotic
mood and atmosphere that has prevailed and grown in numerous
circles in society, groups formed and rallied around their
writings. The literature took on life in the activity of
individuals who espoused the beliefs within the pages.<BR><BR>
        As post-modernity grew in scholarly circles, artistic
cabals, and marketing businesses, theses localized groups
spread, albeit slowly and in esoteric, hidden ways. The
neophiles in the groups wanted none of the organizational
tactics found in other cults at the time. They wanted
neither leaders nor institutionalized beliefs. The growing
trend toward communication as a commodity and the
Information Age in general validated their belief structures
and legitimated their manners of organization. <BR><BR>
        The Third Wave, or the Information Age heralded the
globalization of the beliefs of these localized, tiny
groups. The World Wide Web, the Internet, and other kinds of
technology allowed for organization outside the classical
paradigms (many of which are touted by Stark and
Bainbridge). The cybervillage allowed neophiles to define
their own reality in the terms they felt comfortable with.
In fact, because they were the individuals designing it,
they controlled the power to construct it the way they
wanted. <BR><BR>





















<A NAME="local"><FONT COLOR=FF0000><CENTER>LOCAL BEGINNINGS</FONT COLOR></CENTER><BR>

        Before the advent of the World Wide Web, the three
irreligion gathered in localized, regional clusters. These
local groups banded together under the auspices of the
literature published by the 'inventors' of the groups.
Groups stayed together only as long as new ideas emerged
from discourse and rituals. Once members had learned enough
about others in the groups, they moved on to other groups
centered on the same beliefs and literature or practiced the
irreligion on a solitary basis.<BR><BR>
        In this respect they can be considered audience cults.
Stark and Bainbridge state that audience cults are "the most
diffuse and least organized kind" (1985:209) of cult and
"there are virtually no aspects of formal organization to
these activities, and membership remains at most a consumer
activity" (1985:340) This is true of much cultic activity,
especially individuals and groups interested in the occult
and New Age beliefs and principles. Bainbridges work in the
early seventies at a spacecraft convention demonstrate the
previous characteristics. Stark and Bainbridge write that
"[p]ersons with a cult doctrine to offer rely on ads,
publicity, and direct mail to assemble an audience to hear
its lectures" (1985:25). <BR><BR>
        This scale (based on level of organization) is
meaningless when irreligions are included; they resist
organization in the sense Stark and Bainbridge have elevated
as a measure of success. These groups find stagnation and
obstacles in religions that function superbly on Stark and
Bainbridge's scale. <BR><BR>
        Thus the free-flowing, ever-changing structures of the
organizations must be seen as an asset to the irreligions
that focus on chaos and discord. They desire these
qualities. There are definitive groups that have persevered
through the years in each group. These local organizations
have continually redefined their reality and continually
reconstructed the worlds in which they live.<BR><BR>
        Discordian cabals are an example of this. The Eris
Society, the Apple Corps., the Cartographer's Conspiracy
Cabal and others like them are all examples of local
Discordian groups that have stuck it out and still produce
discord among members, just to, as one member put it,  "keep
things hot" (Burton: 1996).<BR><BR>
        The Church of the Subgenius has a central Foundation
based in Dallas, Texas that collects dues ($30 for a
lifetime membership), administers pamphlets and other
paraphernalia, and deals with legal hassles and the like.
Although the Dallas Foundation can be seen as a
headquarters, it is not viewed as such by members. Ivan
Stang and his base are but another facet of the widespread
and disperse SubGenii.<BR><BR>
        The cults of Cthulhu also have local branches which
base their activities on the creations of Lovecraft. Most
people involved in Cthulhu play the roleplaying game, 'Call
of Cthulhu,' published by Chaosium, Inc. There are others,
however, who view Cthulhu as a living (though asleep and
dreaming) God. The Esoteric Order of Dagon, the Yaddith
Lodge, the Chaos Cult of Cthulhu CCCXXXIII, the Miskatonick
Society and various Satanic groups believe in and worship
the Great Beast.<BR><BR>
        The quality all three irreligions have in common is
that they are composed of neophiles. Neophiles are 'non-
joiners,' individuals who abhor conventional means or
organization. This is exactly the reason why they band
together. Their organizational structure is based on not
organizing.<BR><BR>








<A NAME="solidarity"><FONT COLOR=FF0000><CENTER>SOLIDARITY AND COMMITMENT AMONG THE NEOPHILES</FONT COLOR></CENTER><BR>

        The responses to my inquiries concerning commitment and
solidarity on the newsgroups were, as stated above, wide in
range. Coupled with the literature, they revealed
individuals who feel strongly attached to groups in which
attachment is disparaged.<BR><BR>
        I will begin with conversations held at alt.slack
concerning commitment and solidarity among the Subgenii. The
SubGenius Pamphlet #2 published at SubSite, the "unofficial
home page" of the Church, states, <BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Technically, this organization cannot exist --
because it is composed of people who are not
joiners. The only thing most SubGenii have in
common is that they're ALL DIFFERENT -- and they
have NOTHING in common with the
C.O.N.S.P.I.R.A.C.Y.!!(Cliques of Normals
Secretly Planning Insidious Rituals Aimed At
Controlling You) The SubGenius, because it does
not "fit in," is actually better than anyone
else (Stang, 1996)!<BR><BR>

[emphasis in original document]</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>


Upon being asked about commitment, Dennis McClain wrote on
alt.slack:<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>You don't join the SubGenii. You either realize
you were one all along, or you don't, weren't
and aren't gonna be. That small portion that
gives the appearance of being organized exists
only to attract the new members so that they can
sign up, and according to Church dictates,
immediately schism.<BR><BR>

We are not about communions. We are about
epiphanies (27 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

Tarla responded to my post (detailed above in the research
section) on alt.slack:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>If you can get them to send in $30, they're
committed. We don't really encourage solidarity
among the members. This is why the Internet is
such a boon for the church. We can be members,
and yet not have to deal with each other on a
personal basis. Aside from the difficulties of
just getting groups of SubGenii together,
there's always the fact that most of us don't
agree with each other on just about everything
(27 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

In response to my statement, "A faith needs to provide
stability and security among its members, not spread
discord, strife, and confusion," Tarla wrote:<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>That's what YOU say. "Bob" says differently. How
can you be secure when you know you're leaving
the planet in just a couple of years? How do you
promote stability when stability is exactly what
you're fighting AGAINST (27 Oct. 1996)?</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

Asked, "How will you get anything done as a group if you
never gather together...join together?" Tarla responded:<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>We got you to consider us a "group" and half of
us are barely speaking to the other half. It's
magic (27 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

 She responded to my comment, "It seems that this group
won't last long if it doesn't plan regular meetings and
establish bonds among members."<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Well you'd be wrong then, Rick. We have no
regular meetings, we bond and then break and
then bond again. What keeps us here is mutual
insanity and inertia. I'll have been here two
years in Jan. and I'm relatively new to the
church (27 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        George, another poster on alt.slack responded to my
comments about bonds between members with classic, ironic,
tongue-in-cheek glibness:<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Establish bonds, huh?  Commitment, huh?
Establish bonds?  Hey.. now we're talking.  I've
heard curtain trimming cord recommended (was it
Friday who recommended it?), because it doesn't
have the wire center most other ropes do.<BR><BR>

I've heard that bungee is fun too, since it
allows a limited range of movement.  Hooke's Law
will never be the same again.<BR><BR>

look for the codicil.  they always fuck you with
that...(28 Oct. 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>
George finally got around to resonding seriously to my
message concerning commitment later in his posting:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Answer: we don't try to foster commitment.  But
you're confusing religion with group-thinking.
The two need not go hand-in-hand.  A person's
spiritual beliefs can and SHOULD be completely
personal, and not subject to alteration simply
because someone else said so.  The Church of
the SubGenius is one of the first religions
(palatable to western tastes) that emphasizes
what YOU believe, not what is written in the
official texts.<BR><BR>

There's a reason why the main book is called
"The Book of the SubGenius" and not "The Book
of 'Bob'": because this religion is ultimately
about YOU, not "Bob" (28 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE=-1><BR><BR>

I then told George, "I've read the Book of the SubGenius
(it was handed to me by someone who bought it, read it, but
still doesn't get it) and it says nothing about gathering
together, how to form solidarity among members etc." He
responded,<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Sure it does!  The chapter on Clenches and
schisms.  And that's the key here: schisming is
a primary concept, because the point is to
follow yourself and no one else.  Not even
Stang, except to buy some crap from him.<BR><BR>

No, the irony is not lost on us: following
instructions that say to not follow
instructions. The key out of the paradox is to
take the "not follow instructions" part to
heart: then if you choose to schism, or
whatever you care to do, it's because YOU want
to and you're ignoring everyone elses's
dictates.  THAT'S what they're trying to teach
(28 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

I then offered the idea that "[a] faith needs to provide
stability and security among its members, not spread
discord, strife, and confusion." He responded:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Untrue.  Many faiths shoot for this as a goal,
but that doesn't mean that all faiths have to
follow this model.  Consider that most faiths
make their followers feel "stable" and "secure"
by telling them that God loves them above all
others and they're going to get a big chocolate
chip cookie when they get to heaven.  All of
which, of course, is a lie, but at least it
makes the followers feel very happy ... makes
'em feel almost bovine, in fact. (Sorry,
Jools.)  But a *realistic* religion needs to
admit that there's a hell of a lot of
uncertainty in any metaphysical ramblings, and
this is one of the few religions that concedes
as much. Maybe it doesn't provide us with fuzzy
answers, but by damn at least we know that we
can't stop looking (28 Oct. 1996)!</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

 I asked, "How will you get anything done as a group if you
never gather together...join together?" He answered,<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A good question.  Follow-up question: what do,
say, Christian groups ever get done?  Not a
whole lot of good, if you ask me (28 Oct.
1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>


Finally, I wrote, "I don't know, maybe I'm 'pink.' But it
seems that this group won't last long if it doesn't plan
regular meetings and establish bonds among members." George
wrote,<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>We've GOT bonds.  We use the Internet to
interact.  So we don't operate like a well-
oiled machine ... I think that's a *good*
thing.<BR><BR>

And no, you're not "Pink" for asking.  But
you're looking at this like it's a normal
religion and finding it doesn't operate that
way.  That's good. That's part of the
deprogramming lesson: to look at things in new
ways.  Now apply that to everything else and
you've got it (28 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

Rev. "Big" Steve A (stands for "Aha!") Confessional Box
Clagscraper Of The Order Of The Small And Petulant Domestic
Rodent responded to my 'commitment' posting on alt.slack as
well. He wrote, <BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>If you "get it", that commitment is there. It
might be a commitment to avoid commitments, but
it's there nonetheless.<BR><BR>

One thing that's nice about the CoSG is that,
unlike other religions, where you're being
carried along on some sort of tide, this one
positively DISCOURAGES you from getting too far
in - your friend is an example: he won't find
people proselytising and trying to explain it
all to him, because if they have to do that,
there's no point.<BR><BR>
Although there are the "Bobbies", who think that
Slack and the CoSG is "cool", but they're not
about to hand over their stash of 'frop or get
nailed to a cross for it, who'll prolly try to
sell you the whole thing. They don't "get it".<BR><BR>

It's like "getting it" is the holy sacrament of
the Church (27 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

In response to my comment, "A faith needs to provide
stability and security among its members, not spread
discord, strife, and confusion," "Big" Steve wrote,<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Does it? Where is that written?</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

"How will you get anything done as a group if you never
gather together...join together?" George wrote,<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>I think I spot a little bit of Protestant Work
Ethic creeping in there. Why do we need to "get
anything done"? Not all religions have to be
about Eternal Salvation, etc. In fact, I happen
to think that all that stuff is basically
nothing to do with religion, but is rolled into
the belief system to control us, like a sort of
promise of a return on services rendered. IMO,
it sucks. And the CoSG gives you 3x your money
back if you don't get eternal salvation (28 Oct.
1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

I wrote, "It seems to me Bob has a message but everyone on
this newsgroup is afraid to ask what it is because 'if you
have to ask, you'll never know.'" Steve responded, <BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>No-one can tell you "Bob"'s message, because it
means nothing in mere words. You have the
message inside your head, and all that the CoSG
can possibly do, with the united aid of Slack
and 'frop, is to open your third ear so you can
hear the message (27 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

I don't know, maybe I'm 'pink.' But it seems that this
group won't last long if it doesn't plan regular meetings
and establish bonds among members.<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>No, you're not necessarily "pink". But you have
obviously bought into the pink conspiracy big-
time, if you're thinking in terms of "doing
things" and planning regular meetings.<BR><BR>

Lemme tell you my take on this. When I was a
kid, I could sing. Not badly, either. This
resulted in my ending up in a church choir, sort
of by default. Even back then, I never bought
into this Christianity schtick much, especially
when I realized that a lot of these so-called
Christian values being rammed down my throat
appeared only to apply to Other People (i.e.,
those not doing the ramming). That, and a
paedophile singing teacher at the church, just
about confirmed it for me, and I bailed out.<BR><BR>

Ever since, I've quietly denied the Christian
faith, even though I know that there is some
core of my being that wants to believe in
something. As I've grown older, and seen and
experienced things happening, piece after piece
of what I always though was "religion" or
"faith" has dropped away.<BR><BR>

The final pieces disintegrated just about when I
hit Usenet, probably because of the illness of
my nearly-Mrs. I had to contemplate mortality as
a very real thing, and had to ask myself a lot
of stuff about who really was "up there". You
could say I became a skeptic, but that's putting
it a bit strongly. What I *did* realise was that
there is nobody "up there"...they're "in here".
That works for me, and the CoSG & "Bob" are nice
hooks to hang that hat on.<BR><BR>

The point is, I don't WANT a religion that tells
me what to do, or makes me pray on Sundays. I'll
"pray" when I damn well want to, and I'll do it
to whichever god is giving out the most coupons
that day. And if the world's going to end soon,
I want to be on the winning side. That's the
side where the preachermen aren't fucking whores
on my donations, paying politicians, forming
lobby groups, or buying automatic weapons under
the table.<BR><BR>

My side.<BR><BR>

But thanks for asking, anyway.<BR><BR>

Oh, and incidentally, I'm a Freemason, which
involved me stating that I believe in a Supreme
Being. I joined before all this change in my
religious outlook, which did make me wonder a
bit. Now, when I'm sitting in a meeting
listening to the various references to 'I'm
Upstairs, I just see it all in terms of "Bob"
and the Cogs, and it all hangs together very
nicely.<BR><BR>

In fact, the Bible works quite nicely like that,
too. Especially the Old Testament (27 Oct.
1996).</FONT SIZE><BR<BR>

An anonymous SubGenius posted:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Oh, lord.  This guy wants COHERENT EXPLANATIONS
OF THE CULT?  OK, since I'm the first one here,
and posting actually seems to be working again,
I'll have to break the bad news to you.  There
ARE no coherent explanations of the cult.  We're
all monkeys with keyboards.</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>
        The Discordians have similar sentiments. The Eris
Society, founded by best-selling financial writer Doug
Casey, originated in Aspen, Colorado in 1981. Their web page
declares,<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>The Eris Society is a unique organization, if it
can be called an organization at all, since it
has no formal structure. It is not incorporated,
it is not a partnership, is owned by no one in
particular. We pay no dues and have no bylaws or
voting. Rather, it belongs to those who are
invited to its annual meeting (Jewet, 16 Nov.
1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

I began a thread of messages called 'commitment' among the
Discordians on alt.discordia and the following materiel is
from the posts that followed. I posed the question, "I don't
get it. If you guys call yourselves a religion, how can you
foster commitment among members if you like chaos so much? A
faith is built upon solidarity and stability, not discord
and strife. If you guys call yourself a religion?" <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>What bearing does what we call ourselves have to
do with the fostering of commitment? Nothing. We
could call ourselves Penguins and it would have
no bearing. We are a religion, but the big
mistake you are making is to try and ascertain
exactly what we are within the narrow minded
confines of your aneristic categorizations.  The
"if you call yourselves a religion has no
bearing. Now "how can you foster commitment if
you like chaos so much..." is a valid question.
The answer is simple. Chaos and order are really
the same thing there is order in chaos and chaos
in order.  Therefore there is chaos in
commitment and commitment in chaos.  One does
NOT preclude the other (Phillips, 21 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

I wrote, "A faith needs to go further than this in order to
survive. There needs to be a place of worship, a set service
time and no tongue-in-cheek irony behind all that you
believe." <BR><BR>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>You are trying to judge the chaos by your
presuppositions i.e.: concepts of order. There
needs to be a place of worship, or a pen to put
the sheep in, only if you need to retain some
control (order) over the sheep.  This is the
aneristic way.  Discordians don't need order.
As for getting together with no tongue in cheek
irony behind what you believe, this is only
valid within the narrow minded aneristic system
as well. It is out firm believe that it is a
mistake to hold firm beliefs. So how in Eris'
name could we get together to formulate out what
we believe is a mistake in the first place?
Which in itself is a firm belief, and so on and
so on till we arrive at the belly button lint of
a Fnord's navel (21 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

Another responded, <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Hey, it's worked for 30 years.  As long as there
is chaos we'll be around (and I don't see the
world running out of chaos anytime soon). Our
place of worship is our pineal gland, you should
visit yours - it's probably a bit dusty.  </FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

 I then asked my question about non-joiners: "The book was
interesting, but it seems that the Discordians won't last
long if they keep telling people 'not to join' or 'don't'
believe anything. Episkopos Galactus I (Keeper of the Sacred
Bacon) answered:<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Nope Erisians have been around for over 3000
years.  For that matter All religions are really
Discordian in nature but just don't realize it.
Even if we vanished tomorrow, there would still

        The Cthulhu cults are less stringently against formal
organization when it comes to forming role-playing game
circles. Because they are often involved in role playing
games, they must provide structure for group activities, or
risk losing members. The following thread between a newbie
and Marc on alt.horror.cthulhu demonstrates the camaraderie
apparent among Cthulhu aficionados:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Newbie:<BR>

I'm just starting out at this.  My friends and I
are new to this game, and I need some help
coming up with ideas for a 1990's campaign.  I
was wondering if someone could sort of hold-my-
hand through the early stages. Any help would be
appreciated.<BR><BR>

Marc: <BR>

I've run CoC off and on for years, but haven't
for a long time. My next campaign has the PCs as
Police Officers in the '90s. One thing I feel is
necessary in a modern campaign is to use the
era, like the majority of the 1920s adventures
seem to.<BR><BR>

Newbie:<BR>

Do scenarios involving the evils of man, not
just those of the Mythos. The evils of post-
modern technology, of rampant immorality, of the
callous inhumanity of the average man. Perhaps
your players are among the few that would even
CARE if the Stars Came Right----what if it
doesn't MATTER if the cults of the Old Ones
remained secret? Do they even need to?<BR><BR>

Marc:<BR>

The forces of the Mythos might use designer
drugs to accomplish their goals, instead of
magicks.<BR><BR>

Perhaps the Tcho-Tcho claimed to be an
"oppressed minority" hostile to the Communist
Chinese---does the US give aid and "advisors" to
Tcho-Tcho "rebels" in northern China and/or
southern former-USSR, and how much does the US
know about them? More then they're willing to
admit, I would guess.<BR><BR>

Just a few ideas for anyone to use...be
creative, update 1920s scenarios if you have to;
IMO, modern Cthulhu is more true to the
originals; Lovecraft wrote about the era he
lived in, not the 19th Century; why should 1990s
Keepers and /or writers be bound to the 20s?</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        However, groups that worship Cthulhu as an entity
follow the same chaotic patterns as the Discordians and the
Church of the SubGenius. The Chaos Cult of Cthulhu 33 is one
group of the Cthulhu irreligion that focuses on Cthulhu as
an actual living entity (or claims to do so in literature).
They write, in the Manifesto,<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Standing between heaven and hearth, and by
divine command, the Crimson Council of Cthulhu
of the CCCXXXIII has decided to appear before
the eyes of humanity as a Cult...The Chaos Cult
of Cthulhu has risen (Tenebrous, 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        The Cambridge University Worshippers of Cthulhu Society
have a web page that details the beliefs of the group and,
with tongue-in-cheek, write,<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Welcome to the home of CUWoCS, the society for
the discerning individual (the individual who
would rather not end as lunch when the Big C
Wakes Up, that is). Here you will find out all
you wanted to know about CUWoCS, lots that you
didn't want to know about CUWoCS, and several
things about CUWoCS that will ensure that you
will provide psychologists with research
material for a long, long time. Enjoy (Damerall,
1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

Like the CUWoCS (and Discordian and SubGenii groups), the
Campus Crusade for Cthulhu organizes around the chaotic. In
this instance, the group organizes so as to "keep his belly
full." The full introductory quote:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Hi welcome to the Campus Crusade for Cthulhu
homepage. This page and soon to be organization
is to be devoted to the God Cthulhu. The great
one needs groups like us to keep his belly full.
The choice then becomes pretty easy ither follow
or become food (Giekes, 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        The newsgroups for these groups also provide a bulletin
board for individuals seeking out information about physical
meetings and times. The following thread is from alt.slack
and concerns an upcoming devival. Eddy Nix posts information
about the happening:<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Temple of the Absurd announces it's March 97
west coast Tour of "Wilhelm Reich in Hell", a
punk rock opera by Robert Anton Wilson....<BR><BR>

We are currently looking for a few more brave
souls to drop their meaningless lives and join
the circus. Our tour will begin in Tempe Arizona
around March 1, and end in Vancouver Mid April. <BR><BR>

We need to set up a few more shows in cities
along the west coast during this time, so if
anyone out there has info, or would like to host
or help us in any way, please respond.<BR><BR>

If you would like to join the circus, and tour
with us, well...respond too (Nix, 26 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

David Lynch responded:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>And I *STILL* don't have a ride to the Devival
next Saturday, dammit. Any help would be
appreciated; it's just a couple miles from
Hilliar, Ohio (Lynch, 26 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>
I got involved and asked David Lynch what went on at a
Subgenius Devival, and he responded,<BR><BR>


<FONT IZE=-1>I got my priorities straight, hell yeah.  My
priorities right now:<BR><BR>

1.  SEX.<BR>
2.  Stimulating spiritual and intellectual
conversation.<BR>
3.  Tape dubbing.<BR>
4.  School work/boring crap.<BR>
5.  Wasting time.<BR><BR>

Sometimes alt.slack crosses from category 2 to
category 5 (Lynch, 27 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

Another SubGenius, His Most Feathered Eminence, The Ur-
Beatle responded,<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>See, that's your problem, Dave, alt.slack needs
to cross over to category 1 (Ur-Beatle, 27, Oct.
1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>


Rev. Pee Kitty, of the order Malkavian-Dobbsian responded to
my question also,<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Sex, lots of it (Pee Kitty, 27 Oct. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

The cults of Cthulhu hold many different conventions, most
of whic surround the gaming world. Groups like CUWoCS and
CCCXXXIII show up, and most participants get involved in the
religiosity of the affairs. The Third Annual Cthulhu Mythos
NecroniCON held in Providence, Rhode Island features a
sermon and prayer for Cthulhu at the Marriott Hotel every
year:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>CTHULHU PRAYER BREAKFAST: Though many expected
Yog-Sothoth to smite us for this blasphemy, the
NecronomiCon membership has now been spared
twice. Once again, the Cthulhu Prayer Breakfast
will offer a loathsome "sermon" by the Rev.
Robert M. Price, as well as other surprises.
Will those attending be spared from Yog-
Sothoth's wrath once again? There's only one way
to find out . . . and, of course, NecronomiCon's
Guest of Honor Brian Lumley and Special Guest
Dirk Mosig will also be in attendance, whether
they want to be or not (Necronomicon Press,
1996).  </FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

The groups, as Stark and Bainbridge point out (1985: 340),
do thrive on the consumer activity of members. The Church of
the SubGenius publishes, along with short stories and
anthologies, two 'gospels:' The Book of the SubGenius and
Revelation X. They also distribute thousands of brochures,
stickers, bumper stickers, and other products. The cults of
Cthulhu see H.P. Lovecraft's and other writers' works
printed every year. There is also a role-playing game
centered on Cthulhu as the nemesis. The Discordians fare
less well, seeing that the Principia Discordia (which is not
copyrighted) has been printed countless times. These
products are not different from the countless Bibles, tapes,
prayer books, rosary beads, statues, candles, rugs, and the
like that are sold by more organized and established
churches. The irreligions, like other religions state that
they are "not about money," but "about ideas."<BR><BR>
        One Cthulhu adoree searches for a statue of Cthulhu on
alt.horror.cthulhu:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>I've seen in a magazine a huge statue of
Cthulhu. Does anyone knows how to find one (and
order it).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

And is answered:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>There's an excellent one just released from
Bowen Designs, created by Stephen Hickman. If
you've seen the paperback of Robert E. Howard's
Mythos stories, Hickman painted the cover art
showing a Cthulhu statue. The sculpted version
is the same one, and it looks terrific. It sells
for $100, and is limited to 1,000 copies.</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

gap. And they see disorder where there is
nothing.<BR><BR>

- Timothy Sutter, on alt.discordia with a
response from alt.slack (21 Aug. 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        Although Stark and Bainbridge write that audience cults
provide no ultimate meaning for members (1985: 28),
neophilic irreligions in fact, do. The authors state that
"Conversations...revealed these people are not the stuff of
which social movements can be made. They accept everything,
more or less, and in effect accept nothing. They are
interested in the general area of the eccentric and the
mystical" (1985: 28). It is true that these traits make the
"attendees at spacecraft conventions" whom Bainbridge
studied open-minded to the degree that it "makes it
impossible for them to develop a strong commitment to any
complete system of thought" (1985: 28). Irreligions,
however, find strength in ultimate meaning systems that
encourage open-mindedness within the belief system they have
constructed. Neophiles accept the new or unfamiliar, but
apply it in ways that comply with deities, beliefs and
tenets of the faiths they belong to. <BR><BR>
        In an alt.discordia newsgroup message, J. Calvin (Bimp)
Smith writes, "Order is not implicitly moral -- or immoral.
Neither is chaos. The above statements are true. The above
statements are false. The above statements are meaningless"
(Smith, 26 Aug. 1996). Discordians are involved in amphorous
beliefs and seem uncommitted to a "complete system of
thought." Yet they are: the complete system of chaos,
embodied in social action, in Eris, and in all forms of
communication. <BR><BR>
        Quoting the Principia Discordia, James Burton posted
another message concerning Eris and her importance in the
chaotic belief structure of the Discordians,<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>This was on the fifth night, and when they slept
that night each had a vivid dream of a splendid
woman whose eyes were as soft as a feather and
as deep as eternity itself...she spoke in a warm
and gentle voice: 'I have come to tell you that
you are free. Many ages ago, My consciousness
left man, that he might develop himself. I
return to find this development approaching
completion, but hindered by fear and by
misunderstanding. You have built yourselves
psychic suits of armor, and clad in them, your
vision is restricted...your spirit broiled by
the sun. I am chaos. I am the substance from
which your artists and scientists build
rhythms...I am alive and I tell you that you are
free (Burton, 23 Aug. 1996 from Malaclypse the
Younger, 1994, 23).</FONT SIZE=-1><BR><BR>

        The ultimate meaning in Discordianism is chaos,
embodied in the form of a woman "whose body was the
spectacular dance of atoms and universes" (1994, 23). Stark
and Bainbridge do not perceive that acceptance of
"everything" can be an ultimate meaning system. The
Discordians have achieved it by wrapping their view of the
universe as chaotic in the robes of Eris and the pages of
humorous literature. Members must be committed to this
meaning system in order to understand and participate in the
irreligion.<BR><BR>
        The Church of the SubGenius establishes a rich
mythology centered on "Bob" Dobbs to disrupt current reality
tunnels and imbue members with the ultimate meaning system
of slack. To the Subgenii, the world is trapped in
perceptions of the world that are outdated and constricting.
The Church promises to "operate on your brain" (Stang, 1996)
to break these narrow reality tunnels. It invites readers,
in many web sites,<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>You seek out the "different," for its own sake,
and that odd trait of yours has led you to
peruse this site. Or has it? What if some
catalyst stronger than your enigmatic
programming, more powerful than the combined
forces of the spirit-world, compelled you to
read (Stang, 1984)?</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        The Church prides itself on an ultimate meaning system
that rests on the idea that "everything is true," and that
the only way out of "the brittle, false, stability of the
artificial structure imposed on society by invisible
authorities" (Stang, 1996) is to accept the mysterious
quality of slack. Slack is the antithesis of the conventions
of modern religious structures. It prods readers to "slack
off," disrupt work environments (or not work at all), and
challenge everything. Slack is a supernatural force embodied
in "Bob" that gives members a meaning system. This system is
centered on the "different" and members are committed to it.<BR><BR>
        The cults of Cthulhu also provide ultimate meaning for
their members: that of an unpredictable universe full of
insanity-wreaking monsters. Agency, which plays a large part
of the other two irreligions, has no role in the cults of
Cthulhu. Members favor the utter fear that will accompany
the annihilation when Cthulhu and his minions rise again
from the waves. So unpredictability and chaos, accompanied
by insanity is the price humans pay for thinking they have
complete control of their environment.<BR><BR>















 <A NAME="general"><FONT COLOR=FF0000><CENTER>GENERAL COMPENSATORS AND THE REWARDS OF CHAOS</FONT COLOR></CENTER><BR>

        Stark and Bainbridge define compensators as "...the
belief that a reward will be obtained in the distant future
or in some other context which cannot be immediately
verified" (1985: 6). Each group possesses general
compensators different form the "diffuse hope" Stark and
Bainbridge offer as the only compensator evident in most
audience cults. <BR><BR>
        Compensators for the three irreligions are grounded in
supernatural assumptions: members exchange the perceived
reward of order in society in return for compensators that
promise everlasting chaos and discord in the social
environment and on earth. This is a strong (not "diffuse")
hope for "a reward of immense value." Each group perceives
the reward in terms of an apocalyptic "end" where social
order and control is either nullified or demolished by
supernatural agents.<BR><BR>
        Discordians willingly exchange ordered lifestyles (by
actively disrupting social norms and conventions) for the
greater compensator of chaos. Members look at chaos as a
reward that will come when the tapestry of social order (as
it is defined by social groups in positions of power) is
rent and disordered creativity pushes individuals and groups
to make choices based entirely on novel triviality. Two
members write in the alt.discordia newsgroup,<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Kerim: I wonder, often, of our existence as
order-making machines.<BR><BR>

Rainer: Most people need this type of pigeon-
holing to get through life, it seems. Such as
shame. I know I often have to work hard to get
away from it.</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        Discordians believe that by 'releasing' order from
their lives, they will unleash chaos and disorder, prompting
new thoughts which can lead to innovation, or, simply,
different thought processes not yet experienced. The
Discordians strive to keep the hodge-podge rotating so that
order (or disorder) does not dominate the social realm. They
do not believe that disorder should dominate, only that
order has been in a position of power for too long. Their
compensator of creative chaos is achieved by sacrificing
'normal ties' to the social environment to which they
belong. <BR><BR>
        The Church of the SubGenius provides a number of
compensators for members. First, the SubGenii established
July 5, 1998 as X Day, or the day that flying saucers from a
Mother Ship will come and whisk away all those who have
joined the Church. Although tongue-in-cheek, the events of X
Day are an important aspect of the Church's activities. They
provide a reason to gather (X Day drills) socially.<BR><BR>
        None of the members of the cults of Cthulhu know when
he will awake from his slumber to spread chaos and horror
across the Earth. But they find power in the knowledge that
it is going to happen. His appearance in the Pacific Ocean
will signal the end of the ordered existence that humanity
has foolishly tried to preserve for so long. Although they
understand that they will be destroyed along with
unsuspecting citizens of human nations, members believe they
will perish with the secret knowledge that Lovecraft wove
into his fiction. This knowledge is far more important to
members than their lives. This compensator is brutal, but
members of the cults of Cthulhu talk of it openly and use
the story as a weapon against the "uninitiated." Those who
don't know about Cthulhu and his imminent return will suffer
a far more insidious death than those who possessed
knowledge beforehand.<BR><BR>



















<A NAME="conflicts"><FONT COLOR=FF0000><CENTER>CONFLICTS WITH SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENTS</FONT COLOR></CENTER><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>Christian morals try to suppress our
natural ways, so I think its a shame that
such an anti-life religion is allowed to
be taught at schools and that we even have
to pay for their heresy!!! The state and
the church should be separated and "god"
should be banished from our schools.
Children are defenseless against xtian
brainwash. We should try to prevent the
further spreading of that unnatural
arabian religion.<BR><BR>

The Christians must be exterminated.  I
support the CHRISTIAN HOLOCAUST for its
cleansing properties.<BR><BR>

-GOAT, on alt.discordia (30 Oct. 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

        One of the defining features of a cult movement is its
antagonistic relationship with the surrounding social
environment. The irreligions are no exception. Antagonism
arrives from within the group, and without. Members tend to
view outsiders as people who 'don't get it.' They tend to
have elitist attitudes that set them apart from "those who
don't know." Conflict is raised from the surrounding
environment who view the irreligions as "joke" religions, or
simple parodies of conventional faiths. Although the
irreligions do ridicule established faiths, they do so in
order to appear different, or uproar to them. These
irreligions have an agenda, and subvert other religions in
order to achieve it. Conflict also is raised from the
surrounding environment who view the members of such groups
as "weird" or "strange." These words have taken on negative
connotations in many social groups, and so set the members
of the irreligions apart from the "norm."<BR><BR>
        The three irreligions have faced little large-scale
conflict with the social environment. This is due mainly to the
fact that the the groups are more an aggregate than a social movment in
Marwell and Oliver's model (1984, 215). Yet there are always at least
two or thre messages floating around the newsgroups that detail the
troubles with the groups' belief systems and how their actions are
subverting social order.<BR><BR>
        For instance, the Church of the SubGenuius was faced with the
following message from Lou Minotti:<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>We have created this folder for the exchange of
information connected to SubGenius Ritual
Abuse...(3 Nov. 1996)</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

To which P-Lil responded:<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>I've been accused of ritually abusing
SubGeniuses before. I've also been accused of
abusing SubGenius rituals--thanks, Dennis! But
most of the abuse I've seen performed by
SubGeniuses were totally unritualized, so what
do we
tell the Feds? "Sorry, we may be sadistic, but
we're hardly organized..."?<BR><BR>

Don't mean to be a wet blanket, but we're not
going to get any additional points on the
Federal Whack-A-Cult meter through cheap ploys
like claiming ritual abuse. Can't we do better
than THAT?</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>

Most conflict, however, comes from close relations with the
members. David Lynch writes about his troubles with a
roommate as well as his problems getting a ride to the next
devival,<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>No, I'm going, that's for damn well sure.  I'll
actually go out and SPEND MONEY to TAKE A BUS
up to Columbus, dammit!  I have to get away
from Paul.. He wants me dead, and makes no
effort to hide it.<BR><BR>

The latest wonderful news is, a week after a
moved out of my cramped little study upstairs
so the computer didn't have to sit out in the
living room, Paul decides he likes my old bed
and starts sleeping there. He doesn't move all
his shit from the basement up there, of course;
he lives it littered with pizza boxes and
potted plants he stole from Subway. Of course,
the computer with the modem is in.. duh.. the
COMPUTER ROOM. And, being the lazy fuck he is,
he usually doesn't get up until around 1 PM.
Being the lazy fuck *I* am, I usually get up at
about 6 AM, to check my email. And I don't
intend to stop doing that because Paul has
started sleeping in the computer room.  This is
not, however, why he hates my guts.  He hates
my guts because I exist.  While you may say
this is not exactly sound reasoning for hating
someone, it's worked for hundreds for
centuries, so why complain?</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>


The groups sometimes use the threads in the newsgroups to
vent hostility against the social environment surrounding
them. They usually accomplish this in a playful, parodic
manner, as James Kenney did on alt.slack (about Lovecraft's
Mythos; a dhole is an enormous worm beneath the surface of
the earth),<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=-1>I was overjoyed when I saw a thread here,
finally, aimed at placing minions of the old
ones in the White House.  But alas, I find that
the cross-posted thread was actually for Bob
Dole.  Sure, you may be thinking, 'Republicans
are Old Ones,' but they can't cut it.  GOP may
be mindless sometimes, and chaotic sometimes,
but the REAL old ones are mindless and chaotic
at the same time.<BR><BR>

So my sole purpose in life is to start the Dhole
for President thread. Enjoy (2 Nov. 1996).</FONT SIZE><BR><BR>
<A NAME="prelude"><FONT COLOR=FF0000><CENTER>PRELUDE</FONT COLOR></CENTER><BR>

        The audience is taking the stage. In many social
environments the audience, once relegated to passivity, now
has a strong voice and autonomy. This is due to a number of
advancements in technology, acceptance of novel forms of
organization, and a irreverence for hierarchies. The
audience has already usurped previous traditional roles. The
audience has taken the stage in Karaoke bars. It acts out
roles during screenings of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show."
And the audience puts on its own shows in parking lots
before the band Phish (and at one time, the Grateful Dead)
go on stage.<BR><BR>
        The Discordians, SubGenii and Cthulhuvians are no
exception. These irreligions were once grouped with other
audience cults under Stark and Bainbridge's model. Now they
thrive as neophiles: active participants in the construction
of the sacred. Much of this dynamic behavior can be linked
to the Internet, and more particularly, the World Wide Web
and interactive newsgroups. These advancements in technology
facilitate ease of communication between audience members,
erasing passivity and encouraging autonomy. <BR><BR>
        The Internet has provided a social space for
Discordians, SubGenii and Cthulhuvians. There, on the
computer interface, thousands of programmers and users alike
can engage in modes of communication and the exchange of
information unheard of ten years ago. Web pages and
newsgroups are the medium for the message. In the case of
these groups, the message is chaos, and this message
reflects the discordant world of cyberspace that members
thrive on day to day.<BR><BR>
        The audience cult has not disappeared, but the
existence of these three groups (and the reasons they exist)
warrants a sibling term. That term is neophilic irreligions:
parodies of traditional religious groups composed of
individuals who hold novelty, discord and unholy equality
among all members in the highest. <BR><BR>
        With this research I have attempted to establish the
Discordians, SubGenii and Cthulhuvians as worthy of study. I
have shown that the Web has allowed these localized groups
to foster growth on a global scale. I have elucidated their
beliefs, and attempted to grasp members' concepts of
commitment, ultimate meaning and conflict with the
surrounding environment.<BR><BR>
        Like any research, this work is a prelude to future
endeavors. These groups have hardly been touched by academic
fields, and sociology is no exception. I offer some
suggestions for further research: a socio-historical
analysis of the groups, a look at the groups through the
lens of deviance theory, further elucidation on "inversion
rituals" (including the mysterious idea of "ha ha only
serious")," more contrasting and comparing of other
interactive audiences, a demographical study (both on and
offline), a cultural study of cyberspace and the
construction of sacred space by the members of these groups,
and finally, more work on the irreligions using social chaos
theory.<BR><BR>
        Each of these ventures will reap new rewards and cast
an investigative light on the esoteric, post-modern and
elusive groups that have been studied here. Whether they
will ever be fully understood is up to the neophiles
involved; following their trail may simply lead to more
chaos...but GOOD chaos.
