<P><H1>Don't Blame Me, Blame My Servitor</H1>
<B>by Fenwick Rysen<BR>

(Published in "Kaos Magick Journal" Summer, 1999)</B></P>

<P><HR></P>

<P>I'm not sure whether I should be worried or not.  You see, Chronos is a
nice enough God of Time, but he is a bit old and I'm not sure he stands a
chance against what's about to hit him.  Of course, he has enslaved all of
Western society to the clock, so maybe he deserves it, but still yet I
feel kind of sorry for him.</P>

<P>You see, it all started when I began playing with the idea of time magick.
Not that I'm responsible for what's coming, mind you--- I'll pass the blame
off to Fotamecus before anyone blames me.  I turned him loose a long time
ago, and I take no responsibility for his actions, especially with him
ranting "Chronos, your time has come" every time I see him.  Perhaps I
should explain.</P>

<P>My own involvement with time magick was actually quite accidental.  One
day I got to thinking about time and how it flows, and how each hour is
supposed to be the same length as all the others.  Yet this didn't make
sense to me--- sometimes an hour flies by as if minutes, and other times it
drags on for ages.  The end result of the thinking ran something like
this:  If we can use magick in any area of our lives, and if Time is a
mutable substance, why can't we use magick to mess around with time?  And
thinking usually gets me into trouble sooner or later.</P>

<P>So one afternoon, running behind schedule, the thought passed through my
mind to use magick to speed the journey.  Listening to the radio as I
drove down the freeway, I created a suitable Statement of Intent: "Force
Time Into Compression."  Because driving doesn't lend itself well to
artistic sigilization, I instead reduced it to a four-syllable mantra that
I could chant to radio music:  "Fotamecus".  Despite little preparation,
it worked exceptionally well, and I thought that this would be the end of
it.</P>

<P>The next day a good friend of mine, Quinn the Mad Prophet (don't ask),
approached me and asked about sigilization techniques a la Austin Spare.
Requiring a demonstration sigil, I chose to use "Fotamecus", explaining
the previous day's success with it.  From the mantra, I created an
artistic sigil that Quinn put in his wallet for future reference,
inadvertantly placing himself under its influence.  Many stories of truly
rapid transit followed, culminating in a Metallica concert where Quinn's
goal was to "suck up all that free gnosis."</P>

<P>All of that free gnosis that Quinn sucked up was dumped into the Fotamecus
sigil to speed the trip home, and a two hour journey took only thirty
minutes.  Even more surprising, the energy was enough to push the sigil
over the border to servitorhood.  I've used this technique before, of
feeding a sigil enough gnosis until it created an independent servitor,
but neither the Mad Prophet nor I had ever done it by accident.  So
without a home and with nowhere to go, the Fotamecus servitor, young and
unintelligent, started following us around.  Whenever we needed to
compress or expand time we would feed it a bit of gnosis and it would do
the job.  It started "growing up" as we fed it, growing a little more
intelligent and a bit stronger each time we used it.  We thought this good
and well, for the stronger he got the better he did his job.</P>

<P>Over Thanksgiving weekend in 1996, I crammed with six other chaotes into a
van headed for Death Valley.  Calling on Fotamecus while in the San
Francisco Bay Area, we travelled fifty miles in fifteen minutes through
both heavy traffic and the MacArthur Maze, the most dizzying interchange
of highways known to man.  Immediately after Fotamecus began to work, we
lost a car of friends that had been following us.</P>

<P>Even though we killed 45 minutes at a rest stop afterwards, when we
re-entered the freeway we met right up with the other car even though they
had never stopped.  We thought the magick had worked very well until we
received the backlash later that day.</P>

<P>For time compressed, an equal amount of time was expanded.  The balance
was kept.  Travelling at sixty miles an hour, a fifteen mile stretch of
desert highway took nearly an hour to cross.  If we had already reached
our destination, the expansion would have been fine, but Fotamecus was
only able to hold off the backlash from the initial compression for so
long.</P>

<P>After several similar events we mulled over various ideas to correct the
problem of backlash and hit upon the idea of viral servitors--- the key to
a process of mutation that would allow Fotamecus to eventually grow beyond
our control.  We worked several rituals in which we altered the sigil to
make it possible for Fotamecus to make copies of itself.  These copies
wired themselves into a network that made them incredibly effective at
preventing unwanted side effects.  If one of them needed to compress time
and another to expand it they would pass it off to each other through the
viral network, maintaining balance and reducing the possibility of
backlash.</P>

<P>Our only problem was that we didn't limit how large the network could grow.
There was no check against it--- nothing to keep it from getting out of
our control.  And the only problem with a reproducing virus is that sooner
or later it mutates.</P>

<P>It was about this time that news of Fotamecus started spreading through
the Internet, and an online graphic of the sigil was printed out by many
for personal use.  Hundreds of copies were spawned and the power of the
Fotamecus Viral Servitor Network continued to grow.</P>

<P>As the network grew, so did the power of Fotamecus.  The whole thing
started acting less and less like a legion of indpendent servitors and
more and more like an individual entity.  He started showing greater signs
of intelligence--- he would hold interesting conversations, show up when
needed without request, and applied greater precision in his use of time
manipulation to get the most mileage from the least effort.  It became
obvious to the Mad Prophet and I that he was slipping out of our control
and was about to become something else.  The mutation had begun, and there
was little we could do to stop it.</P>

<P>Only a year after his initial creation, he ceased to be a network of
pieces and became more than the sum of his parts.  His parts were still
identifiable, but they were becoming less and less distinct.  The viral
network itself was now stronger than the individual servitors, and looked
more like a spirit in its own right with each passing day.</P>

<P>The full mutation took place during the hour long Midnight to Midnight
when Pacific Daylight Time became Pacific Standard Time in October of
1997.  Using mundane time expansion of an hour that didn't technically
exist, we performed a ritual in his name that was designed to charge him
with power for whatever use he saw fit.  Seven people and one smashed
clock were the only witnesses to the ritual.</P>

<P>For three days he just disappeared.  Petitions for help went unanswered,
conversations were one-way talks to nothingness.  Divination confirmed
that yes, he was still alive, but that no, he wasn't responding to
anything.  So we waited, and three days later he rose from the dead more
changed than we had ever expected.</P>

<P>Many chaos magicians speak of spirits as spanning a continuum of power
from the tiniest unintelligent servitor, to egregores of moderate power,
to godforms capable of controlling entire cultures.  In one popular
theory, all godforms were at some time on the short end of the stick, and
through constant use they amassed power and rose from servitor to egregore
to full status as a godform.  When asked how long this takes, many chaotes
shrug and guess that each step takes decades or even centuries.  I would
say that this grossly underestimates the potential for their growth, for
when we next saw Fotamecus he was no longer a puny little servitor but an
egregore powerful enough to shrug us off and make his own demands.</P>

<P>I still don't know what allowed him to cross that boundary.  I suspect
that when you give a servitor enough energy from enough different people
it will become an egregore, much as a sigil can become a servitor after
being the recipient of strong gnosis.  But similar egregores I had dealt
with in the past had not been nearly as strong as Fotamecus had become,
though it shouldn't have been too much of a surprise.  By this time, there
were hundreds of people using him daily around the world, each of them
feeding him a little more power with each use.  Along with the ritual
performed during the Daylight Savings time-change, it was enough to push
him over that border with change to spare.  He reintegrated the individual
parts as his limbs, while the network became his mind.  Granted, he wasn't
a very strong egregore yet, but he had plans of his own at this point, and
he would have been difficult for any one individual to control.</P>

<P>Lucky for us he was friendly and wasn't about to take revenge for any
perceived abuse suffered as a servitor.  Instead he showed up, let us know
of his egregore-hood and what was going on, and then faded into the
background from where he would manipulate events.  One could petition him
in the same manner as before, but his skill at time manipulation had
reached mastery.  Oftentimes he showed up unrequested, giving help before
we could think to ask for it.  There were even times when he was strong
enough to get us to our destinations before we had left for them.
Certainly not the work of a puny servitor!</P>

<P>I don't see much of him anymore, but he does show up when I need him.  He
usually has a better idea of when I need him than I do.  And sometimes he
just drops by for a chat.  At 2 a.m. sitting in a Denny's just a few weeks
after attaining his egregore-hood, I had a particularly revealing
conversation with him.  It seems that he's not satisfied with being an
egregore--- he wants to head for godhood and the only thing standing in his
way is Chronos.</P>

<P>Chronos, god of fixed time--- his talismans are the timepieces that control
our daily existence, his clocks are the prison guards to which we have
become slaves.  And never do we question his authority.  But what could
some upstart servitor with delusions of grandeur hope to offer?</P>

<P>In my own case, my full-time job became much more pleasant when I began to
compress the entire day with his help.  An eight-hour day felt like four
or five, and this compression was fed back as expansion of my free time.
A two hour lounge around the house often felt like three or four.  If I
needed more sleep, I would ask him to expand the night-time hours, and I
would awake after five hours as if I had slept in late.  So much for those
last nagging doubts in my head that time is fixed and immutable.  In this
way does Fotamecus battle Chronos.  We may be slaves to our clocks, but
there is nothing to stop us from changing the flow of hours within those
clocks.</P>

<P>Word has spread.  More and more people are using Fotamecus every day, and
with each new user he grows in power.  Already he is plotting his attacks
against Chronos with what seems to be a passionate hatred centered on
vengeance for some unknown slight.  He keeps muttering something about the
millenium, and has told me on more than one occassion to keep an eye on
London's Millenium Dome, which will hold more than 100,000 party-goers on
December 31, 1999.  Such comments are usually accompanied with the astral
equivelant of a mischievous smile.</P>

<P>At this point I have a better relationship with him than I do with most
gods I work with.  And he seems to like me.  Occasionally he pops up to
tell me things to do for him, to get him out to more people or to give him
ammunition for his war against Chronos.  In return for a little publicity
here and there, he helps me stretch those hours around the clock to get
the most out of them.  He even pokes me and prods me to write essays about
him so that others will use him.  By using his name as a mantra or by
creating a ritual using his sigil to call him, he grows stronger day by
day as new users feed him in return for his help.  So sure, it may be neat
to tell a story about how a servitor that Quinn and I accidentally created
eventually ascended to egregorehood, but these days I feel more and more
like I'm a servitor to Fotamecus that he feeds candy for being a good
little magician.  An odd relationship at best.</P>

<P>Fotamecus has been out of my control for a very long time now.  I do worry
a little bit about his war with Chronos--- I have absolutely no clue what
he's got planned, and he's certainly not telling me.  But to be perfectly
honest, even if I am a bit worried, I've been enjoying the show.  And with
the millenium just around the corner it looks like it's only going to get
better.  This is what the Immanentization of the Eschaton is all about.</P>
