"Elder Gods" is often how most people refer to the collective of powerful
creatures in the Cthulu Mythos.  Things like Cthulu, Azathoth, and
Nyarlothotep.

Yes.  It works, but in my opinion, it's not worth it.  Most of my
experience with it has been very physically taxing, and yielded results
that I could have gotten faster and easier via more conventional means.

It can serve as a wonderful horror factor though.  In casual conversation,
lots of people start to get nervous when you say, "Yeah, I summoned Cthulu
once.  Don't think I'll try it again; the slimy bugger wasn't nearly as
efficient as my home-brewed pantheon."
