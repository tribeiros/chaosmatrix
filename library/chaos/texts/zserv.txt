With all that talk of servetor (how ever they are spelled) and
godforms I was wondering how people here went about their ways of
creating them seeing that most people have diffent ideas and
meathods.

So how about so examples of perfered methods?

Ah, don't worry about the spelling.  I never encountered the word before I
met FireClown.  I think Peter Carroll made it up as part of his attempt to
obfuscate chaos magick.  Demons, imaginary friends, guardian angels, sprites,
elementals, fairies, and practically any other type of entity can be defined
as a servitor if it is bound by you and charged with a special function.
 Servitors can be considered bits of one's psyche that have been given a
certain amount of independence.  For example, FireClown has a bookfinding
servitor that brings him the books he seeks.  FireClown, being a bit
bibliophilic, always has a list of arcane and usually out of print books or
pamphlets he wants, but he is unwilling to spend every free minute wandering
through SF's billion used bookstores.  So he lets his servitor do it for him,
and the books appear.  Often a friend will say, weren't you looking for this
particular book?  etc...  FireClown will tell you, if you wish, how he
created this servitor.  William Blake had servitors that taught him painting
and also, by the looks of one of his illustrations, swept his floors.  How
good of a job his domestic servant servitor did is not recorded, to my
knowledge, but the one that taught him painting was certainly very talented
and did a fine job.

I, and, I believe, FireClown, have a group of servitors who cluster around
us.  I can sense them, but I do not know their names.  I send them out to do
my bidding, and occassionally call them back.  These entities appear to be
both loyal and vicious. I usually charge them with jobs in Baphomet
ceremonies. Because I do not find Baphomet, sweet and hairy though he is, a
particularly wankable entity,I  do blood ceremonies.  Because I'm fairly
squeamish about bloodletting, I use a retrctable lancet thingie with sterile
needles to draw blood.  I then smear the blood either on a crystal I have or
on the image of the god himself.  I then order my servitors to perform their
deed and ask the God to keep and eye on them.  Sometimes, if I am harmed by
another person, the servitors appear to assume that I wish them to create
harm in return and I have had occassion where I have had to tell them not to
attack an attacker.  Sometimes I don't care.  The last person who stole
jewelry from me ( a lot, five years ago), was shot dead in a bar shortly
after the theft.  In this case I did not tell my demons to attack, but they
may have anyway.  I do not know.  It is sometimes helpful for me to think
that they did.  Because I am a black magician (interested in those areas of
my psyche that are hidden from me and frighten me), my servitors are demons.
But for many chaotes I think they are not.

I think that servitor development has something to do with childhood.  I
believe most of us developed servitors in childhood and that some of these
might still be hanging around in our psyches.  At least the means to develop
an imaginary entity that has a certain autonomy seems to be wired into the
imaginative faculties of most children.  Movies on this subject include Drop
Dead Fred, Toy Story, Tetsudo, and Natural Born Killers.  Books on this
subject are endless and include grimoires, children's stories, and any number
of fantasy mythologies.

Phil Hine deals with this topic at length, best in his pamphlet Condensed
Chaos,less well in his book Condensed Chaos.

I don't personally do much sigil magick.  Mostly I work with unnamed
servitors, lucid dreaming, and godforms.  Lucid dreaming, BTW, is a fine way
to develop control over psychic entities, since in lucid dreaming it is
relatively easy to modify characteristics of the dream environment, including
the entities that populate the dream.

A pleasure to answer your question, Jim.  I would like to hear from others
since I will, within a couple of months, be writing the second part of my
bloody long essay on Sigils, Servitors, and Godforms.

In chaos,

marik

To me, the best descriptive name applied to what Carroll and many Chaotes
call a servitor is "bud-will", although I also frequently call them
"fetches" as well.  I see them as a disembodied attribute of desire; in
other words, servitors are manufactured entities with a singular purpose
to their existence.  One could also think of a servitor as the ghost of
an obsession that has been exorcized from it's home and can return to it
only when it has united itself with the object of it's desire.

Once created, I think servitors have a limited degree of free will -
limited by the scope of the desire they have been created to achieve.  I
don't think they can cognize or perform actions not related to fulfilling
their initial objective.  They are a ball of higher-energy seeking to
return to a state of lower energy by dissipating the force that binds
them into externality by uniting with an object (as E.E. Rehmus wrote,
"an arrow never forgets its target").  For me, the defining criterion
that makes something a servitor is that it is always under the control of
its creator, in that its very existence is bound inextricably to it's
creator's desire.

The next step up, if you will, from servitor is egregor.  An egregor can
be thought of as a servitor whose "being" is made up of the disembodied
desires of a number of individuals working in cooperation, so that no ONE
person creates/controls it.  Egregors are multi-purpose and often (though
not always) have a more long-term existence, as they have been created
for several purposes.  This is true even when all who participate in its
creation have used the same statement of intent and expressed the same
desire, because even though every statement of intent may be semantically
identical, the way in which this formulated desire would be fulfilled
will differ from person to person.  Thus, while an egregor's several
purposes will usually be related, it is not nearly so homogenous as a
servitor/fetch/bud-will.

Finally, there are godforms.  A god or godform is by far the most
difficult to create, as it is (as far as I've been able to tell so far!)
impossible for a single person to create.  Godforms may have any number
of purposes, and (unlike the two forms above) are dependant not upon a
single act of creation, but instead upon a series of ongoing and
unconnected acts of creation which take the form of a series of seedings
with desires.  As an example, I'll cite the Judeo-Christian Jehovah.
Jehovah probably began life as an egregor created by a Semitic tribe of
somewhat nomadic status that took its god with it during its wanderings.
In the course of contact with other cultures, other tribes began to ask
Jehovah to fulfill its desires - protect us from natural disasters, bring
us justice, smite our enemies, what have you.  After awhile, the egregor
evolved a certain apparent independence of action, to the point where it
was credited with its own acts of creation, due to the fact that it
became composed of a complex of desires large enough that no one person
or group knew of all the desires that served as its formative energy (cf
statement of intent again).  The relationship between the desire and
attributes given to the godform by its "worshipers" eventually became so
complex that its motives could no longer be understood by any one person
who participated in its ongoing creation, and in fact its creators
weren't even aware of each others motives in seeking access to the
egregor anymore.  A godform is no longer under the control of its
creator, and direct knowledge of all things involved with the egregor are
no longer known to any single person or group.  Depending on the weight
of the desire "fed" to the godform, it may even end up turning on its
original creators eventually.  Thus, it begins (in the eyes at least of
any given observer) to take on attributes and perform actions of its own
will.  It begins to be described in mind and speech in more-or-less
anthropomorphicized terms - it may appear to be wrathful, or just, or
even insane, the last if its seed-desires become very conflicted in
intent and gravity.  Godforms may even have important lessons to teach,
if only because the relations engendered in it between desires, and the
fact that it will continue to hang around after unification with the
object of any given desire is achieved, end up creating new information
that accrete to the godform itself.

There are as many ways of creating servitors as there are ways of
performing any given magickal act.  My own personal favorite way of
creating a servitor is to "mythologize" a sigil.  That is, I'll create a
material basis sigil and then muck about with its appearance until I have
created a sort of chimaera.  A good example of this is a thing called a
"Watcher" that I've used in the past (and to great benefit!).  The
technqiues I used for this are embedded in the following working:

                              +++++++++++

WATCHER CONJURATION

It is the intention of this working to create a particular type of
servitor called a Watcher.  The Watcher's function, as its name implies,
is to act as guardian for its creator, functioning in effect as an extra
pair of eyes.  It may be bound to a particular place as a watchman, or
may be of a more spatially general nature, per the specifications of the
conjurer.

Materials Needed

Octarine-colored lights  &  Ouranian Incense  &  Material from which to
create a figurine (i.e., clay, wax, wood)  &  Glass container  &  A
square of silk  &  Wrapping large enough to cover the glass container
&  Black electrical tape  &  A cigarette of any type

Preliminaries

1.  Fashion a figurine in the form of a horned serpent, and paint it (if
    desired) in whatever colors you desire, with the exception that the
    figurine's eyes should be in a color that forms a "flashing color" in
    combination with octarine.  Pay very close attention to detail, and use
    utmost skill in your creation of the figurine.

2.  Decide upon a name for the Watcher; there are no rules for this choice.

3.  Draw upon the wrapping for the container your personal sigil/glyph.
    This will face into the container.

4.  Inscribe upon the cigarette the planetary sigils for Ouranos (at the
    end that gets lit), Jupiter (in the center), and Mars (at the end of
    the smokeable part).

5.  Make sure that your working area is lit only with the octarine
    lights, and fumigate well with the Ouranian incense.

The Conjuration

0.  Open a Vortex, ending it with the words "XIQUAL (name of the Watcher)"

1.  Place the figurine upon your altar.

2.  Recite the following invocation to Ouranos:

Io Ouranos!  Serpent of Octarine Flames!
I summon thee from within me, within me!
Io Ouranos (repeat 8 times)
The Octarine arrow pierces my creation
(Visualize an octarine eight-rayed star within the figurine)
The name of this servitor, this Watcher, is (Watcher's name)
Come, Ouranos, breathe life into my creature!
Ouranos, God of Magick Octarine
Ouranos, Serpent Octarine
Ouranos, Baphomet, Semyaza, Carmara (repeat 7 times)

Repeat the above 3 times, maintaining strictest concentration upon the
figurine throughout.

3.  Still focusing exclusively upon the figurine, address it with the words:

Watcher!  (say its name)
I am thy god, you are my servant
Serve me well, watch for me and warn me,
I shall reward you with life;
Fail me, and I shall destroy you forever!

4.  Light the cigarette and inhale some of the smoke.  As you exhale it
    over the figurine, chant the words "Io Ouranos" with the first drag,
    "Io (your magical name here)" with the second, and "Io (insert
    Watcher's name here)" with the third.  The intonation of each phrase
    should last exactly as long as does your exhalation of smoke.

5.  Repeat step 4 until the cigarette has been entirely consumed.  It is
    best to smoke the entire cigarette without losing any of the ashes.

6.  The cigarette being finished, rub the entire interior of the glass
    container briskly with the square of silk.

7.  Pick up the figurine and place it upon whatever item you are
    accustomed to using as a focal point on your altar.  Address the
    Watcher with the words:

(Watcher's name), here is Axis Mundi!
This is my body
This is your soul!
Serve me well, watch for me and warn me,
and I shall reward you with life;
Fail me, and I shall destroy you forever!
You are my servant; I am thy god!

8.  Hold the Watcher in the incense smoke and say to it:

(Watcher's name), here is Spiritus Mundi!
This is the breath of Ouranos
This is my breath!
Serve me well, watch for me and warn me,
and I shall reward you with life;
Fail me, and I shall destroy you forever!
You are my servant; I am thy god!

9.  Place the Watcher against your own body until its temperature is the
    same as your own, while addressing it with the words:

(Watcher's name), here is Stella Sol!
Here is warmth and succor
Here is fire and brimstone!
Serve me well, watch for me, protect me
and I shall reward you with life;
Fail me, and I shall destroy you forever!
You are my servant; I am thy god!

10.  Place the figurine inside the glass container and seal it.  Wrap
     the container in whatever wrapping you have chosen, with your personal
     sigil facing inward.

11.  Fasten the wrapping shut with the electrical tape in the form of an
     eight-rayed star.

12.  Shout out, "It's alive!  Alive!"

13.  Close the Vortex and anokquz.

Notes

Once you have wrapped the glass container, it is not to be opened
again.  No one but the conjurer should ever see the Watcher-figurine,
and no light should ever fall on it save octarine light.  Should the
container ever get broken, prepare a new container and transfer the
figurine to it only after having fumigating with Ouranian incense and
illuminating the working space solely with octarine light.

Ideally, no one but the conjurer should be told precisely what the
container holds.
                         ++++++++++++++

Should a working similar to the above be performed by a group instead of
by one individual, I would consider the result to be an egregor.  Should
the resultant egregor become adopted and used by other groups not
connected directly to the original group, I would consider it to have
become a godform.

There are of course gray areas in this whole process that beg greater
exploration (ain't it always the way? :), and like all definitions the
ones I use are over-simplifications, but I hope I've gotten the ideas out
clearly enough to be useful and not engender misunderstanding.

        Here's a shot at explaining my angle.

        Servitors are attracted, found, or created by any of a very wide
        array of methods and pathways.

        Not all ways are intentional, and many are of very dubious authorship,
        I.E., I'm not always sure where they come from. I qualify them as
        Servitors if they SEEK to please me, even if they don't ACTUALLY do
        so.

        I create them in a variety of ways, here are some-

        I collect Items in a bag, box, or jar (vessel from here on out), which
        said items relate to a specific focus of work. For a bookfinder, the
        vessel will at first contain a sigil built from the word <bookfinder>.
        Here is the first distinction that I am building a Servitor, not
        making a Sigil, as a Sigil would perhaps state <I desire the Book of
        Results>, while a Servitor is a job description. I then place more
        things relating to the Job in the vessel, perhaps some blood or
        semen, perhaps some shavings from the pages of a hard to find book.
        I'll periodically address the vessel, asking it to find me books
        and lead me to them when it has found them. If I find the Book Of
        Results, if I bought it I'll put the reciept in the vessel, or if
        I find that I can xerox a copy, I copy a page of the book to place
        in the vessel. I say, Thanks, Bookfinder, how about the Theatre of
        Magick? and so on...

        Now the above actions could be said to be creation, but the above
        instance seems like attraction, like I noted what I wanted and
        something, I have no clue what, came to fill the position. Maybe
        an out-of-work ghost who likes bookstores and the Attention and
        Candy I give it.

        Sometimes I quite definately have made something. I'll carve a body
        from wood, and carve sigils and bindrunes on it, and, again, feed
        it blood and semen. I'll make up a name for it, Fritz, perhaps,
        and inculde it in my ritual work. These I tend to sleep with, and
        I breathe on them alot, too. Usually I they 'wake up' in dreams, and
        if it is a squid-form I'll dream of squid-things. Again, once it gets
        going I just talk to and tell it what I need it to do, and if possible
        carry it around in my pocket while I do my thing... I find it good
        to sneak it out and show it the world, but I'm funny that way.....

        I find things when I do an exorcism of a person or place, and I like
        the energy flux I find...I tell the critter it can come home with
        me, and join in the fun we call My Life...often they come along
        without hesitation, and sort of disapear in coming months, just
        poping up sometimes, 'DON'T WALK DOWN THIS STREET'. In New Orleans
        this happened, but I had to keep going where I was going, it was
        very much like a voice in my head, saying 'BIG NASTY SHIT!!!!', to
        which I said, 'I need to get to my bike & get home, keep me posted'.
        I got within 100 yards of my horse and it says 'SOON SOON SOON' so
        I slip my knife out & open it, keeping it well hidden against my body.
        I'm on Decatur St and all the sudden it is like everybody vanishes,
        except for two drunk frat boys, and voice goes 'THEM THEM THEM'-
        as the begin to walk past me, the closest grabs me & I let him spin
        me past his fist and open his clothes and at least a bit of him
        with the knife as I spin on past...They both bolted and ran, and
        my Voice and I went and had dinner...

        I think the basic form of Servitor is what I call a Protect-Me-You!
        Whose job is to keep you aware of danger and assist in trouble. I
        learned of these from an old Romanian woman who spoted another part
        East-European Gypsy thief at work, namely me. She told me you put
        stolen goods, broken locks, skeleton keys, nails, razorblades, etc
        in a vessel along with some of your hair and blood, and something
        from your dead ancestors, seal it up, and bury it, and for God's
        sake be more careful! A Witches bottle for thieves. I still find
        myself saying- Protect me, You! When doing Questionable things.

        I have also found that if I make alot of Sigils for related desires,
        they group together and form work-parties- becoming a Servitor.

        I must add that I have no Idea how magick works, and try to play
        as much as possible...my Servitors reflect this. Circus Bears and
        Astral Doubles of my bicycle (A Sorcerous Horse), and alot of
        shadows and dreams. I very specificaly avoid being hard-line about
        anything, and run solidly on a mixture of Desire, Intuition, and Luck.
        Of course I have Servitors for these three things who get paid
        overtime in Candles, Candies, and Incense....

        Hoping this be helpfull
