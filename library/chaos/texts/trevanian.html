I found this particularly thought provoking as a guy working at the
McDonald's of the Occult.

"Your scorn for mediocrity blinds you to its vast primitive power. You
stand in the glare of your own brilliance, unable to see into the dim
corners of the room, to dilate your eyes and see the potential dangers of
the mass, the wad of humanity. Even as I tell you this, dear student, you
cannot quite believe that lesser men, in whatever numbers, can really
defeat you. But we are in the age of the mediocre man. He is dull,
colorless, boring -- but inevitably victorious. The amoeba outlives the
tiger because it divides and continues in its immortal monotony. The masses
are the final tyrants. See how, in the arts, Kabuki wanes and withers
while popular novels of violence and mindless action swamp the mind of the
mass reader. And even in that timid genre, no author dares to produce a
genuinely superior man as his hero, for in his rage of shame the mass man
will send his yojimbo, the critic, to defend him. The roar of the plodders
is inarticulate, but deafening. They have no brain, but they have a
thousand arms to grasp and clutch at you, drag you down."  -- Trevanian
