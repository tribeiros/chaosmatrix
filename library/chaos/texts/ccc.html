<H1>Liber CCC<BR>
Chaos, Carroll and Crowley</H1>
<H2>by Fran Nowve</H2>

<P><HR><P>

<P>As a Thelemite and a member of OTO, I was first
attracted to Chaos Magick by the many surface signs of similarity
I saw between the two &quot;systems.&quot; Certain catch phrases
used by Chaotes, such as &quot;lust of result&quot; and
&quot;greater Feats,&quot; are right out of the Book of the Law.
Both Carroll and Crowley named many of their books &quot;Liber
This or Liber That,&quot; for example. And in the OTO Gnostic
Mass, the Credo names &quot;Chaos&quot; as &quot;one secret and
ineffable LORD...of whose fire we are created, and to which we
shall return...&quot; The Credo goes on to name
&quot;Babalon,&quot; the &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;Womb.&quot;
Temple Babel,&quot; whose poster in Curios and Candles
proclaimed, &quot;Do what thou wilt is our law,&quot; turned out
to be a temple of Chaos Magick. The third name of the Credo,
&quot;Baphomet,&quot; also has an honored place in Carroll's
writing.</P>

<P>Upon further study, I found deeper similarities
and, of course, differences as well. Like Crowley, Carroll wanted
to demystify magick and make it the subject of scientific
scrutiny. Defining magick as &quot;the Science and Art of causing
Change to occur in <a name="1">conformity with Will.&quot;<a
href="cccfn.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> Crowley further postulated,</a></P>

<blockquote>
    <a name="2"><p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;ANY required Change may
    be effected by the application of the proper kind of degree
    of Force in the proper manner through the proper medium to
    the proper object.&quot;</font><a href="cccfn.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></a>
</blockquote>

<P><font size="3">If you do it right, it will work.
Carroll continued Crowley's work, applying magical principles to
the science of our times, Quantum Physics.</font></P>

<P><font size="3">Crowley was always working at
further understanding his consciousness and discovering the roots
of knowledge as well as the parameters of what is unknown. He
fostered a healthy skepticism as, for example, in his work on
developing a magical memory. One such method involves learning to
think backwards and to use this ability to &quot;remember&quot;
before one's birth to previous incarnations. But he constantly
cautioned the magician to check his findings against known
&quot;objective&quot; details and even so,</font></P>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;The Master Therion does
    not care a scrap of yesterday's newspaper whether he was
    Marius de Aquila, or whether there ever was such a persion,
    or whether the Unierse itself is anything more than a
    nightmare created by his own imprudence in the matter </font><a
    name="3"><font size="2">of rum and water.&quot;</font><a
    href="cccfn.html#3"><font size="2"><sup>3</sup></font></a></a></p>
</blockquote>

<P><font size="3">Crowley prescribed a rigorous
regime of yoga (<em>Book IV</em>) to still the mind and body,
enabling one to concentrate and focus energy. He created A<img
src="therefore.gif" width="10" height="10">A<img
src="therefore.gif" width="10" height="10"> to further these
goals. Carroll called his order, IOT, &quot;the magical heirs
to...A<img src="therefore.gif" width="10" height="10">A<img
src="therefore.gif" width="10" height="10">&quot; and prescribed
the same courses of discipline (<em>Liber MMM</em></font>) to
develop the magical self.</P>

<P>Both had a penchant for analyzing history in
terms of successive aeons. Crowley divided history into the Aeons
of Isis, Osiris and Horus, representing Matriarchy, Patriarchy
and the present time of equality between the sexes (the
&quot;Crowned and Conquering Child&quot;). Carroll developed a
more detailed analysis of history. He named four Aeons: Shamanic,
Religious, Rationalist and Pandemon. Each of these is divided
into two &quot;sub-aeons,&quot; Animist/Spiritist,
Pagan/Monotheist, Atheistic/Nihilist and
<a name="4">Chaoist/?.<sup><a href="cccfn.html#4">4</a></sup> Elsewhere,
he divides history into
dive Aeons, Shamanism, Paganism, Monotheism, Atheism</a> and
Chaoism (a return to the first <a name="5">aeon but in a higher
form).</a><a href="cccfn.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a></P>

<P>While Carroll doesn't put as much emphasis on
Qabalah and alchemy as Crowley, and downright debunks Astrology,
he devised a syst<a name="6">em in <em>Liber NOX</em><sup><a href="cccfn.html#6">6</a></sup>
which has elements of all three. Mercury, Sulfur and Salt/Earth,
elchemical principl</a>es, could be seen to correspond to the
Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable signs in Astrology.<sup><a href="cccfn.html#7"> 7</a></sup>These alchemical
principles are juxtaposed against a system of duality, Coagula
and Solve, also alchemical principles (or coherence and
dissolution) which also appear on Levi's Baphomet. He lists five
pairs of opposite emotions and charts them with the three
alchemical principles to create a complex system of glyphs which
he suggests can be equated to &quot;Trum<a name="8">ps of the
Tarot.&quot;<sup><a href="cccfn.html#8">8</a></sup> Then he puts them on a traditional
Qabalistic Tree of Life which correspondences t</a>hat are quite
correct in terms of the <a name="9">orthodox tradition.<sup><a href="cccfn.html#9">9</a></sup>
His system of color magic also corresponds to the traditional
Qabalah. It is interesting how well rooted Carroll is in magical
tradition, original though he is.</a></P>

<P>Of all the areas in which Carroll and Crowley can
be compared, the most interesting is in the concept of True Will
and the Great Work (the &quot;knowledge and conversation&quot; of
one's &quot;Holy Guardian Angel&quot;)<a name="10">. In some
places, Carroll speaks of these things in much the same terms
Crowley did. In <em>Liber LUX</em>, Augoeides,<sup><a href="cccfn.html#10">10</a></sup> he
write</a>s,</P>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;The magician's most
    important invocation is that of this Genius, Dæmon, True
    Will, or Augoeides. This operation is traditionally known as
    attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian
    Angel...or Great Work,&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<P><font size="3">and &quot;A person doing his true
will is assisted by the momentum of the universe...&quot; He goes
on to describe what Crowley called the Oath of the Abyss,</font></P>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;He takes complete
    responsibility for his present incarnation and must consider
    every experience, thing or piece of information which assails
    him from any source, as a reflection of the way he is
    conducting his existence.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<P>Crowley wrote, &quot;the Oath of the Master of
Temple is 'I swear to interpret every phenomenon as a particular
dealing of God with my <a name="11">soul.'&quot;<sup><a href=cccfn.html#11">11</a></sup> Also,
in Psychonaut, the Demon Chronzon, Carroll bids the magician to
&quot;invoke the real HGA or K</a>ia. Firstly the ego can be put
in its place by deliberately seeking union with anything one has
rejec<a name="12">ted.&quot;<sup><a href="cccfn.html#12">12</a></sup>
Cro</a>wley:</P>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;such a practice will
    consist in training the mind and the body to confront things
    which cause fear, pain, disgust, shame and the like. He must
    learn to endure them, then to analyze the</font><a name="13"><font
    size="2">m until they give pleasure and instruction, and
    finally to appreciate them for their own sake.&quot;<sup><a href="cccfn.html#13">13</a></sup></font></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="3">O</font><a name="14"><font
size="3">n the other hand, Carroll also speaks, in other places,
as if True Will doesn't exist. In <em>Liber KKK</em>,<sup><a href=cccfn.html#14">14</a></sup>
Conjuration 15,</font></a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;If a true will is
    presumed to exist, then the conjuration must be directed
    toward its discovery and implementation. I...have observed
    the process go spectacularly wrong in numerous cases.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><a name="15"><font size="3">And in the Demon
Chronzon,<sup><a href="cccfn.html#15">15</a></sup></font></a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Most mystics...claim
    that their ego has been obliterated and merged into union
    with the godhead.... They have merely employed some form of
    gnostic exaltation to inflate their own ego into an immense
    version of god that they have been carefully cultivating. The
    process differs not one whit from that employed by the black
    magician who also inflates his ego to cosmic dimensions...the
    same thing happens when a magician attempts to invoke his
    Holy Guaradian Angel.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="3">And</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2"></font><a name="16"><font
    size="2">"A curious error has entered into many systems of
    occult thought. This is the notion of some higher self or
    true will which has been misappropriated from the
    monotheistic religions."<sup><a href=cccfn.html#16">16</a></sup>
</font></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Finally,</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;There is no sovereign
    sanctuary wi</font><a name="17"><font size="2">thin ourselves
    which represents our real nature.&quot;</font></a><font
    size="2"><sup><a href="cccfn.html#17">17</a></sup></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Professor Sidney Hook used to tell
our philosophy class, &quot;I don't want any of you to agree with
anything I say unless you just can't help yourselves.&quot;
Sometimes Peter Carroll seems to be saying the same thing </font><font size="3">to his readers. He contradicts himself
(or appears to) as a statement against the notion of
&quot;absolute truth.&quot; H</font></a><font
size="3">e slides into different paradigms as he finds each
useful in its turn. To emerse oneself in such a
mindset(s) is to</font><a name="18"><font size="3"> truly
&quot;cross the abyss&quot; and enter a realm where everything is
both true and untrue simultaneously. Or, as Carroll expressed it,
&quot;Chaoist magic is characterized by it's cavalier attitude to
meta</font></a><font size="3">physics...&quot;<sup><a href="cccfn.html#18">18</a></sup></font></p>
