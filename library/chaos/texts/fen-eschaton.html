There tends to be some confusion over the word "immanentization".  You see,
most people assume it's the word "imminent" which means forthcoming or
approaching.  But the word is <I>imm<B>A</B>nent</I>, which means all-pervasive, being
everywhere all at once.<BR><BR>

The "eschaton" is typically taken to be "the end of the world as we know
it", and this can be interpreted many ways.  By the reasoning of most
chaotes, the "immanentization of the eschaton" means that the eschaton is
happening constantly; the world as we knew it dies and is reborn in every
moment; things are constantly changing.<BR><BR>

See, there goes another eschaton.  Opps, there goes another.  Hey, look at
that one go!  Wait, I see another one coming!<BR><BR>

To immanentize the eschaton means (for me at least) to be aware of and part
of the process of change in my environment.  It means trying to immanentize
the eschatons of the people around me, destroying the consensual belief
structure and bringing on the end times.<BR><BR>

The eschaton already happened.<BR>
The eschaton is approaching.<BR>
The eschaton is the moment right now.<BR>

Do we speak of the supposed "Fifth Aeon" when we discuss the 'eschaton?'
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Fifth Aeon?  Hail Eris!<BR><BR>

Did I miss the previous four?  Who labelled them?  What gave them the
right?<BR><BR>

There are no Aeons; the only constant is change.  Human evolution
(biological, cultural, spiritual, etc.) is too interesting, varied, and
strange to try to categorize into four (or any nhumber) of "Aeons".  This
Aeonic crap is bullshit made up by people who like to feel they are on the
verge of something great----invaribaly, Aeonists always say that we are on
the border of two Aeons, moving from the old into the new.  Their proof is
the radical changes taking place in the world.  But here's the real kicker:
The world is always undergoing radical change.  Duh.<BR><BR>

Did the 'eschaton' come and go, leaving me in the closet, or what?  :-)
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

No; Yes; Maybe.<BR><BR>

Try looking <I>in</I> your closet for the eschaton.  I'm sure you'll find one
there.<BR><BR>
