For your geeky pleasure, the following is a perl program which gives
today's date in the traditional Discordian format.  It also notifies
you of holy days and other such nonsense.  There are no bugs in it, so
don't report any to me.  It works just fine the way it is.<BR><BR>

To run it, store it in a file named something creative like
"ddate.perl" and then enter the command "perl ddate.perl".  Happy
dating.<BR><BR>

                         All hail Discordia,<BR>

# ddate - Discordian date
# Version FIVE

# This program takes no arguments.  It doesn't take shit from _anyone_.
#
# It returns today's date in the Discordian calendar format.  It also
# tells you if today is a Holyday.
