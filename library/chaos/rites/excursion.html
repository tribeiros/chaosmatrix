<H1>Chaos Excursion</H1>
<H3>An exercise of the Disk<BR>
Supplement to the Jihad and Monasticism</H3>

<HR>

One may choose to perform an Excursion of Chaos for any amount of  time
they see fit, though at least one week is suggested.  During their
Excursion, the individual will consider themselves as on a journey of
Chaos and will call themselves a "Pilgrim of Chaos".  The individual may
choose to follow the Lesser, Greater, or Extreme Excursion at their
discretion.  The Excursion is a personal journey and should not be spoken
of at length until after the Excursion has been completed.  The purposes
of the Chaos Excursion are as follows:<P>

<OL>
<LI>    To embark upon a journey of/for Chaos.
<LI>    To strengthen the powers of silence.
<LI>    As an exercise in Religious Humility, and idea which
        should be Laughed at in some length after the
        Excursion has been completed.
<LI>    To exercise the powers of fanatic belief.
<LI>    To create the birth of Chaos, bringing it to action.
</OL>
<P>

<HR>

<B>THE LESSER EXCURSION:</B>

<OL>
<LI>    Carry a magical Pentacle with you at all times.
<LI>    Dedicate any sexual act to the birth of Chaos.
<LI>    Perform the Excursion Rite once every day.
<LI>    Dedicate ten minutes of each day to a silent vigil
        performed in a humble posture.
</OL>
<P>

<B>THE GREATER EXCURSION:</B>

<OL>
<LI>    Perform each step of the Lesser Excursion.
<LI>    Journey by foot to a chosen area of privacy once per
        day.
<LI>    In this area of privacy, dedicate 10 minutes to
        silence in a humble posture.
<LI>    After silence is completed, recite a prayer to Chaos
        in this place of privacy.
<LI>    Relate to Chaos each thing you see on your journey
        to this place of privacy.
</OL>
<P>

<B>THE EXTREME EXCURSION:</B>

<OL>
<LI>    Perform each step of the Greater Excursion (which
        includes the Lesser).
<LI>    Interrupt the sleep midway through to perform a
        second Excursion Rite.
<LI>    Complete steps 2 through 5 of the Greater Excursion
        a second time each day, devoting 15 minutes to
        silence on each trip instead of 10.
</OL>
<P>

The place of privacy the Pilgrim conducting the Greater or Extreme acts of
Excursion will journey to should be at least one block away and outside if
possible.  The prayer to Chaos can be a personal prayer written by the
individual and can be differe nt for each recital, or one may use the
example below.  A humble posture is any posture in which the Pilgrim feels
they are supplicating themselves before Chaos.  In devoting any sexual act
to giving birth to Chaos, one is actualizing the action elem ent of Chaos,
bringing it forth into the world.  After the Excursion is complete, the
Pentacle should be kept as a magical tool and can be inscribed with a
record of the Excursion as is done in the Eucharistia of Chaos.  If the
Excursion is unsuccessful, the Pentacle should be destroyed.<P>

Example of a Prayer to Chaos
</H3>

Oh Chaos,<BR>
That Void from which All springs,<BR>
I humble myself before Thy Terrible Magnificence.<BR>
Oh Great Chaos,<BR>
You prove that Nothing is True<BR>
and Everything is Permitted.<BR>
Oh Great Reigning Mother and Father of All,<BR>
I commit myself as thy humble servant.<BR>
Oh Great Formless<BR>
From which All finds Its beginning,<BR>
You exist and the Earth Smiles.<P>

<HR>
<H3>
The Pilgrim Rite
</H3>
The magician will have an altar which will be just above his/her reach
when kneeling (a table will suffice).  On this altar, which should be
covered by a dark earthy coloured cloth, the magician will place the
magical Disk. Dark green candles should be burnt during this rite, and
earthy incense (perhaps Valerian and Cedar) may be used as well.  The
magician should be robed in brown if possible.<P>

The rite commences with a short prayer:<P>

I do nothing but myself.<BR>
I do truth,<BR>
For nothing does truth<BR>
And I do nothing<BR>
But myself.<BR>
Nothing is True,<BR>
Everything is Permitted,<BR>
Something is Material.<P>

<OL>
<LI>The magician will kneel, half sitting, on his/her knees before the
altar.  The magician shall be holding his/her arms forward, bent at the
elbows, palms up in an offering gesture.

<LI>Bow the head as if pleading with some unknown deity to take an
offering.  The magician states: "When I give, I give to myself".

<LI>The magician stands, takes the Disk from the altar. "When I take, I
take of myself".

<LI>Hold the Disk close to the breast, cherishing it. "The universe is at
my hands, clothed in earth."

<LI>Holding the Disk, stretch out the hands roughly, pushing against the
action and state: "GRIBCAV!" - The Birth of Chaos.  Then, putting the disk
on the altar, cry: "NIOTACH!" - Action.

<LI>On the knees again, and cry: "I am a humble servant of Chaos!"

<LI>Banishing by hysterical laughter, which is forced to a stop abruptly,
as if catching yourself in a hideous blasphemy.  At the end of the last
performance of the Pilgrim rite, however, the laughter should not be
stopped, but turned toward the idea of being a servant of anything.
