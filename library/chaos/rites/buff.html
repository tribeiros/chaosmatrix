Nick XXXXXX shouted he wanted a ritual, spell, etc. for buffness<P>

<H3>What you'll need:</H3>

<OL>
<LI>an incense of large charcoal briquettes, and a brazier, with a metal
grill upon it, in which to burn it.

<LI>various food items from the four food groups

<LI>a quiet place to go and perform the ritual

<LI>Big heavy metal things
</OL>

<H3>
Ritual:
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Light the incense, and place above it the various food items.
Continue until food is thoughroughly purified.  This provides the spiritual
energy needed to perform the rest of the ritual.
<LI>Pick up the metal things.
<LI>Put down the metal things.
<LI>Assure yourself that you aren't just doingthis because you're insecure
about your penis.
<LI>Repeat a few hundred times.
</UL>

Repeat this ritual on a fairly regular basis. <P>

-- <P>

I hope you realize, that like the world we live in, this ritual is a
joke.<BR>
