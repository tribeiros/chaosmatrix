    A Dream-ritual with the intent to come in contact with Great Cthulhu, an
    excerpt from The Cthulhu Workings, by L.T. Arderman.<BR>

   Cthulhu is the Great Old One sleeping on his submerged island, R'lyeh,
   waiting for the stars to be right, so that he once again can rule the
   world. Cthulhu has been sleeping for aeons, and will, if necessary,
   wait until the end of time. The fiction writer H.P. Lovecraft
   formulated it beautifully in his story, The Call of Cthulhu:<P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE><I>That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange
   aeons even death may die.
   </I></BLOCKQUOTE><P>


   The only way we can communicate with Cthulhu these days, is by the way
   of dreaming. It is mostly one-way communication, as the dream-image of
   Cthulhu is far to overwhelming in its vastness to open for much
   spontaneous response from the dream-recipient.<P>

   The procedure as such is quite simple, but it takes a while of
   rigorous training to be able to perform the ritual without major
   flaws.<P>

   The temple should be decorated in suitable colours, such as black,
   red, deep green and deep blue. If there is a swimming pool in your
   home, perform the ritual there, and if salt is added (in the water),
   the results will be even better. If you have a body- or jumpsuit made
   of green guttaperka, use that for the ritual, or you could paint your
   body blackish-green. A dark-coloured cloak with a hood, made in a
   thick fabric will do as a last resort.<P>

   The ritual should be done at night, or when you go to sleep (as long
   as it's dark), and it is of great importance that you are really,
   really tired; or rather, totally exhausted; both physically, mentally
   and emotionally. You can surely think of several ways to enter this
   state.<P>

   In this state, before you go to bed, read your favourite
   Cthulhu-story, and try to imagine, as strongly as possible, the scenes
   as they unfold before your eyes, BUT DO NOT FALL ASLEEP WHILE YOU ARE
   DOING THIS! This is _very_ important. It helps to focus on the story.
   If you should happen to fall asleep, stop reading, go to bed and do
   the ritual another time.<P>

   After you have finished reading, start to whirl counter-clockwise,
   slowly at first, then faster and faster, while you
   intone/vibrate/shout/scream/roar:<P>

   (The mantras are permutated from the words Cthulhu, R'lyeh, Water,
   Tentacled, & Fhtagn)<P>

   Do this for 10-15 minutes at first; with practice you can increase it
   to 30 minutes or even an hour or two. You will of course become very
   dizzy, but this will diminish with every performance.<P>

   When you are done, go directly to bed, but continue to mumble the
   mantras until you fall into a deep trance-sleep. You will eventually
   be able to repeat the mantras even after you have fallen asleep.<P>

   Sometimes I have found it helpful to make use of a suitable sigil for
   this ritual, decorating the Temple with it and placing one under the
   pillow. If you find this useful, I strongly suggest that you design a
   unique sigil for each and every performance.<P>

   After a while of training, hopefully you will be contacted by Great
   Cthulhu, but don't expect anything for free!<P>
