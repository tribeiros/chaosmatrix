<HR><BR>

A bit of a ritual work in progress here.<BR>

<H3>Demon Square</H3>

A protective magickal device for those who feel uncomfortable
with conventional methods.<BR><BR>

Take 4 candle, in the colours of your choice (needless to
say, the really evil, badass and git'ard of you will go
for black, or perhaps red).<BR><BR>

Set them out in a square around your ritual space, or the
object you wish to confine.<BR><BR>

Some of you may want to align the candles to the
cardinal directions.<BR><BR>

Ignite them in an order you deem appropriate, for each
calling upon a demon or similar to protect you from whatever
you're planning to summon (or whatever).<BR><BR>

Either call upon any patron entities you may have, or
use entities with appropriate directional associations
(such as those offered by LaVey).<BR><BR>

Another option is calling upon entities with associations
opposite to those of an entity you intend to summon (e.g.
lustful demons or gods if you're evoking an angel or
similar being associated with chastity).<BR><BR>

At the termination of your rite, extinguish the candles
in reverse order, thanking the entities for their help.<BR><BR>

Other possibilities related to this method is putting
candles all along the sides of your square, or making
use of the infamous triangle of Choronzon.<BR><BR>
