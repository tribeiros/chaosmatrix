<H1>Rite of Transmutational Sorcery</H1>
<H3>Frater Qoph 100</H3>
<HR>

This working is inspired by the aestheticism of the Mythos of
the Dark Gods and as a model of functioning chaos energy, the
results reached via the method below cause an inner vertigo that
tends to over-ride personality interference and thus an immense
change in conscious perception occurs.<P>

<H3>Method</H3>

The sorceror is to identify with an aspect of 'pure' manifest
chaos, represented in this model by the Cthulhu Mythos entity
AZATHOTH, "blind and idiot force at the centre of infinity".
This invocation is dangerous, but will confer a great deal of
perceptive power to those strong of stomach! The chamber should
be in total darkness. Choose a heavy cloying incense to dim the
ego-senses and meditate upon the presence of AZATHOTH in an awkward
position; one which causes strain or excitement. No instrument
of the Art should be used except for the metaphysical.<P>

In your chosen posture a mantra scream should begin, low and muffled,
coming from the stomach, somewhere near the groin. This should
be felt to tear from the physical body as it emerges from the
throat, becoming increasingly raw, more animalistic as it progresses.
Eventually the scream must rise more frequently and become the
total centre of being as you feel it lift from the dark pit of
your stomach into the dizzy vortex of blackness; ripping you apart,
rending you free; summoning AZATHOTH from the abyss of deepest
dreaming chaos.<P>

<H3>Aids to this Working</H3>

A sigil may be used as the preordained image of the Primal Scream. This
will have the effect of providing an image of Azathoth, though it will be
an abstract, impressionist image. Care should be taken to avoid being
sucked into Azathoth's voidal entity, and this sigil will do the job by
forcing a subjective identity on it which the sorceror may "freeze" and
contain. In this way, the invokation will be limited but more tangibly
successful; the magician becomes an aspect of Azathoth. Such a working is
very dangerous but can go further and is infinite in its drastic
consequences.<P>

Projection into the abyss may be stimulated using hallucinogenic
plants, although great care should be taken in their use.<P>

<H3>Uses of the Rite</H3>

Perception of the very outer limits of consciousness can provide
immense changes to the Ego which will diminish if the invocation
is successful, thus enabling further magickal freedom due to the
intensity of the experience. Directed magickal results may be
obtained by meditating on their fulfilment or sigilized to be
reified by the invocation. Such as: obtaining some material desire,
perception of other worlds, contact with other sorcerors, curing/injuring
physical beings etc; but the main aim of the ritual is to effect
a lasting and devastating change in perceptive consciousness.<P>
