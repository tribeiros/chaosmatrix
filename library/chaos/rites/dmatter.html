<H1>Dark Matter At Hand</H1>
<H2>by Tzimon Yliaster</H2>

<HR>

<H3>Background Noise:</H3>

When physicists calculated the amount of mass necessary to
produce a gravitational force capable of holding our galaxy together
in the face of centrifugal force, they discovered a curious fact.
When they added up the total of all mass existant in the galaxy, they
had only 10% of the mass necessary to keep the Milky Way from
flying apart. To compensate for this, they have theorized the
existence of dark matter. None has of yet been observed; it may or
may not objectively exist.<P>

For this working, however, this debate is entirely unimportant.
We will assume that dark matter exists in one way or another.
Furthermore, we will equate the 90% of "unmanifested" matter with
that 90% of the brain whose purpose and function we have not yet
discovered. Those unknown or unmanifested functions can be
symbolized by the "tip-of-the-tongue" condition, when a word or
phrase comes to mind but cannot be expressed verbally. This is
unmanifested speech, in the same way the dark matter and the
"mystery" 90% are unmanifested.<P>

<H3>Statement of Intent:</H3>
It is my will to manifest that which is potential<BR>
It is my will to find the potential lying in wait<BR>
It is my will to evolve.<P>

NOTE: It is unnecessary, and undesireable, that all participants
recite the statement of intent in unison.<P>

<H3>The Rite</H3>

<OL>
<LI>0. All participants declare:<BR>
XIQUAL WEC!<BR>
ONGO WEC!<BR>
TOMARGO WEC!<P>

Phenomenize dark matter!<BR>
Do dark matter!<BR>
Dark matter by whatever means necessary!<P>

<LI>All participants begin spinning rapidly in place while shouting out
words, letters, or whatever comes to mind. No chain of
association should be followed, and any formof glossalalia is
also valid.<P>

<LI>The spinning and shouting continue until the participants cannot
think of anything else to shout. If this goes beyond the amount of
spinning a participant can tolerate, hishi should lie on the floor on
their back, eyes open, and continue to shout out while hyper-
ventilating.<P>

<LI>Participants now take an ice cube and press it in the space
between their eyes with their eyes closed. The ice cube is held
there until it is entirely melted. Until this happens, all should
remain entirely motionless and in a state of no-mind.<P>

<LI>When the ice cube has melted, the participants should stand up
and scream out:<P>

What was hidden has been found!<BR>
From the darkness to the light!<BR>
What was silent now is sound!<P>

(pause and draw a deep breath)<P>

What is mine is mind to keep!<BR>
From the darkness to the light!<BR>
Preconception go to sleep!<P>

(pause and draw three deep breaths)<P>

From within the dark earth grows<BR>
From the darkness to the light!<BR>
Transmute nobo wec to wec nobo<P>

(pause and draw nine deep breaths)<P>

<LI>Banish by laughter and do not record or seek to remember any
detail of your experience until you note the "spontaneous"
manifestation of some new ability or unsually intense inspiration.
If this does not occur by the time you have completely forgotten
ever having performed this rite, then perform it again.<P>
