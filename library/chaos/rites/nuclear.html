Well kiddies, I always remember seeing listings for elementals (undine,
gnome, salamander and sylph) and I've always thought they were too safe
for my liking. Sure they are the traditional elements, but what about the
"new" elements that we have discovered like nuclear force, electric and
electromagnetic force, gravity and such. Well I've decided to write down
these rituals as they come to me that will summon forth elementals of
these "new" forces. <P>

<H3>Purpose:</H3>

To evoke the power of a nuclear elemental and have it manifest
for 5 minutes.<P>

<H3>Ingredients:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>U238
<LI>A piece of lead
<LI>A sigil you create
<LI>Human flesh
<LI>High tension power lines
<LI>An Ipecac
<LI>Several razors
<LI>Matches
<LI>Something flammable
</UL>

<H3>Beginning:</H3>

Take with you what you can find or obtain. Having the U238 would be
helpful but it should be unnecessary. Find an area in relative isolation
where there is a whole row of high tension power lines that preferably
eminate from a nuclear plant. If this cannot be accomplished, cover
yourself with an electric blanket. <P>

Take the piece of lead and place upon it a sigil of your own creation,
dedicating one side to Azathoth, the other side to Homer Simpson. <P>

Several days before the ritual, begin to avoid drinking water as much as
possible, comb your hair daily and harshly! pulling out strands by the
dozen. Brush your teeth until the gums are raw and bleeding. On the night
of the ritual, take care not to clean the blood off your teeth and bring
the hair you take from your brush with you as well. As much as possible,
try to physically emulate the effects of radiation poisoning short of
actually getting it. <P>

On the night of the ritual, go to the site you chose/found for it after
consuming an ipecac (something vile that will make you throw up violently,
grass mixed into mustard works, also toothpaste in peppermint ice cream,
fruitloops and pork mixed into strawberry Quik, raw eggs combined with
chocolate and rocks etc...) holding back the biliousness that is filling
your stomach. If you can't, then take the ipecac at the ritual making sure
that you will vomit at the ritual. <P>

<H3>Ritual</H3>

Start a good sized fire underneath the high tension power lines, in the
steel tubing structure, let it grow in strength of a good campfire. Walk
away from the fire, letting your mind be filled with the fire and only the
fire. Take the razors and stick them into your flesh, letting them jut
there as you bleed on yourself. Consume the ipecac now if you haven't
already. Begin to chant anything. Close your eyes and begin
visualization. <P>

Visualize in the fire that fills your mind, a seething white heat that
pulsates. <P>

Visualize it filling your being. Feel the biliousness in your stomach. <P>

Feel the biliousness become a cancer, it's tumor forcing it's way up your
oesophagus<P>

Tilt your head back towards the wires high over you, concentrating,
feeling the electromagnetic radiation tear the iron out of your blood
through the razors. Feel the radiation making the tumor grow. Prepare to
perform the technicolor yawn. <P>

At the moment when you can no longer hold back the vomit, when you start
hocking up chunks even tho you're trying to choke it back, run to the fire
and let it all out. Feel the tumor being thrown from you. Wipe the blood
from your body and throw it into the fire. Throw the hair into the fire if
you have it. <P>

Visualize the tumor being enveloped by the fire, the fire shifting to a
bright blue flame not unlike that of a butane torch. <P>

The blue flame rises, glowing. It becomes human shaped. <P>

Shout at it, never flinching, until it cowers before you. <P>

Give it your instructions to carry out your will. It will perform them
when suitably subdued. <P>

<H3>Dismissal</H3>

Take the piece of lead with Azathoth/Homer Simpson. Call the elemental.
When the elemental arrives, take the piece of lead and shove it in your
tight fist and punch the elemental deep in where it's heart should be.
Visualize the lead blocking the elemental's power center, absorbing the
power. Remove thine fist. The elemental should flicker out, the piece of
lead falling to the floor. <P>
