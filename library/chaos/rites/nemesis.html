<H1>The Nemesis Conjuration</H1>

<HR>

In this ritual the Greek Goddess Nemesis, a deity of fate and
vengeance, is seen in the role of being the complementary opposite
of ones ego referring to the inner self as the centre of both
personalitties. Habits and actions taken against ones real desires
create the opposite to the same degree and thereby form an
anti-personality of ones ego, which in this case is identified
with the principle of Nemesis.<P>

Disturbances on the plane of reality due to actions against ones
subconscious desires can be eliminated by ritual union with this
personal demon-sister/brother and enable one to reach ones inner
self, which is defined as the mean value of both the personalities.
The effect of this ritual, if performed correctly, would by
definition be fatal. Therefore the operation is strictly limited
to the part of the psyche which the magician wishes to explore.
A sigil representing this portion of the psyche is forcibly
activated during the ritual in order that the magician may
seek answers to his problems within the chosen area in the
personality. No specific wishes or desires can be used for this
purpose, only general ones. This is a necessary restriction to
avoid being overwhelmed by any unpleasant effects. The magician
should be aware of this when constructing the sigil.<P>

<LI>The ritual is performed sitting on the ground in the posture
  of the Rune PERDRO. The head may rest on the lower part of the
  arms, and the face should be covered by the cowl of the robe.<P>

<LI>Statementof intent: IT IS MY WILL TO TAKE A STEP TOWARDS THE
  CENTRE OF MY SELF BY UNION WITH MY OPPOSITE THROUGH THIS SIGIL!<P>

<LI>The incantation is given while visualising a winged figure of
  opposite sex who approaches the magician. The figure wears the
  chosen sigil on his/her breast and is both beautiful and
  terrifying at the same time.<P>

<LI>Incantation:<P>

<PRE>
  Come to me oh Nemesis, mighty, terrifying and beloved sister.

  Come to me oh Nemesis, you, who are the goddess of my god,
                         you, who are the demon of my demon.

  Come to me oh Nemesis, you, who are the demon of my god,
                         you, who are the goddess of my demon.

  Come to me oh Nemesis, you, who are part of me which I am not,
                         you, who are the counterbalance on the
                         scales of my fate.

  Come to me oh Nemesis, you, whose wings carry us to our
                         mutual central Kia.

  Come to me oh Nemesis, you, who are my ultimate fear,
                         you, who are my ultimate desire.
                         you, with whom to unite is the sigh of
                         ecstacy and the silence of death.

  Come to me oh Nemesis, for you are my path and I am our aim
                         I call upon you to meet me in this sigil.

  Come to me oh Nemesis  and guide me through this sigil to our
                         mutual central Kia!</PRE><P>

  Start hyperventilation during the reading out of the incantation.
  The visualised figure with the sigil coming closer and closer to
  finally melt into your own body. When this point is reached
  shout out:<P>

  ZodACAM VaPAAHe ANANAEL ZoDA Ah!<BR>
  (I move the wings of the secret wisdom within me!)<P>

<LI>Banishing and/or laughter.
