---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a tried and successful working which, I think, could be easily
adapted for use on the Internet. Waddya think?

SIGNAL WORKING
a random act of infomagick

All of us are aware of the power of subliminal messaging,
the basic premise of which is not unlike that of sigil magick.
Both affect us in the same way, i.e. by tapping the powers of
the mind at some non-conscious level. The source of power, as
far as the conscious mind, then, is in that it does not know from
where/in what way the message has been received. Subliminal
messaging relies on mass appeal to achieve the intended
success of whomever originates the message and, when such a
message reaches critical mass in terms of those heeding it,
what was a "subjective" idea may well become an "objective"
reality.

The object of this working is to establish an idea, whether it
is to be believed initially or not, in the minds of randomly
selected targets. As it is virtually impossible to know what the
"critical mass" is for a given idea, the number 3 has arbitrarily
been assigned; the actual number is left for the worker to
decide. Note that the targets will not be aware, in all likelihood,
of what the idea being given them is. Herein again lies the
subliminal component.

THE WORKING

0. Begin with a banishing ritual, and use it to banish all thoughts
except for the idea to be sent.

1. Statement of intent: "I will that (insert idea here) manifest!"

2. From the statement of intent, create a sigil and
accompanying mantra.

3. Make 3 copies of the sigil and mantra.

4. After having charged the sigil, preferably reaching gnosis by
repeating the mantra, fold the paper with the original sigil,
and put in a copious quantity of sweet-smelling incense. Burn
the paper now, in such a way that the smoke goes outward
from the area in which you are working.

5. Randomly select 3 addresses from a phone book; mail off
the 3 copies of the sigil and mantra to them. Do not put a
return address on them.

6. Go to the telephone and randomly dial 3 telephone numbers.
When there is an answer, say the mantra. Continue
repeating until the other party hangs up.

7. Anokquz

Note: Other means of conveying the idea via the mantra
suggest themselves as well; one could certainly repeat it
to strangers face-to-face, as long as one is sure that they
will not later be identified by a mutual acquaintance. Any
means of communication may be used in place of or in
addition to those specifically mentioned.
