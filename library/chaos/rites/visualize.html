<I>Thanks for the post, I was just about to go web-hunting
for something just like this...<BR><BR>

I needed a simple excercise just like this to "break-in"
a group who's never practiced together; kind of a
warm-up before our first big ritual...<BR><BR>

Anyway, thanks again for the ritual,
as well as the synchronicity weirdness.

Yer quite welcome, that's what the list is for...Your note about
synchronicity reminds me of one of the first things I distinctly
remember writing in my magickal journal..."Coincidence can be
summoned."  ;&gt;<BR><BR>

And you're right that those exercises should work well for a group--
I've used them in the context of various classes and working groups
from time to time, and they seem to work for a lot of folks.  Another
simple, classic good one (which works best, however, with a group
used to working together, but can still be an interesting exercise
with any group of magickal folk), is the following:<BR><BR>

For warm-up, start by having the group hold hands in a circle, facing
inwards.  Do some form of individual or facilitated grounding
exercise (can be as simple as taking time to listen to the hissing in
your ears, your own heartbeat, your breathing pattern, etc., or get
as elaborate as you wish), concentrating specifically on the feel of
your own personal energy, while peripherally remaining aware of the
hands you hold on either side.  Alternately, especially if the group
is composed of inexperienced folk, do the grounding exercise in the
circle but without holding hands, then join hands after you're done
and everyone is well "into themselves."   Next, slowly, expand your
awareness to the people on either side, taking plenty of time, and
making sure to remain aware of your own self.  Listen to their
breathing, take time and sense what they feel like, smell like,
energetically feel (what one friend, Sienna, calls, "pheel") like,
etc.  When that's done, expand your awareness again to the people
next to those two people...and so on, until you've gotten all the way
around the circle.   If you want to take the time, when you've gone
all the way around, you can pass an energy ball around the circle,
again slowly, at least at first, speeding it up if folks feel like
playing.  If folks don't know how to make/pass an energy ball, try
squeezing the hand of the person next to you, passing a long, slow
squeeze, all the way around the circle, and it'll probably start to
happen on its own.<BR><BR>

Now, for the exercise.  Have one person in the group stand in the
center of the rest, who all face inward towards the person in the
middle, hands down.  The middle person is blindfolded, or just closes
their eyes.   Then, one person on the outside is selected to be the
"sender."  Their job is to, without touching the person in the
middle, project energy towards them, using whatever visualization or
other method is most natural for them-- extending, projecting,
whatever, so long as it's not audible or otherwise physically sensed
by the middle person.  The middle person's job is to sense what
direction the energy is coming from, and turn towards it.  If time
allows, everyone should have a chance to be the sender, and everyone
should take a turn in the middle.  If folks are having too easy a
time of it, have the "sender" switch one or more times during the
course of each person's time in the middle-- after a bit of practice
(or sooner if anyone is a "natural"), you'll have people spinning
around and zeroing in like the needle in a compass.   More common is
a lot of slow rotating, "sniffing," while people try to get used to
sensing who's actively projecting, versus who's just unintentionally
splooshing all over the place, etc.   Afterwards (this is important),
have everyone share their experiences, what they felt, sensed, what
visualizations they used as sender and receiver, etc., whether or not
they got it "right."  One person's visualization technique while
sending or receiving may well help others.  Share the wealth ;&gt;<BR><BR>

This is the simple version-- you can take this basic exercise in a
lot of different directions.  If you use it, let me know how it goes,
okay?<BR><BR>

Just as the Winged Energy of Delight

Just as the winged energy of delight
carried you over many chasms early on,
now raise the daringly imagined arch
holding up the astounding bridges.

Miracle doesn't lie only in the amazing
living through and defeat of danger;
miracles become miracles in the clear
achievement that is earned.

To work with things is not hubris
when building the associations beyond words;
denser and denser the pattern becomes--
being carried along is not enough.

Take your well-disciplined strengths
and stretch them between two
opposing poles.  Because inside human beings
is where God learns.
