<H1>Milosh's Triangular Veins Ward</H1>


This ward is primarily used to prevent passage of entities through any firm
surface, but it can be also used to permanently block doors, or prevent
opening of closets, chests or envelopes. It is rather simple to place, and
is extremely powerful.<BR><BR>

<B>Placing the ward:</B><BR><BR>

1. Using the index finger of your right hand, point to a spot in the lower
left quarter of the area to be warded, vibrating "IEAOU." Visualize the spot
glowing with octarine light. Place the right hand palm outward about one
inch over the spot (as if you wished to push the surface there), and vibrate
"ZOS."<BR><BR>

2. Pointing to the center of upper half of the are to be warded, vibrate
"IEAOU" again, and repeat the octarine visualization. Place your hand over
the spot as before, and vibrate "KIA."<BR><BR>

3. Pointing to a spot in the lower right quarter of the area to be warded,
vibrate "IEAOU" again, and repeat the octarine visualization. Place your
hand over the spot as before, and vibrate "IKKHA." The three spots should
now make an equlateral triangle in the approximate center of the warded
area.<BR><BR>

4. Place yoour hand, palm outward, over the center of the triangle and say
"XIQUAL." Visualise pulsating veins of light (usualy octarine, but color
depends on the purpose) spreading from under your hand, branching through
the surface and covering the entire ward area in an impenetrable tangle.<BR><BR>

5. Turn your back to the ward, and say "SYCUZ."<BR><BR>

<B>Elaboration:</B><BR><BR>

The Veins have originaly been designed to protect an area with walls, idealy
a room, from any incursion. They can be broken by force, but will neither
wear off in time, nor will they ever require renewing or reenergizing.
Placing one of this wards on every surface (all four walls, ceiling and
floor, making sure you do not block the doors and windows, which require
more selective and less permanent wards) will make those surfaces sealed
forever (or until something REALLY strong uses a LOT of power to break
through, or until their physical base is physicaly destroyed). For this
insulative purpose, veins should be visualized in the octarine color of the
casting Mage.<BR><BR>

Another use is to place a trap on a door or any closed item. For example,
you can place the triangle over a door, extending the veins to the walls.
Whoever opens the door will break the ward, causing a quite powerful
explosion of whatever force the casting Mage has put into the triangle.
Veins for this purpose are visualized in red or black (with spots of the
triangle usualy visualized red or black too) - red if you wish to extend an
energy strike, black for an entropy explosion. Explosion is a quite literal
word here: breaking the ward will extend the damage to everyone who finds
themselves within few yards of the breaking point. Keep in mind that this is
not much different from a land mine, and take care not to stumble into your
own trap.<BR><BR>

A note about physical base. Veins can be put to "float in the air," but in
that case they fold down and dissolve very quickly. Also, the total power
depends also on the physical size of the ward, besides the amount of energy
casting Mage has put into it; a warded envelope sent to an enemy will cause
relatively little harm when opened, while a well-made triangulated door can
easily dispatch a killing blow. I have no idea why this is so, it is simply
an observation.<BR><BR>

Placing more then one protective triangle on the same surface will make the
defense weaker instead of stronger - veins will fight each other, creating
separate areas around each triangle, with holes in between. If you place two
triangles so their sides intersect, they will cancel each other almost
immediately. Placing more then one trap-triangle on same surface is a bad
way to commit suicide; touching one set of trap-veins with another will
cause them both to explode on the spot.<BR><BR>

The ward can be easily specialized by adding sigils to the triangle; for
instance, you can place a watcher sigil within a trap triangle, so that you
know when the trap has been sprung. You can add defensive sigils and runes,
or create a defensive spider-servitor to make things more interesting...your
imagination is the only limit.<BR><BR>

Have fun,<BR><BR>
