<HR>

Although startlingly simple (as are most potent systems) Dream Recall is a
very effective method of gaining control over dreamtime. In it's ultimate
form it can reveal areas of Magical Memory and much initiated work can be
done vhilst in dream state, including lucid-dreaming wherein the dreamer
is semi-conscious and can 'observe' the dream without affecting it; being
carried away and noting every happening in the dream itself,
objectively.<P>

The Dream Recall Technique has also been termed Reverse Remembering. The
mind makes thousands of decisions every day. It does this automatically
and in 'forward-thinking' mode. If you are asked to remember a list of
groceries you always remember the one at the top of the list first and
then 'chain' them together. When re-membering them you begin at no.1 and
move down the list. The mind automatically thinks this way. However just
because this fits into our mundane life more efficiently does not mean
that the mind is limited to thinking linearly. Not so. The mind can be
taught to remember in reverse sequence by command, although it does take
some effort on behalf of the operator. Try counting from 100 down to zero
for example. You have to <I>think</I> and put effort into the result,
whereas counting from zero to 100 you do not think, it is <I>automatically
accomplished by familiarisation.</I> Of course there is a limit to what we
can accomplish by sequential remembering in the forward mode. Eventually
we run out of things to remember because they have not yet happened. We
then have to move into clairvoyant realms. However in reverse remembering
we can continue much deeper and farther into the realms of experience and
Being and pull out of our memories information and data which can really
help us in our daily lives. lt helps if the mind is in a state of repose
when this reverse remembering goes on and the best results are when allied
with sleep although once adept at it you can reverse-remember at any
peaceful time.<P>

The knack of reverse remembering is time-phased and memory-phased. That is
to say that you can trace back and reverse remember all that has gone on
in your mind the night previously. You can also reverse remember previous
lives. The key to attempting reverse remembering is simply
familiarization. To begin with reverse remembering is very difficult.
Within a week you will be absolutely amazed at the progress you have made
and after several months it will become second nature and will be
available to you at will.<P>

The most successful exercises in reverse remembering is the following:<P>

Just prior to going to sleep close your eyes and try and think of what you
did before you got into bed, Make a detailed memory-picture of every
action and statement in <I>reverse order</I> from laying your head down to
climbing the stairs. As you move along in your mind things will become
more and more difficult to remember and most beginners lose track after
half a dozen 'remem-brances'. You may find you have dropped off to sleep
upon waking up in the morning. PERSIST in this exercise every night
reverse remember. The more you attempt it the more successful you will be.
It <I>will</I> become easier. Whilst you are training yourself in this you
must also keep a notepad and pencil beside your bed. In the morning sit up
sharp; before anything else has entered your mind and remember bk to
whilst you were asleep. You will find to begin with that this is VERY
difficult but persistence will prove successful. You will find that your
first success comes when you <I>reverse remember</I> a particularly strong
emotional sequence in a dream. Once you have dixed upon this then FORWARD
REMEMBER from that point. When you have completed this as far as you can
go and put all this down on paper, then switch concentration back to the
first part of the dream and reverse remember. This is the most difficult
task of all for it takes much effort and only by parts do you succeed
initially. However the prize you are after is worth it and even part
success is stupendous when it occurs. Once you have mastered this part
improvement will flow quickly. lt will not be long before you can 'map'
out the highlights of the psychic work you have 'subconsciously' done
during the night and truly begin to benefit from the third of your life
you normally waste 'asleep'.<P>

Some "daylight" exercises to help you with your reverse remembering are:
<P>

<OL>

<LI>Learn to count backwards f rom 100 to zero as quickly as you can from
zero to 100

<LI>Use the old child's game of having someone show you a tray with around
30 small objects thereon, (or a limited period. Then try and re-member
them. As you get better, have more objects or/and less time to view them.

<LI>Take 20 playing cards. Shuffle them. Remember their sequence after
looking through them once. As you get better increase the number of cards.
When you get really good reverse remember the cards after looking through
them the other way.

<LI>This is a variation on (3) of help to beginners. Take a glossy
magazine. Look at each page and memorise the <I>pictures</I> on each page
from front cover to back cover then put the book down and re-member from
back cover to front cover.
