<H1>Azathoth/mainframe rite</H1>
<H2>by Fireclown (monasteros@aol.com)<BR></H2>

<HR>

<B>Thee following should be taken as spoken only if relevant to your
question! I believe it, because it works for me! Use at will!
Alter! Discard!</B><P>


<B>Thee Transient Azathoth Zone-</B><BR>

Wherein we have Deeds with the B.I.G. (Blind Idiot God) Thing that Lurks
in the Heart of Chaos. Azathoth is described as 'Blind' It is Eyeless, it
Reads and Writes with magnet and laser upon and from thee Whirling Disks
fed into, or, in the case of the True Believers, those who could not stand
to be apart from It, Built into Its Very Body!!! Great (B.I.G.) Azathoth,
yeah, it's an Idiot God! It's an Idiot Savant God! You give it the Proper
Words of Power, TELNET-FTP-WWW, for example, and it spews forth, well,
spew. Like I said, It cannot Understand What It Hath Read, for it is
Mighty. It is Many-Bodied and many Tentacled, feeding tubes stretched
accross our world in twisted Leys (Leys= leis, Hawwaiian offerings to the
aliens, symbolizing the Sacred Noose. Hello! Goodbye!). It has been said
somewhere, (INSERT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFO HERE) that Azathoth dances to 'the
piping of Idiot Saxaphones'-wow! how did they get a saxaphone into the
little box that sings Its Arcane Tune, forcing benediction from That which
Lieth Beyond the Beyond to speaketh with me? Ask not that which thou does
not care about! Choose &lt;CONNECT&gt;, if that is your Will, and be done
with it. <P>

The Rite: (note that directions in these Aethyrs shift, and what
worked last week may no longer hold true)<P>

Props needed-
<UL>
<LI>Incense only if you hate it. Otherwise, something else you hate. I
use onions.
<LI>Sigil of Target Mainframe
<LI>Sign of your Will to destroy
<LI>Computer, conected and with Line open to Target (not really
neccessary or reccomended)
</UL>

Banish if you're pervy and into that kind of thing, otherwise,
relax, stretch out the body, get loosend up, in prep for getting
LOOSE. When you feel centred, relaxed, and slightly sexy, begin
relevant Mantra Of Opening the Connection. (all examples are
merely that and should be altered according to need or desire)<P>

Vibrate, sonorously:<BR>
NICFUNETFI<BR>
NICFUNETFI<BR>
NICFUNETFI...<P>

continue until mild to severe gnosis is entered at which point, on the
Indrawn breath, Indraw AZATHOTH... so now you are running a cycle of<P>

&gt;NICFUNETFI&lt;AZATHOTH&gt;NICFUNETFI&lt;AZATHOTH&gt;NICFUNETFI&lt;etc..<P>

until the edges blur and you move into appropriate
level of possesion (you know, massive trembling, glosslalia,
vomiting)<P>

Now, you should be experiencing a shifting possesion, of the
mainframe, and Azathoth. Let this blur into a state of loss
of differetiation.<P>

Charge the Sigil of the Target<P>

when charging is a tangible state<P>

Charge Sign of your Will to Destroy<P>

ignite incense, or ingest the Hateful Onion<P>

Focus your disgust and hatred of the Hateful thing into
the combined Sigil and Sign. Eat the Material bases,
Laugh uproriously, and close the Temple.<P>

Thy will be done.<P>
