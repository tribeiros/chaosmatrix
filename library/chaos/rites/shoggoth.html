This is a short essay on a rite I developed. It seems quite effective.
Indeed it was MUCH more effective than I anticipated. It rapidly showed
itself to be a powerful but potentially dangerous magickal working.
Unfortunately it is written entirely in a male context. I did not wish to
speculate on how to adapt this rite for use by female mages. I'm sure
that they are very capable of doing this themselves and would almost
certainly do a better job.

According to HPL Shoggoths were (originally) mindless creatures created
as servants/slaves by the Great Old Ones. They could assume whatever form
their master wished in order to perform their task. Shoggoths are unruly
servants becoming more intelligent and rebellious the longer the are
employed. Eventually they may attempt to destroy their masters. HPL also
wrote that Shoggoths are sometimes seen in visions from hallucinogenic
plants.

Magickal traditions from around the world contain formula for creating
magickal creatures as slaves/servants. These creatures can be created in
what ever shape is needed or desired by the magician. These magickal
creatures are called "Tulpas" or "thought-forms" by the Tibetans. In
"Mystery and Magic in Tibet" Alexandra David-Neal tells how she created
such a Tupla as an experiment. The Tupla became more and more independent
and troublesome as time went on. Eventually Ms. David-Neal had to
discontinue the experiment because of the Tulpa's growing power. Mr. G.H.
Estabrooks in his book "Hypnotism" writes of his attempts to create a
self-hypnotic pet polar bear. "The technique of autosuggestion is
difficult, but it can be mastered. Once the subject has obtained this
mastery he will find that not only can he produce, say, hallucinations in
the trance itself but can actually suggest posthypnotic hallucinations to
himself. It does sound weird but it can be done. . . . Auto suggestion
gives us an excellent device with which to study many strange things. The
writer had a 'pet' polar bear which he was able to call up merely be
counting to five. This animal would parade around the hospital ward in
most convincing fashion, over and under the beds, kiss the nurses and bit
the doctors. It was very curious to note how obedient he was to 'mental'
commands, even jumping off a three story window on demand.
But auto suggestion has a certain menace which this phantom bear
illustrated. He became so familiar that he refused to go away. He would
turn up in the most unexpected places and without being sent for. The
writer was playing bridge one evening and almost through his hosts into
hysterics by suddenly remarking, 'There's that damn bear again. I wish
someone would shoot the beast.' He also had a nasty habit of turning up
in dark corners at night, all very well when one realized he was just
made of ghoststuff but rather hard on ones' nerves for all that. So he
was banished and told never to return. It was fully a month before the
writer felt quit sure that his ghostly form would not be grinning at him
over the foot of his bed during a thunderstorm. "
The magickal and shamanic writings of the world also record the
way in which magickally created entities can become independent and
troublesome. Sometimes even dangerously rebellious. Tibetan Buddhists
and shamans from around the globe say that these "thought forms" or
magickal creatures can be seen when in the gnostic state caused by
entheogenic plants. Thus we can see that these Tulpas (sometimes called
egregors in western traditions) are closely related to HPL's Shoggoths.
Both Shoggoths and Tulpas are created entities. Both are servants or
slaves and can assume any form needed by their masters. They both can
become rebellious. Shoggoths as well as Tulpas are sometimes seen after
ingesting entheogenic plants. Thus I think that there is a fairly firm
link between HPL's Shoggoths and the thought-form entities of Magick and
Shamanism.

Creating a Shoggoth

In this section we'll look at some practical considerations related to
creating a Shoggoth (thought-form entity). There were many techniques for
creating thought-forms throughout the history of magick and shamanism.
We must consider which of this multitude of techniques is most
appropriate for magickally creating a Lovecraftian Shoggoth.

The word Shoggoth is, according to Kenneth Grant, related to the Chaldean
word "shaggathai". Shaggathai translates as "fornication" and provides a
significant clue as to what methodology should be employed. "Beth
Shaggathai" which means "House of Fornication" may be related to or even
a progenitor of HPL's "Pit of Shoggoths". The idea of a link between
"Shaggathai" (fornication) and Shoggoth is not as strange as it might
first seem. The use of sexual energy in creating thought-form entities is
a particularly old and powerful technique.

This technique is particularly suited for creating violently powerful and
unpredictable entities such a Shoggoths. Indeed poltergeist phenomena are
almost without fail associated with to pubescent children. The upheaval
and dynamic release of sexual energy at puberty can, especially in the
emotionally disturbed or repressed, result in a "poltergeist". Thus it
might seem that techniques using sexual energy are, perhaps, the most
suited for creating a Shoggoth. The classical technique involves direct
manipulation the sexual fluids to create the thought-form entity. HPL's
description of a formless Shoggoth as a viscous mass of protoplasm seems
reminiscent of this technique. Some of the formula for creating a
Homunculus are particularly potent forms of this methodology. A medieval
prescription for making a homunculus was to place manure in a vessel to
which the magician would add his sperm three times accompanied with the
appropriate word formula and visualizations. This process would begin the
entity's existence. Next the magician would place drops of his own blood
in the vessel each day for forty days. At the end of these forty days the
Homunculus would be mature and allowed to exit the vessel. This technique
is particularly powerful and dangerous because of the use of blood. The
magician must always use only his own blood. This is because the blood of
others can be very difficult to control. However, this technique is still
dangerous and difficult to control even when using one's own blood. The
escaping energy from the blood can be directly manipulated to incarnate
the entity. Indeed HPL in "The Dunwich Horror" says that certain entities
"can not take body without human blood." The use of ones own blood is a
dangerous technique that should not be attempted by novices. The above
formula for creating a Homunculus will be adapted below as a method for
generating a Shoggoth.

The Rite

You must first decide the function that the Shoggoth will serve. Once you
have determined what the task of the Shoggoth will be you must create a
sigil that represents this purpose.

Prepare a container with the Sign of the Elders on the outside of the lid
and the talisman of Yhe on the inside surface of the lid. Place the sigil
on the bottom surface of the container.

You must choose a form for the Shoggoth to assume that is both consistent
with its task and with the nature of Shoggoths in general. (H. R. Giger's
works are a good source for Shoggothic images.)

Place the container on an altar dedicated to Shub-Niggurath.
(Shub-Niggurath is chosen because of the Black Goat's association with
fertility and thus creating new life.) The working space should also be
set up with the colors (black and brown), symbols (goat, tree, inverse
pentagram, etc.), and sounds (a recording of a goat baying and drumming
work very well), etc., associated with Shub-Niggurath.

The magician begins the Rite thus:
Facing the altar he takes up his dagger and inscribes his circle
(normally a magick circle is not used in Cthulhu oriented magick.
However, in rite we must endeavor to keep any unwanted influences from
removing energy from the Shoggoth or swaying the direction of the rite)
He then returns the dagger to its place on the altar. He faces the
physical representation of Shub-Niggurath and declares:

"Shub-Niggurath is the Lord of the Woods. From the Wells of Night to the
Gulfs of Space, and from the Gulfs of Space to the Wells of Night, ever
the praises of Great Cthulhu, of Tsathogguau, and of Him Who is not to be
Named. Ever their praises and abundance to the Black Goat of the Woods.
Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat with a Thousand Young!"

"Shub-Niggurath, Great Lord of the Woods, giver of Life, bestow your
productivity to this rite. Confer your fertility. The portents of your
fecundity are rejoiced. Ever praises to Shub-Niggurath the Black Goat of
the Woods. Ia! Shub-Niggurath."

The Magician now removes his (black) robes and opens the container and
begins to stimulate himself as he faces the sigil of the Shoggoth. He
should carefully visualize the form chosen for the Shoggoth in the
container. As the energy builds he should envision the energy going into
the Shoggoth vivifying it. Deliberate over-breathing can be used to
strengthen the ASC and energy of the rite. As the point of orgasm
approaches the magician calls forth:

"(Name chosen for the Shoggoth)! Come forth!"

As he climaxes he should allow his mind to be overwhelmed by the
sensations, eliminating completely (as possible) conscious thought. In
this blank state of mind the Sigil (which the magician should be looking
at) is the UNconscious focus and directs the energy. The magician allows
his sexual fluids to land on the Sigil energizing it and incarnating the
Shoggoth.

After this the container is shut and the magician says:

"Thanks and praises to Shub-Niggurath The Black Goat."

"Ia! Shub-Niggurath"

He then makes the Sign of Koth followed by the Elder Sign. He then
closes this portion of the rite in his customary fashion.

The above process should be repeated three times on three days (the may
or may not be consecutive). The next stage of the rite is "feeding" the
Shoggoth. Again, a magick-circle is advisable. The magician should enter
whatever form of excitatory gnosis he feels suitable. Next, the magician
opens the container with his left hand and makes the Elder Sign with his
right hand. He then takes up his dagger and draws a small amount of
blood. As the blood drops on the Sigil he calls forth:

"(Shoggoth's name)!, I command you to feed and grow powerful so that you
may serve my will!"
"I command you to feed and grow powerful so that you may serve my will!"
"I command you to feed and grow powerful so that you may serve my will!"
"(Name)! Drink my blood and take body!"

As he does this he VERY INTENSELY visualizes the form of the Shoggoth. If
he wishes he can envision the Shoggoth growing slightly. "Imagining" the
Shoggoths form clearly is VERY important to the success of this rite.
Each time this is repeated the image of the Shoggoth should become more
and more clear and independent. As the days pass the Shoggoth should seem
to appear as soon as the container is opened before the magician even
tries to visualize it. This process is repeated every day for 37 more
days. The entire rite takes forty days to complete. On the last day,
after "feeding" it, the magician commands the Shoggoth thus:

"(Name)!, I command you to leave your receptacle. Enter the world and
perform your task as I will. Go forth and (state the task assigned to the
Shoggoth). SO I COMMAND!"

He then makes the Voorish Sign and destroys the talisman of Yhe and the
Sign of the Elders on the lid of the container. If the function of the
Shoggoth is fairly permanent (i.e., a Guardian of a location or object)
the Shoggoth may need periodic "recharging" This can be done with either
sexual energy or any other method of imparting magickal energy the mage
deems fit.

The Shoggoth should be VERY powerful as thought-form entities go. It
should also be (or rapidly become) fairly independent and capable of
autonomous action. With continued existence and use the Shoggoth will
seem to develop its own "personality" and can become troublesome. If the
Shoggoth becomes rebellious it may be necessary for the magician to
destroy the Shoggoth. A standard but thorough banishing and the
destruction of the Sigil should suffice.

Any comments or suggestions welcomed.

This rite should not be attempted by novices!

Please post or e-mail me with any results if you attempt this rite.

Best Regards
