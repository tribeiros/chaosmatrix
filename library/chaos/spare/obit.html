<H1>Austin Osman Spare's Obituary</H1>
<H3>The Times, 1956</H3>

AUSTIN SPARE, an artist of unusual gifts and attainments and of an even
more unusual personality, died on May 15th 1956, in hospital in London at
the age of 67.<P>

A dreamer of dreams and a seer of visions, he had that complete
other-worldliness so often depicted in romantic fiction and so rarely
found in real life. Money meant nothing to him. With his talents as a
figure draughtsman he might easily have commanded a four-figure income in
portraitive, but he elected to live quietly and humbly, rarely going out,
painting what he wished to paint, and selling his works at three or four
guineas each. Even in outward aspect he conformed to type - with his
untidy shock of hair, small imperial, and a scarf instead of a collar. But
for most of his fife he did not mix in what are called `artistic circles'.
Not Chelsea, Fitzroy Street, Bloomsbury or Hampstead claimed him, but for
years a little fiat `in the south suburbs by the Elephant' far removed
from the coteries, deep-set in the ordinary life of the people.<P>

Austin Osman Spare was born in Snow Hill, near Smithfield Market, London
on December 31 1888, the son of Philip Newton Spare, A City of London
policeman.  Leaving his elementary school at the age of 13, he took his
higher education into his own hands, working not only at art but at
general subjects, in particular the occult. He had some formal tuition at
the Lambeth School of Art and the Royal College of Art. He was already
exhibitioning at the Royal Academy at the age of 16, but in later years
ceased to send anything there. In July 1914 he had his first one-man
exhibition at the Bailie Gallery, showing a number of his so-called
'psychic' drawings and some very powerful generalizations of animal
nature. <P>

Just after the 1914-1918 War Spare became friendly with John Austen and
Alan Odle, figure draughtsmen differing considerably from him and from
each other, but each having certain aims in common with his. From October
1922 to July 1924 Spare edited, jointly with Clifford Bax, a sumptuously
produced quarterly called the Golden Hind for Chapman and Hall. It
collapsed for lack of support, but during its brief career it reproduced
in large scale some really superb figure drawing and lithographs by Spare
and others. In 1925 Spare, Odle, Austen, and Harry Clarke showed together
at the St George's Gallery, and in 1930 at the Godfrey Philips
Galleries.<P>

Thereafter Spare was rarely found in the purlieus of Bond St. He would
teach a little from January to June, then up to the end of October, would
finish various works, and from the beginning of November to Christmas
would hang his products in the living-room, bedroom, and kitchen of his
flat in the Borough. There he kept open house; critics and purchasers
would go down, ring the bell, he admitted, and inspect the pictures, often
in the company of some of the models - working women of the neighbourhood.
Spare was convinced that there was a great potential demand for pictures
at 2 or 3 guineas each, and condemned the practice of asking L20 for
"amateurish stuff'. He worked chiefly in pastel or pencil, drawing
rapidly, often taking no mon than two hours over a picture. He was
especially interested in delineating the old, and had various models over
70 and one as old as 93.<P>

During the last war, while on fire watching duty, he was blown up and
temporarily lost the use of both arms. His memory was also affected, but
in 1946 in a cramped basement in Brixton, he began to make pictures again,
starting, as he said, from scratch. In 1947 an exhibition of no less than
163 of the pictures he had painted in the previous few months attracted
many people to the Archer Gallery, in Westbourne Grove.<P>

Spare's alleged `automatic' and `psychic' drawings tended to lack
discipline, and were on the whole inferior to his `straight' work. The
last chiefly comprised nudes, which combined strength and delicacy of a
high order and have a wonderful three-dimensional feeling. His minute
draughtmaship may have owed something to the Pre-Raphaelite influence,
though general his art was much more human and full blooded than that of
the `brethren'. Of his technical mastery then can be no manner of doubt.
The collection of his drawings may yet become a cult.
