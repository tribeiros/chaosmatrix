>Tzi...I, for one, would like to hear your thoughts on
>Spare-as-Tantrika"!!!   :-)
</XMP>
<P>

The most clear reflection of this is in some of his word choices... using
"kia" for eye (in Sanskrit, the word's "khya"), "ikkha" for will (in
Sanskrit, Iccha), etc.  These terms are used in Tantra quite frequently...
especially "khya", which is an unusual, almost fundamentally Tantric, use of
the word.<P>

Some of his workings also bring to mind Tantric works... such as having sex
with 18 prostitutes in a single night which, in turn, unleashed a great
burst of creativity.  This is very commensurate with Tantric practice in
general (using sexual energy to boost kundalini-shakti up the susumna), and
in fact it's very nearly impossible to have sex 18 times in a single night
if one ejaculates each, or even most, times (talk about <I>sore</I>, eh?
:)<P>

My suspicion, though it's never explicitly stated, is that he re-channeled
the stored semen (bija or rasa in Tantra) into a "higher energy"... in this
case, artistic creativity.  Again, quite in keeping with Tantric practice
generally.<P>

Spare's great attraction to ugly, even deformed, women in the course of his
work also reflects on Tantric involvement; in most forms of Tantra, one
unites specifically with things that disgust one in order to overcome the
limitations that such disgust imposes upon them.  This is especially
noteable amongst Tantric groups like the Ahoras and Kapilikas, who were
known for mutilating themselves and for dining on such delicacies as rotting
human corpses and feces.  In fact, this is a <I>major</I> element of the
practice
of such groups.<P>

Spare makes reference to Kia as "the supreme bliss" in his work...
considering that he was almost completely visually oriented, the eye was, to
him, exactly that.  And he does equate, in fact, Kia with the eye in his
famous formula of "uniting the hand (ikkha/iccha) with the eye (kia/khia)".
Look, especially, at "A Creed of Despair" in Spare's "Earth Inferno":<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"My ambition is DEAD,<BR>
Died premature and with it the love of care,<BR>
Also the Jewel in the Lotus.<BR>
The morrow holds nought <sic> for me<BR>
Save Sin and Death.<BR>
I am even exempt from my own created PLEASURES ---<BR>
The barrenness of this life but remains.<BR>
Yet in despair we begin to see true light.  AMEN.<BR>
In weakness we can become strong.<P>

Revere the Kiâ and Your Mind will become TRANQUIL."<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This piece could have been lifted DIRECTLY from any number of Tantric
doctrines.  Especially, note the peculiar way in which "kia" is spelled
here... in exactly the way that translators at the time (and to this day)
transliterate Sanskrit words, to indicate that the final "a" is
pronounced.<P>

And "the jewel in the lotus"... again, a Tantric (albeit Buddhist tantric)
formula, which means "Om".  The inlcusion of "om" in every mantra is not a
specifically Tantric theme; indeed, many Tantrics rebelled against it as
being part of the very Brahminic tradition which Tantric was formulated
<I>against</I>.  And, also, Tantra advises withdrawal from the perceived
obligations of this world and the eschewing of discursive thought revolving
around pain and pleasure.<P>

So, in reducing this formula, we get:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I give up my drive for worldly things,<BR>
Though young, I care no longer for obligations of this world,<BR>
And I rebuke religion and priests.<BR>
Tomorrow is nothing<BR>
And the desire for it is corruption.<BR>
I no longer have pleasures, nor pains.<BR>
My body is but a shell, empty of meaning.<BR>
By renunciation, I perceive my truth... my vision of god.<BR>
By weakening my body (Spare was certainly an ascetic!), I strengthen my
spirit.<P>

Revere sight for sight's sake, without discrimination (Kiâ is not a
discriminative function, and the eye is not a discriminative organ) and you
will have peace."<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

All of this is quite in keeping with Tantric thought and practice!<P>

Now, if you have Earth Inferno, take a look at the accompanying illustration
entitled "The Despair"....<P>

Note the strange position of the woman in black, her arms crossed behind her
back?  The woman stretched out upon the altar?  The little masked man
squatting next to her?  And note one more thing... Spare was a
<I>master</I>
draughtsman, and yet there appears to be an error in the positioning of the
figures... the woman in black's legs vanish through the floor or altar upon
which the sacrifice is stretched.<P>

The woman in black is a Tantric goddess... there is even, if you look
closely, a snake crawling up her chest from between her cleavage.  You can
just see it's head peeking above the top of her low-cut dress, just between
her breasts.  That snake is Kundalini, and identifies the woman with Shakti
herself.  Note, too, that she stands *to the left* of the figure that (I
think) is supposed to be Spare himself... that's <I>absolutely</I> typical
Tantric iconography.  Note, further, that the Woman in Black appears to need
a shave!!!!  And, oddly enough, so does the figure of Spare.  In other
words, they participate in one being... the woman is herself a part of Spare
in a way... being his <I>own</I> kundalini-shakti.  The use of <I>three</I>
candles is
significant in that one name y which this very goddess is known is
Tripura... literally "three cities", the three cities being the three gunas
(attributes) that, according to Tantric thought, make up all creation...
tamas (darkness/matter), rajas (fire/passion) and Sattva
(brilliants/divinity).<P>

The Tantric elements in just this one illustration (drawn in <I>1905</I>)
indicate strongly a Tantric connection... and considering Spare's magickal
tutor was an old woman (I think, perhaps, a Yogini herself, though she's
left no written record), I think that the Tantric element may have been the
origin of <I>much</I> of Spare's work, both magically and artistically.<P>

However, remember that secrecy is considered by most Tantric practitioners
to be the very essence of Tantra... he's not going to come out and
<I>tell</I>
you that he's based much of his work on Tantra.  However, I think Kenneth
Grant knows about this connection.  There are many other instances and
examples of this tie-in as well, and I've even been offered anecdotal
evidence in the past that Spare, in fact, actively studied Tantra at a later
point in his life.  But my fingers are getting tired...<P>
