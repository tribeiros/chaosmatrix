<H1>Aida</H1>

"Aida" by Austin Osman Spare is a rather large (30W x 20H) pastel
on board picture.  Executed in 1954 this piece represents an
excellent example of the artist's "automatic" drawing.<P>

The head and torso of an enigmatic woman of regal bearing and
wearing an egyptian headdress, (Ureas), dominates the center of
the composition.  She peers haughtily to her left, breasts bared
at the lower edge of the depiction, illuminated from below by a
dim, reddish light.  Aida's line of sightseems to be directed at
a weird facial image emerging from the chaotic field to her left
and front.  To her right background, unformed shapes swirl
mindlessly upward.<P>

Despite the seeming lack of of distinct focal points, this
artwork possesses a strong sense of depth, arising from the
forceful presentation of the queen, her position relative to the
formlessness to he right, and to the emergent visage to her left
front.  The unformed void area is distinctly <U>behind</U>; the
chaos field and face are distinctly <U>forward</U>.  The contrast
between the drisply drawn features of Aida and the wild vagueness
within which she is surrounded further accentuates the visual
depth of this work.<P>

Remember -- A.O. Spare was a gifted draughtsman, with formal
training including the Royal College of Art.  His technical
ability cannot be disputed.<P>

Inasmuch as artistic efforts may be
manifestations of True Will, visual artworks are magickal works.
A.O. Spare's skill as an artist has found some critical acceptance,
less so, his abilities as a sorceror.  Now, AOS's occult skills are
once again being understood, and with this understanding, his
magick is becoming re-known.  Spare's art has been characterized
as of magical inspiration, and in some cases of being intrinsically
magickal.  Not all works have a full measure of both -- intuition
strongly suggests that Aida <U>does</U>.<P>

When viewing the picture, the question:  "Who is she?" lurches to
the forefront.  AOS drew for himself, and as the agent of those
beings to whom he was receptive.  What then of Aida?  A temporal
door?  An invitation?  The opportunity to experience the Spareian
vision, or the vision of Aida...?<P>

By accout, AOS often relied upon middle aged men or older
prostitutes for his models, yet in Aida, he imbued his his subject
with beauty, power, and majesty:  This may be a woman who has
experienced the world, but in doing so clearly has not lost her
authority or her destiny.  She appears as the Empress, or perhaps
the High Priestess...?<P>

Wherein lies the source of her power?  To what end has this force
been imparted to her?  By what means?<P>

This drawing is a magical icon.  An entity evoked by the artist,
Aida has been made corporeal within the visual spectrum by Spare's
application of color upon the board.<P>

Art may be more powerful than words.  In his "Focus of Life", AOS
states: "Art is the truth we have realized of our belief."
Assuming that he was referring to his artwork, this seems to
validate the speculation offered by Jaques Rigaut/Genesis P.
Orridge in the essay "Virtual Mirrors in Soud T.I.M.E.":<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"All his writings are symbolic, they were never
intended to be taken literally... They are appendices to the REAL
work... His drawings, paintings, and images... <U>They</U> are in
fact, the essence of his sorcery."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Upon viewing "Aida", her characterization of visual formula becomes
reified -- Effecting some depths of mind, she becomes an access
point to "otherwhere".  Her moment, encompassing her existence,
manifests her creation and her destruction; her coming from and
going to, hence opens as a portal to her <U>All</U>.  This
drawing is Magick.  To again cite "Virtual Mirrors":<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Spare's pictures can hold the entirety of the images
and entities that he represents... They are there."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

What character the name "Aida" may have been assigned to is
irrelevant to experienceing this picture; as ntoed the woman
depicted is queenly, yet also priestess-like.  Whether she is an
Empress or the Hierophanta may be a subjective determination.
An exploration of her charms and wonders promises to be lengthy.<P>

What remains immediate and apparent, is that this picture has
magickal attributes, and that these energies are potent enough
that discussing them does not diminish them.  As in another quote:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Such drawings are themselves the gateway to the
Sabbath; one is drawn into a vortex and whirled down the funnel
of consciousness which explodes into unknown worlds."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

This then, is "Aida", who at the very least, leaves us with an
apprehension of A.O. Spare's Sorcery.<P>
