<H1>Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils</H1>
<H2>by Frater U:.D:.</H2>

<HR>

The end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century was a
time characterized by radical changes and great heretics. The secret lore
and the occult in general were triumphant, and there were good reasons for
this:  the triumph of materialist positivism with its Manchester
industrialism was beginning to show its first malice, resulting in social
and psychological uprooting; the destruction of nature had already begun
to bear its first poisonous fruits. In brief, it was a time when it seemed
appropriate to question the belief in technology and the omnipotence of
the celebrated natural sciences. Particularly intellectuals, artists, and
the so-called "Bohemians" became advocates of values critical of
civilization in general as can be seen in the literature of Naturalism, in
Expressionist Art and in the whole Decadent Movement, which was quite
notorious at the time. Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was a typical child
of this era and, after Aleister Crowley, he was definitely one of the most
interesting occultists and practicing magicians of the English-speaking
world. Nowadays he is basically known only in this cultural context; [1]
internationally, he has received only some attention in literary circles
at best-ironically, in a footnote! This footnote is found in Mario Praz's
pioneering but, unfortunately, rather superficial work La carne, la morte
e il diavolo nella letteratura romantica (The Romantic Agony, Florence,
1930) where he terms him, together with Aleister Crowley, a "satanic
occultist" [2]-and that is all. Nevertheless, this important work has at
least led many an occult researcher familiar with literature to Spare.
Compared with Aleister Crowley's enigmatic and infamous life, Austin Osman
Spare's existence certainly seemed to befit only a footnote. Despite his
various publications after the turn of the century, he remained
practically unnoticed until the late sixties. He was born in 1886, the son
of a London police officer, and we know very little about his childhood.
He claimed to have experienced while a child an initiation of sorts by an
elderly witch, one Mrs. Paterson who, as far as we know, must have been
quite a Wiccan-like character. Spare found his intellectual and creative
vocation as an artist and illustrator, and he attended the Royal College
of Art, where he soon was celebrated as a forthcoming young artist. But he
rebelled against a bourgeois middle-class career in the arts. Disgusted by
commercialism, he retreated from the artistic scene soon afterwords,
though he still continued editing various magazines for quite a while.
From 1927 until his death, he virtually lived as a weird hermit in a
London slum, where he sometimes held exhibitions in a local pub. People
have compared his life with that of H. P. Lovecraft, and certainly he too
was an explorer of the dark levels of the soul. Around the beginning of
the First World War, he released some privately published editions, and
today one can acquire-at least in Great Britain-numerous, usually highly
expensive, reprints of his works. However, we are primarily interested in
two volumes, namely his well-known Book of Pleasure (Self-Love): The
Psychology of Ecstasy (London, 1913) [3] and Kenneth Grant's excellently
researched book [4] in which he, as leader of his own brand of O.T.O.
(Ordo Templi Orientis) and as an expert on Crowley, deals with the
practical aspects of Spare's system as well. Spare's actual philosophy
will not be analyzed in depth here because this is not really necessary
for the practice of sigil theory and it would lead away form the subject
of this study. Before we begin with Spare's theory of sigils, it is
perhaps useful to write a few words about the part sigils play in a
magical working. Occidental magic is known to rest on two main pillars,
namely on will and on imagination.  Connected with these are analogous
thinking and sybolic images. For example, Agrippa uses a special sigil for
each of the planetary intelligences. These are not, as has been assumed
for quite some time, arbitrarily constructed, nor were they received by
"revelation," but rather they are based on cabbalistic consideration. [5]
The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn also employed sigils as "images of
the souls" of magical entities, which enabled the magician to establish
contact with them; nevertheless, the technique of their construction was
not explained. The same may be said for the O.T.O. under Crowley's
leadership and for the Fraternitas Saturni under Gregorius. The name
Agrippa already hints at the fact that magical sigils have a long
historical tradition, which we will not discuss here because then we would
have to cover the whole complex of occult iconology as well. In general,
people think of "correct" and "incorrect" sigils. The grimoires of the
late Middle Ages were often little else but "magical recipe books" (the
frequently criticized Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses basically applies
the same procedure of "select ingredients, pour in and stir"), and these
practitioners believed in the following principle: to know the "true" name
and the "true" sigil of a demon means to have power over it. Pragmatic
Magic, which developed in the Anglo- Saxon realms, completely tidied up
this concept. [6] Often Crowley's revolt in the Golden Dawn-at first in
favor of but soon against Mathers-is seen as the actual beginning of
modern magic. It would certainly not be wrong to say that Crowley himself
was an important supporter of Pragmatic thought in modern magic. But in
the end, the Master Therion preferred to remain within the hierarchical
Dogmatic system due to his Aiwass-revelation in Liber Al vel Legis. His
key phrase "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the
law, love under will," as well as his whole Thelemic concept, prove him a
Dogmatic magician. Not so Austin Osman Spare. He seems to derive from the
individual-anarchistic direction so that we may describe his philosophy,
without undue exaggeration, as a mixture of Lao-Tse, Wicca and Max
Stirner.  English magic of the turn of the century was also influenced by
an important young science which would actually achieve its major triumphs
only after the Second World War-the psychology of Sigmund Freud. Before
that, Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine, as well as
Frazer's The Golden Bough, had given important impulses to the occult in
general. William James's comparitive psychology of religion influenced
deeply the intellectuality of this time, but Freud, Adler, and especially
Carl G. Jung eventually effected major breakthroughs. From then on, people
started to consider the unconscious in earnest. This apparent digression,
which had to be kept very short due to lack of space, is in reality a very
important basis for the discussion that follows. We will not analyze in
depth by whom Spare was influenced. Lao-Tse and Stirner having already
been mentioned, we might note numerous others from Swinburne to Crowley
himself, in whose order, the A:.A:., Spare had been a member at least for
a short while. Rather, we will discuss his greatest achievement-his
psychological approach towards magic. This leads us to magical practice
proper. In Spare's system there are no "correct" or "incorrect"  sigils;
neither is there a list of ready-made symbols. It is of no import whether
a sigil is the "correct" one or not, but it is crucial that it has been
created by the magician and is therefore meaningful to him/her. Because
s/he has constructed it for personal use, the sigil easily becomes a
catalyst of his/her magical desire, and sometimes it will even waken this
desire in the first place. This Pragmatic approach which dominates
present-day Anglo-Saxon magic (Israel Regardie, Francis King, Stephen
Skinner, W. B. Gray, David Conway, Lemuel Johnstone, to name but a few
relevant authors) goes to show that Austin Osman Spare, rather than
Aleister Crowley, should be considered the real Father of modern Pragmatic
Magic. [7] In the German-speaking countries, the situation is quite
different. Writers like Quintscher, Gregorius, Bardon, Klingsor and even
Spiesberger allow but little room to maneuver when creating magical
coordinates individually. Here the adept is expected to grow into a
ready-made system instead of fashioning one. This is a completely
different approach, the value or non-value of which we will not discuss
here. The nearest thing to Pragmatic Magic, existing already in 1917 i.e.
1921 (the date of the second revised edition of his major work on magic as
an experimental science), was Staudenmaier. The works by Mahamudra, which
have of late been receiving some attention, are mainly of a descriptive
nature and deal with traditions and new interpretations, thus remaining
within the context of German magical heritage; however, they do take heed
of recent results in scientific psychology and are, therefore, at least
partially related to the Pragmatic approach. Pragmatic Magic will become
more and more important because today's magicians have to face a
psychologized-and psychologizing-environment whose philosophical
relativism has been shaping all of us, and still does. Regardless of the
significance or amount of truth one concedes to psychology/psychoanalysis,
we all are infiltrated by its way of thinking and its vocabulary. So even
we magicians will have to attain to a critical, sensible look at it. It
will be left to another era to find different models of explanation,
description and practice. How does Spare proceed in practice? Sigils are
developed by fusion and stylization of letters (see Figure 1). First of
all, a sentence of desire has to be formulated. Let us take the example
Spare himself gives in his Book of Pleasure, the declaration of intent: <P>

THIS   MY   WISH   TO   OBTAIN   THE   STRENGTH   OF   A   TIGER    <P>

>>>>> This sentence must be written down in capitals. Next, all the
letters which appear more than once are deleted so that only one of each
letter remains. [Ed. Note: The asterisks denote crossed out letters. Also
beginning the declaration of intent with THIS MY WILL instead of THIS MY
WISH may prove more efficacious.]<P>

THIS   MY   W***    *O    *B*A*N   **E     **R**G**     *F    *    *****<P>

Thus, the following letters remain: T,H,I,S,M,Y,W,O,B,A,N,E,R,G,F. The
sigil is created from these letters; it is permissible to consider one
part (for example, M) as a reversed W or, seen from the side, as an E.
Hence, these three letters do not have to appear in the sigil three
separate times. Of course, there are numerous possibilities of
representation and stylization. <P>

[Ed. Note: There was once a crude attempt at an ASCII sigil here, but it
got screwed up beyond all recognition. I am trying to find the original
sigil and will do another ASCII version when I find it.  --Fenwick]
</BLOCKQUOTE></I><P>

"This my wish to obtain the strength of a tiger."<P>

Sigilized this would be:   <P>

This my wish ---&gt;<BR>
To obtain ---&gt;<BR>
The strength<BR>
of a tiger ---&gt;<BR>
Combined as<BR>
one sigil ---&gt;<BR>

<HR>

<P>
However, it is important that in the end the sigil is as simple as
possible with the various letters recognizable (even with slight
difficulty). The artistic quality of the sigil is irrelevant, but for
simple psychological reasons it should be obvious that you should not just
scribble or doodle in haste. You should strive to make it to the best of
your abilities. The finished sigil, which in the beginning will probably
take a few attempts to construe, with then be fixated. You may draw it on
parchment, on paper, in the sand, or even on a wall. According to Spare's
short instructions, it should be destroyed after its internalization.
Thus, you will either burn the parchment, wipe it out in the sand, etc.
Spare's basic idea is that the sigil, together with its meaning, must be
planted into the unconscious. Afterwards, the consciousness has to forget
it so that the unconscious can obey its encoded direction without
hindrance. When the sigil is ready, it is activated by implanting it into
the psyche. This is the most difficult part in this process, and Spare
offers only very few hints on practical procedures.  However, it is
crucial that the sigil is internalized in a trance of sorts.  This may
take place in a state of euphoria (for example, by means of drugs), in
ecstasy (for example, sex magically by masturbation, sexual intercourse or
a ritual), or in a state of physical fatigue. For the latter example, eyes
and arms may be tired by the magician folding his/her arms behind the head
while standing in front of a mirror and staring fixedly at his/her image.
The important thing is that it should click, meaning that the sigil must
be internalized spasmodically, which, of course, requires some exercise
and control. This procedure may be supported by repeating the sentence of
desire rhythmically and monotonously like a mantra, becoming faster and
faster; in doing so, one must stare fixedly at the sigil. (In our example
of looking into the mirror [a magical mirror may be used, too], it is
useful to draw the sigil onto the mirror with water-soluble paint.) After
spasmodical internalization, the symbol must be destroyed and deleted from
the conscious mind. As mentioned before, from now on it will be the
unconscious which has to do the work. In my own practical work I have
discovered that it may even be useful to keep the sigil on you, such as
wearing a ring engraved with it, etc. But this will depend upon the
magician's individual predilection, and everybody should find his/her own
way. Occasionally, it may prove necessary to repeat the whole procedure,
especially if the goal is a very problematical one, requiring an
outstanding amount of energy. Nevertheless, experience shows that it is of
prime importance not to bring back the meaning and aim of the sigil into
consciousness at any time. We are, after all, dealing with a technique
akin to autosuggestion; thus, the rules are the same as with
autosuggestions themselves. Therefore, you may not use negative formulas
such as "THIS MY WISH NOT TO ..." because very often the unconscious tends
neither to recognize nor understand this "not," and you might end up
getting the opposite result than that which you originally desired. If you
see a sigil every day, perhaps on a wall or engraved on the outer side of
a ring, this should only take place unconsciously, just as one might not
consciously notice an object which is in use all the time. Of course, you
should keep your operation secret, for discussing it with skeptics or even
good friends may dissolve the sigil's power. The advantages of this
method, of which only a short summary can be given here, are obvious. It
is temptingly easy, and with only a little practice it may be performed at
any time and at any place. It does not call for any costly paraphernalia;
protective Circles and Pentagram rituals are not required (though
sometimes they may prove useful, especially with operations of magical
protection), etc. People who tend to psychic instability should, however,
be cautious. Although the threshold to schizophrenia is not as easily
crossed with this method as with common evocations, it does involve
cutting deeply into the ecology of the psyche, an act which should be
considered carefully in any case. The psycho-magical consequences are
sometimes quite incalculable. As is well known, the real problem with
magic is not so much the question whether it works, but rather the fact
that it does. Used with responsibility, this method offers the magician a
tool which provides him/her with a limitless variety of possible magical
applications.<P>
