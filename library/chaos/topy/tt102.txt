1)  This is thee last 23rd ov this winter and though thee winter was mild
here in Seattle E have still managed to obtain a cold...so E already
look forward to thee spring...thee next 23rd is not thee equinox but it
follows shortly there after...so for our next sigil we might want to keep
that in mind...to bring a renewed life to our"selves" and to whatever 
we have set our wills, through functional ritual... 

Thee piece titled "Winter Greetings" E recieved early this winter by 
a Coyote from Denver who did not sign thee piece with his number so it
is not here included which  E would like to rename "Winter Farewells"...    
and thee piece by Kali 100 is  reprinted as found in thee Oct Cct 
ov 1990...thee Gysin piece is from "The Third Mind", a book written by 
Gysin and Burroughs on thee cut-up method...

			WINTER GREETINGS

		She lay stonily indifferent,as if in a trance.
		belly stone never cool,
		hyenas near the lake
		revealed a grim face
		laced with their tracks.
		   reverted,
		   brooding vultures,
		room glistened with
		He scissored open
		a dead embryo.
		seen in photographs,
		the dark trail

3)  Thee Void

	Many people feel an abscence in their life.  Why?  It seems that
it could be that we do not know ourSelves.  We feel a constant DEEP VOID
in our hearts, and do not know how to go about filling it.  We may
substitute things or people to fill it, but it is still All-Ways there!  
Couldn't it be possible that we have forgotten who we Real-ly are?  Is
that what that Void is?  Our own Self?
	Thee following is a list ov questions we can ask ourSelves. 
This is not a test, and ther are no correct answers.  Only YOU hold 
thee answers.  Do with them what you Will.  You know in your heart what
is ultimately Right and Wrong, and YOU know when you are lying to your SELF.

Do E REALLY know my Self?

Do E L-ov-e my Self?  Why or why not?

Am E honest with my Self?  Why or why not?

Am E afraid to touch my Self?  Why or why not?

Do E fear anything or anyone?  Why or why not?
What is it about this that E fear it?
Do E WANT o feel fear?

Am E insecure?  Why or why not?

Do E WANT to change?
Am E willing to change?
Am E afraid to change?  Why or why not?
What is it about my Self tha E want to change?
Do E believe that E can ever get to thee point when E don't need to 
	progress any more?  Why or why not?

Do E have any habits E know are bad for ME?

What do E want to do with my life?

What ULTIMATE goals do E have?
Are they my goals or someone elses?  Why?
Is thee goal possible?  If not, why?

How can E accomplish what E will?

Would E let others suffer for my own selfish porposes?  Why not or why?

Is my goal something that is physical or mental?  Why?

Will material things REALLY give me TRUE happiness?
Am E materialistic?  Why or why not?
AM E predjudice?  Why or why not?Am E judgemental?  Why or why not?

Am E being honest with my Self?

Is it Really possible that a physical thing can be a substitue for
	thee Void in my life?
What is that Void in my life?
Why is it there?
Why do E feel there is a Void?

Do E concentrate too much on one thing?
	Certain person?
	Certain kinds ov people?
	Certain faiths, belifs, morals?
	Certain kinds ov music?
Isn't it true that if E concentrate only upon one side ov thee street,
	I'm missing what may-Be on thee other side?

Am E a Talker, Listtener, or Observer?  Why?
Which would E rather be?  Why?
Can't E be all Three?  Why or why not?

Do E "hate" anyBody or anyThing?  Why or why not?

What does thee word "Peace" ultimatly mean to ME?

What does thee word "L-OV-E" ultimatly mean to ME?

Do E want to be a better person?  Why not or why?

If E want to be a beter person,   HOW do E go about DO-ing this?

When should E star?

Why not NOW?  At This moment?

4)  Minutes to Go

the hallucinated have come to tell you that yr utilities
are being shut off   dreams monitored   though directed
sex is shutting down everywhere   you are being sent

all word are taped   agents everywhere
marking down the live ones   to exterminate

they are turning out the lights

no   they are not evil   nor the devil   but men
on a mission   with a spot of work to do

this   dear friends   they intend to do on you

you have been offered a choice   between liberty and 
freedom    and    No!   you cannot have both

the next step   is everyone into space   but it has been
a long dull wait   since the last tower of babel
that first derisive visit of the   paraclete

let's not hear that noise again  and again

that may well be   the last word anywhere

this is not the beginning   in the geginning was the word
the word has been in for a too   long time
you in the word and   the word in you

we are out 
you are in 

we have come to let you out

here and now we will show you   what you can do
with and to
the word
the words
any word
all the words

Pick a book   any book   cut it up
cut up
prose
poems
newspapers
magazines
the bible
the koran
the book of moroni
la-tzu
confucius
the bhagavad gita
anything
letters
business correspondence
ads
all the words

slice down the middle   dice into sections
according to taste
chop in some bible   pour on some Madison Avenue
prose
shuffle cards   toss like confette
taste it like piping hot   alphabet soup

pass yr friends' letters   yr office carbons
through any such sieve   as you may find or invent

you will soon see   just what they really are
saying   this is the terminal method for
finding the truth

piece together a masterpiece   a week
use better materials   more highly charged words

there is no longer a need   to drum up a season of
geniuses   be your own agent   until we deliver
the machine   in commercially reasonable quantities

we wish to announce   that while we esteem
this to be truly   the American Way
we have no commitments   with any government
groups

the writing machine   is for everybody
do it yourself   until the machine comes
here is the system   according to us

5)  Temple Text II

It woould be an illusion to think tha the Individual can hide all the
clues to his Oneness.  His task is therefore to see to it that all the
clues are wronly interpreted.  Thus it is tha tthey may SEEM to indicate
a lack of individuality and crate a felling of disapppointment rather
than curiosity.  this tactic gives us space and protection in the traps
of time. 

An Individual has many personalities or characters at the sme time or 
alternately.  (Recent cognitive brain theory supports this.)  Most
people litttle by little eliminate the personalities considered to be 
dangerous by their peer group or societal unit and fianlly keep only one: 
the social personality...one dimensional "FLAT" people.  But other people, 
called paradoxically "Individuals", are always trying to develop all
their personalities, even if ther is an internal conflict between them. 
So we can clearly see that the Individualist personlogically must use
"WE" to name himself, whilst the person who belongs to the masses must
use the "I".  The first is multi-dimensional, the second is uni-dimensional.

One on the Temple functions is to encourage and support the development
of multidimensional Indiviual.  Hence our use of "WE" in our texts.

Our enemies are Flat.
