1)  E hope everyone had a JOY-full Solstice....there were some 
questions asked during this last lunar phase which E will try to 
address NOW... 

>I noticed the strange spelling, for example 'of' was spelled as 'ov' 
>and 'psychic' was spelled as 'psychick' was that spelling intentional? 
>Does it reflect something about the viewpoint or opinion or philosophy 
>of the TOPY?  

We Feel that language should be reclaimed by thee Individual... 
language controls not only what we say but what and how We think by our
manipulation ov language...whether by thee cutup method, or our own
creative use ov capitalization ov letters, phonetics and hyphens... 
what is really meant is revelaed...an example, be-LIE-f...another
example is B-Earth...this "new" word now has a double meaning "Earth"
and "birth" to be used either or both ways simultaneously..."OV
designates thee sperm (or any orgasmic sexual fluid) in thee terminology
ov thee TEMPLE" thee "K" ov psychick has thee same function as thee "K"
ov MAGICK (please see MAGICK IN THEORY AND PRACTICE by A. C.) which is
to designate it from ordinary magic...thee use of E has many meanings...
I, he, she, we, me, and Everyone or Everybody...We is used when speaking
for thee Tribe....here is an Excerpt from "Liber III vel Jugorum":

"1. Here are practices. Each may last for a week, or more.

	(a) Avoid using some common word, such as "and" or "the" or "but"; 
	use a paraphrase.
	(b) Avoid using some letter of the alphabet, such as "t" or "s" or "m";
	use a paraphrase.
	(c) Avoid using the pronouns and adjectives of the first person; use a 
        paraphrase.
	Of thine own ingenium devise others.

2. On each occasion that thou art betrayed into saying that thou art sworn to 
avoid, cut thyself sharply upon the wrist or forearm with a razor; even as thou
shouldst beat a disobedient dog. Feareth not the Unicorn the claws and teeth of
the Lion?

3. Thine arm then serveth thee both for a warning and for a record. Thou shalt 
write down they daily progress in these practices, until thou art perfectly 
vigilant at all times over the least word that slippeth from thy tongue.
   Thus bind thyself, and thou shalt be forever free."

TOPY does n0t have a strict code for terminology or anything else 
experimentation is thee Focus...reclaim language from thee agents ov 
control...

>Where is the Temple located?

"Thee TEMPLE is where a boxer punches for a KO."
        -G P-O

>What type of organization is it? For profit? Or non-profit? 

TOPY  is a non-for-profit organization...thee PTV World Domination Club
is n0t...

>Is it a new organization? If not, how old? 

TOPY  is 10 y-Eras old.

>How large is it? About how many members? What is the average age of members? 

TOPY is an international organization with Access Points in England,
Europe and North America...E am not sure as to thee number ov active 
members or allies...there are memebers 4 y-Eras old and 80 y-Eras young...

>What structure does it have? 

As little as possible...

>What does it do? 

TOPY is a network for thee dispersion ov Information to those who dare
to touch themselves and desire to touch others in a very special way...
 
>Are there any requirments or limits on membership? 

To be an ally, no...to be an active member, yes...to participate in a
RATIO ONE Sigilization Ritual...if you are interested, write an Access Point

>Is there a membership fee? 

N0

>IS there a common viewpoint or philosophy? 

This is a tough question...yes there are common view points and
philosopies shared by thee Active TOPI E have met, talked with or 
corresponded with...but even with those with whom E have shared the same
view on one topic they may have disagreed on another...even upon the
purpose, meaning, and worth to rituals we have shared in...but that is
to be expected in an anarchistic group of individuals who share as a
common purpose...self-Exploration...

>Are there TOPY centers in NEW YORK or FLORIDA?

N0 Access Points as to my knowledge but there might be a COYOTE PACT
about...try fliering or putting an ad in thee personals ov an appropiate 
'zine it has worked before...

3)  CHAOS by Hakim Bey

Chapter 2:  POETIC TERRORISM

Weird dancing in allnight computer banking olbbies.  Unauthorized
pyrotechnic displays.  Land-art, earth-works as bizarre alien 
artifacts strewn in State Parks.  Burglarize houses but instead of
stealing, leave Poetic-Terrorist objects.  Kidnap someone & make 
them happy.

Pick someone at random & convince them they're the heir to an
enourmous, useless & amazing fortune -say 5000 sq. miles of 
Antarctica, or an aging circus elephant, or an orphanage in Bombay, 
or a collection of alchemical mss.  Later they will come to realize 
that for a few moments they believe in something extaordinary, 
& will perhaps be driven as a result to seek out some more intense 
mode of existence.

Bolt up brass commemorative plaques in places (public or private) 
where you have experienced a revelation or had a particularly 
fulfilling sexual experience, etc.

Go naked for a sign.

Organize a strike in your school or workplace on the grounds that 
it does not satisfy your need for indolence & spiritual beauty.

Grafitti-art loaned some grace to ugly subways & rigid public 
momuments -PT-art can also be created for public places:  poems 
scrawled in courthouse lavatories, small fetishes abandoned in 
parks & restaurants, xerox-art under windshield-wipers of parked 
cars, Big Character Slogans pasted on playground walls, anonymous 
letters mailed to random or chosen recipients (mailfraud), pirate 
radio transmissions, wet cement...

The audience reaction or aesthetic-shock produced by PT ought to 
be at least as strong as the emotion of terror -powerful disgust, 
sexual arousal, superstituous awe, sudden intuitive breakthrough, 
dada-esque angst -no matter whether the PT is aimed at one person 
or many, no matter whether it is "signed" or anonymous, if it does 
not change someone's life (aside from the artist) it fails.

PT is an act in a Theater of Cruelty which has no stage, no rows 
of seats, no tickets & no walls.  In order to work at all PT must
categorically be divorced from all conventional structures for art
consumption (galleries, publications, media).  Even the guerilla
Situationist tactics of street theater are perhaps too well-known
& expected now.

An exquisite seduction carried out not only in the cause of mutual 
satisfaction but also as a conscious act in a deliberately beatiful 
life -may be the ultimate PT.  The PTerrorist behaves like a 
confidence-trickster whose aim is not money but CHANGE.

Don't do PT for other artists, do it for people who will not realize 
(at least for a few moments) that what you have done is art.  Avoid
recognizable art-categories, avoid plitics, don't stick around to 
argue, don't be sentimental; be ruthless, take risks, vandalize only
what MUST be defaced, do something children will remember all their
lives -but don't be spontaneous unless the PT Muse has possessed you.
 
Dress up.  Leave a false name.  Be legendary.  The best PT is against
the law, but don't get caught.  Art as crime; crime as art.

4)  "Proof on Survival" by Victor Neuburg

Proof on survival
caused laughter in many minds
Experimented myself
Tried when
on other side
Do not be deterred by little results
Persevere
Worthwhile
Proved truth.


This thee exact text received in seance by a relative ov Victor Neuburg.
Neuburg was a close associate ov A. C., a prolific writer and a bold 
explorer ov thee possibilities ov sexual magick and visionary self-
discipline.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5)  Excerpt from thee CORRECT SADIST by T. Sellers
 
"Gradually the Church whose rituals I had ardently observed and whose
saints I emulated came to disappoint me.  I began to know the back of
the nun's hand as my waxing bad faith sloughed off the restraint of
fear.  This displeasure made me cynical as I dispiritedly marked in them
a strange repressed rage that focused too avidly upon the plest disobedience."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6)  666 (1999...thee Satanic Century 666 y-Era 0NE)

Vale- "What does 666 mean to you?"

Genesis P-Orridge-  "Actually, we've done some research into that with
Z'ev, who's much better at cabalistic and numerological matters than I
am.  He broke down the Mark of the Beast cabalistically; he took 666 
and discovered it means SOMA or somatic:  the body, but also the 
magic mushrooms which were psychedelic; the mark identifying which
mushrooms a shaman could use for further progression.  In other words,
it's KNOWLEDGE again, like the apple in the Garden of Eden.  Which makes
a lot more sense to me..."

What does 666 mean to YOU?

"Right answers" to thee "wrong question":

>From NUIT 56:

666 to me is like this beautiful flower, ya know man?  It's like all
that beauty in the hole world tied up into one big beautiful not.  It's
like a rainbow in the ocean and a little slug squirming to safety from
the salt.  666 is where it's at.

                           \ /
                           O O
                          \___/  
                           ` `

- - -

And the CrayDeath responds:

} Just came up with this, so I have yet to grok the full implications.
} For some reason, I decided to treat 666 as an octal number.  Then I
} just converted the thing to decimal; 666 OCT = 438 DEC.  This didn't
} have much meaning until I considered the individual digits and tried
} to sound out a word from them; FOURTHREEEIGHT -> FOuRTHReeeIGHT ->
} FORTHRIGHT.  Proof that to be forthright is to be evil.

Quabalistic implications ov DREAMACHINE by A. M. McKenzie

"Thee DREAMACHINE is constructed from Islamic principles, and the form
ov Quabalixm used with respect these constructions is essentially Judaic
in nature, but as Bysin also knew, thee roots ov this ancient Art stem
from precisely the same root:  the realisation that sound encapsulated
in thee Word, written or spoken, is capable ov dissection in order to 
ascertain the correspondences and ramifications ov the inner meaning/s 
presented by a material manifestation, on all levels. 

Written as one word, as Gysin always referred to it, 

"DREAMACHINE"

nun-ayin-shin-mem-aleph-resh-daleth <n-aa-sh-m-a-r-d>
(read right to left)
50 + 70 + 300 + 40 + 1 + 200 + 4 = 665

          plus thee Dreamer (1)  = 666 

-thee number ov "Thee Beast"...which must be "ridden" to thee 
unknowable and sacred realms."

- - -

0ne ov me favorites is the refernce to 6 as thee number ov woman...thus
"thee Beast" is feminine sexual energy, ie. Sakti or OV...another is
that 2 is the number ov humanity, male and female and 3 is thee number
of thee divine trinity...so 2 x 3 = 6 thus, "thee Beast" are those who
dare to touch their own divinity...despite god's warning to stay clear
ov thee "Tree ov Knowledge"
