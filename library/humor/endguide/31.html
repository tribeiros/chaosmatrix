<title>Reality Check</title>

<body>
<p>I followed the directions as exactly as I could. My poor little scooter
barely made it across the battlefield. I just let it fall over when I
arrived, not even bothering to use the kickstand, because soon I might have
a fabulous new car, or more. I approached Leon's House of Gifts. A hooded
camera mounted on a sinuous flexible tube emerged from the alfalfa, gazing
ominously at me. I showed it the barcode They had tattooed on my palm. It
nodded, and the door opened.
</p>

<p>The place looked empty despite the numerous empty cardboard boxes
cluttering the floor. I approached the register, trembling. Leon smiled. I
handed him the check, staring at the credit card reader to avoid having to
look into his eyes. Was that blood? No, it's gone. Leon asked me if I was
sure I wanted this, told me that it was a pretty drastic decision and that
he gave out no refunds. Then he giggled disturbingly.
</p>

<p>I told him to cash the reality check. I was going, and there were no two
ways about it.
</p>

<p>When I emerged, my scooter was still there, the battlefield was still
there, but when I turned around Leon's place was gone. I heard laughter in
the distance. I righted my scooter and examined it. Superficially, it looked
pretty much the same, but I had been maintaining that thing for years, and
I recognized some parts that hadn't been there before. And the tank was
full. I felt cheated about the scooter, but on the whole, things were
looking up. I headed towards the laughter I had heard.
