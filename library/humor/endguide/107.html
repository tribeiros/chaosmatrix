<body>
<p>I know the vampires are out there. I am prepared for them. I have divided
my cells into armies, and they will protect me.
</p>

<p>I have placed cameras in my blood cells, so that when I am taken, there
will be a record of the places where the vampires live; let those who come
after me follow them to their lairs and destroy them utterly.
</p>

<p>I have placed viruses in my blood cells, so that when I am taken, a great
calamity will befall those who share in the feast; let those who come after
me cover their noses and mouths to keep out the death.
</p>

<p>I have placed forgetfulness in my blood cells, so that when I am taken,
they will know not what they are, and be stricken by the dawn, not knowing
to take shelter; let those who come after me walk in the dust of the
vampires' bodies.
</p>

<p>I have placed sin in my blood cells, so that when I am taken, they will
fall to wickedness, that is, a more general wickedness than the whole
blood-sucking thing; let those who come after me burn their houses of
unrepentant naughtiness.
</p>

<p>All these things have I done. I go now into the mouth of Hell. May God in
heaven and all the saints protect me.
