<title>Transformation (110)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>My clothes are in the dryer, and I am fading fast. I may not make it
through the night. I shall set down my last will and testament on this pair
of filthy underwear, coated with the sticky debris that is not mine. Alas,
my ink will not hold; it soils me with its runny darkness.
</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the rhythmic vomiting fits relax their hold on me, I dream
of the time when my body was just a body. It is fleeting, however; the
invaders within do not like it when I have thoughts, however innocuous. At
those times I can feel them fighting for control, and I can see talking
leopards menacing my periphery. Soon they regain control, and I must return
to the ceramic palace.
</p>

<p>What they are making of me, I do not know. They fill me with the urge to
eat many strange things, which I am ashamed to describe. My old teeth would
have worn down, but the new teeth they have made are strong. I can feel
them moving in my mouth sometimes.
</p>

<p>I am fortunate, I guess, that they have at least found something within me
that they can still use, even if it means undergoing this painful
transformation. Otherwise, I would no longer exist.
</p>

<p>I am finding it difficult to move, now. They have made thousands of tiny
tendrils, and I feel that they are now ready to bind me to the earth, to
begin searching for something. Minerals, perhaps. Goodbye.
