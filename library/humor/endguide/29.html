<title>Encounter at the Odious (29)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>They were closing the Odious Theater at the end of the month, so I went
with a couple of friends to see "The Ants" last night. The place was a
little bit dingier than I remembered it. The Helium Boy was there,
squawking during the intermission and selling frosted nightmares and dread
on a stick. I had an angora gel, myself.
</p>

<p>When the film broke, nobody in the audience realized something was up. But
I had seen the blokes hauling canisters up onto the roof. I thought it was
odd at the time, but I was determined to enjoy myself. Anyway, the lights
flickered and I suddenly smelled wet fur. I leaped to my feet just in time
to see the hamsters rappelling down the walls. I figured it was time to get
out of there.
</p>

<p>I haven't seen my friends since then. Either the hamsters got them, or
after the way I sort of abandoned them there, they decided they didn't
really like me all that much. But that's okay, because now I've got the
case of a lifetime. When I returned to my car, there was a woman waiting
there. She had scary eyes, the kind that you just know can see right into
your childhood, and she was fingering her beads of hope, and she asked me,
"Do *you* ever knuckle under to the demonic hell-spawn?" And I said, "Hell,
no, I'm Sissy-boy Johnson. I'm a private investigator. Where'd I be if I
did that?" And she let me in on a little secret, and gave me a picture of
the guy I have to find. And a lot is riding on this, so it really doesn't
matter that I'm out the three bucks for the ticket and didn't get to see
the whole movie. I'm gonna get to find out how it ends anyway.
