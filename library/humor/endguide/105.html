<p>I stop the car and get out, tense, alert, trembling like a filet mignon in
heat. The other car just sits there. The engine is silent, and I think to
myself that it just isn't right. I can't see the other driver. I can't see
anything in his car but my own reflection on the windshield. He doesn't
want to be seen.
</p>

<p>An artificial voice whispers in my ear, "Drop the bag and leave this
place. There will be no payment." I find I must obey, even though I know
this means my life will be over shortly. The bag falls from my hand, and I
hear the soft thud of my life's work hitting the pavement. In that one
instant, I am ruined. I return to my car.
</p>

<p>I am driving, now, but only the lines on the highway giving me a direction.
My life cannot go forward and it cannot go back. I can only drive. The
windshield protects me, for I am so empty inside I would surely be turned
to dust by the wind.
</p>

<p>Days have passed, or maybe only hours. I have left the urbs and suburbs
where I had invested my life in the contents of that bag. I am in a new
place on a dirt road. Perhaps it is a farm; I have heard of such things.
</p>

<p>The car has stopped functioning. I continue on the road, mindlessly,
crawling with the last of my strength. The stones and dirt are slowly
eating my clothes. I press on.
