<title>Hints from Hell (71)</title>

<body>
<p>Prevent ugly tartar sauce buildup by dousing your fish once in a while. I
find that a polite solution of beggar's juice and essence of toad works
wonders. Don't forget to plug up the major inlets while doing this, lest ye
leak.
</p>

<p>Another technique I find helpful is taping my knees to a blimp and saddling
up the old chestnut mare, if you know what I mean. A good yank on the
patella by a hefty dirigible works wonders. This, of course, does not
alleviate the stains and spots, but you should be getting out more if
that's a big concern of yours.
</p>

<p>Saving the shavings is also popular, especially among the environmentalists
in the audience. If you have excess shavings, you should not be shaving so
much - hey, simple problems require simple solutions.
</p>

<p>For problems with bestial witnessing in the yard, I look to the words of
wisdom of Henry Kissinger: "Just spread some lime on it and it will take
care of itself." This applies equally to boils, of course.
</p>

<p>In closing, I would like to summarize by rolling up everything I said
previously into a ball and turning it into a candlestick, while dancing a
jig to the national anthem, but I regret that I am unable to do this due to
my uncertainty regarding proper jig etiquette. My thanks go to the Academy,
and to all the little people, particularly the ones under my driveway.
