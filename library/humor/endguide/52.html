<p>I saw somebody parked in my space, so I went over to the Feverish Dreams
outlet at the end of the strip and told the guy with the big tongue that I
wanted to rent one of the Big Red Clone Warriors for the weekend. I had to
show him some leg to get only one, because the adults usually come in sets
of at least three. I named him Throbbo. We were going to have a great time.
</p>

<p>After we dismantled the car that was in my space, the police showed up. I
quickly briefed Throbbo on the finer points of surrender and toddled off to
get the ribbons belted on my wax idol. The sailor running the place was in
a merry mood, so I decided to have my phlegm levelled off too. I gave him a
set of matching peas as a tip, and asked him where I could go to put my wax
idol to good use, if you know what I mean.
</p>

<p>The place he directed me to was dark and grim, but there were many
unbelievable hirsute waitresses not so much serving drinks as pitching
them. I stood on a table, presented my wax idol, and loudly proclaimed my
divinity. A couple of the wobblier patrons cheered me on, and after a brief
brainwashing session, they were my willing slaves. I moved on to further
conquests.
</p>

<p>Eventually, I tired of the life of an omnipotent God-Emperor, and killed
all my subjects, leaving the earth to be repopulated by ants. But that's
another story.
