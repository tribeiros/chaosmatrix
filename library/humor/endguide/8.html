<p>Here is set down the revelation of Frank:
</p>

<p>I saw six eagles with six season passes. And Lo! the six eagles did grow
six new heads, and the heads spake, saying unto me that my fly was open.
And I looked, and out of my fly came six naked mole rats. And the naked
mole rats did squirm and cast aspersions, yet the eagles were not afraid.
Then a voice came out of Heaven, saying, "Where are my keys?" And there
appeared to me keys upon the waters. The first eagle took the first key,
and flew out of sight into Heaven, and the second eagle did likewise with
the second key, and so on, unto the fifth eagle and the fifth key; but the
sixth eagle rebelled, saying, "Get your own damn keys." And the sixth key
vanished, and the sixth eagle was smitten by a great host of peas, raining
down from on high.
</p>

<p>And the peas moved on the face of the burbling waters, and they gave forth
a non-nutritive sweetener, and the naked mole rats saw that it was good.
Whereupon a chorus of angels came to me and bade me sign release forms, and
also they bade me surrender the film rights, which I did. And suddenly I
was raised up, and given to enter the gates of Heaven without standing in
the holy lines, which were like unto those at amusement parks. And I
particularly liked the holy water flume ride at the end.
