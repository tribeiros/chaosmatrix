<title>Mighty Joe Bob (37)</title>

<p>When Mighty Joe Bob was alive, the country was young and hadn't yet learned
the hard lessons that make forests wilt and deserts grow. The buffalo were
ardent, and distributed leaflets by the millions in thundering herds all
across the land. And Mighty Joe Bob knew every inch of land and every wild
critter, and they all knew and loved Mighty Joe Bob, except when he didn't
take his Prozac.
</p>

<p>Now Mighty Joe Bob lived in a sasquatch tree way out west, and when they
repealed the rent control laws, he had to move out, because he had no money
because he had never worked a day in his life, because who needs to when
every wild critter knows and loves you? So he took up the slack and got his
dander up and said goodbye to his happy home of many years and went
adventuring up north.
</p>

<p>The ardent buffalo, what's left of them, say the northern lights are Mighty
Joe Bob setting fire to bear farts, that they're his way of telling us he's
all right, he's doing fine, and he's got some kind of brain damage that
they've just given up treating. But I don't know about that. Somehow I
think that even if he's still alive up there, he isn't all right. I've been
doing some research, and the Committee Archives don't have any record of
the last time his Prozac prescription was refilled. So let's just hope he
doesn't come back.
