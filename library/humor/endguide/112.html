<title>Road Kill (112)</title>

<body>
<p>I saw the cat lying by the side of the road while I was riding my bicycle
one day, many years ago. It was dead, of course. Its abdomen was flattened,
whether by decay or by traffic I do not know. Flies hovered around it, now
and again landing, on some obscure fly mission.
</p>

<p>Its head was more or less intact, and it was at a curious angle, as if
facing oncoming traffic with a defiant curiosity. When I saw it, it was
getting dark, and the oncoming headlights were reflected in its eyes.
</p>

<p>I still remember it.
</p>

<p>Why do I still remember it?
</p>

<p>I want to stop remembering it.
</p>

<p>Please help me stop remembering it.
</p>

<p>Must I remember it forever?
