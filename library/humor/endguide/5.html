<title>The Awful Truth (5)</title>

<p>There, off in the distance, where once the proud flecks of burnished peat
hovered over the dusty flapjacks, it now stands and stinks. Its eyes, like
jet black sacs of venom, scour the barren countryside. Occasionally, like
some giant dyspeptic walrus, it wriggles grotesquely and profanes the air
with noisome eruptions of sound and vapor. It resides in a shallow
crater-like depression, as if the very land around it were sagging with the
burden, not of carrying its foul weight, but of merely *knowing* of its
eternal presence there, bearing down on the helpless soil like a thousand
eons of vile sin. It also dispenses minty treats from a small vending area
near the bottom.
</p>

<p>As the inimical circle of blight approaches the surrounding farms, creeping
ever so slightly closer as the seasons whirl past, the families there are
born, grow up, raise children, and die, generation upon generation; they no
longer see it. It is a terror from their childhood, that they have learned to
put behind them as they put their childhood behind them. They harvest their
poisoned crops with only a mild uneasiness and faint body odor to remind
them of the horror in their midst that they have learned not to see.
</p>

<p>But now and again, a traveller passes this way, despite the shadow over the
land. Perhaps his map has led him across some back road, unsuspected on any
other map. Perhaps a heavy storm has caused him to misread the road signs.
It doesn't matter. He will never return. He will be drawn inexorably to the
center, to the creature, to be devoured, to make it stronger. But he will
enjoy a nice minty treat on his way to hell.
