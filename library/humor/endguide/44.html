<p>Carefully examine your rows. They must be neat to attract the fruit gods.
Each plant must be firmly clamped to its neighbor, lest they grow restless.
Pewter reproductions of dung beetles, liberally spread among the vines,
will provide hours of entertainment to the salesmen, but be sure to spay or
neuter any that fall in your web. Now lean back and enjoy.
</p>

<p>Your garden is a reflection of your character. Do you have bats? Then let
there be guano in the greenery. Do you shed tiny droplets of chloroform?
Then by all means, obtain an ointment. Your neighbors are watching you, and
they may pounce while you sleep. Lock up your tractor, but leave the keys
wedged in an orifice; this will bring good fortune and cavities.
</p>

<p>The ancients have a word for the harmony of the garden, but it is rude. Do
not let this dissuade you. Carve fringes into your leaves for a Western
look. Rub the seedlings with balm to make them sweat. The possibilities are
yours for the asking, if you have a stamped self-addressed envelope, and
there is no substitute for a good piece of veal. Pound it gently as it
floats, shimmering, down into the bin. Do not mar its delicate course, or
you will be afflicted with sores. I warned you.
</p>

<p>After the shooting pains come, and the frost coats your ankles, your garden
will be there, softly whispering the football scores, and awaiting the day
when you bless it with dung. Don't disappoint it.
