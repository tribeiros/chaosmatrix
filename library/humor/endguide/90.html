<title>Dust to Dust (90)</title>

<p>They are deep within the earth, and you will not find them, because they
are not there when you look. While you search for them, they are in your
house, moving your furniture, dancing with your wife; and when you return,
they will have touched all your cheese.
</p>

<p>Pile high the barriers, but you will not keep them out. They are
fertilizing the rhododendrites in your brain, and wishing will not make it
otherwise. Add water and stand back - your life will never be the same
because it never was the same to begin with. They know that, and they want
to teach it to you. What are you afraid of?
</p>

<p>Do you think they allow the dust to accrete because they are frightened of
it? No, they know that they will endure, and they have a great cloth they
will unfold to capture the dust. You are the dust. You are settling on
their statue of a world, and when they inscribe "CLEAN ME" with their
fingers of power, you are taken away with them. The empty void where you
once were is filled by other dust, all alike, all insignificant.
</p>

<p>Do not let their lessons thrash you without good effect. You must learn
from them, and they will in turn take you for a spin in their chariots of
unstable powder. Above all, do not confuse them with Them. When they send
you postcards, treasure them, and when you have them all, you will
understand where they went on their vacation; but remember, they have a
spare set of keys to your brain, and they like to drop in unannounced.
