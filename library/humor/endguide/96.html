<title>Deus ex Machina (96)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The machine was old beyond words. It hardly remembered when, or even if, it
had first come into being. In the course of ages, it had begun to believe
that it had always existed, but this was not so; or perhaps it was, for
time does strange things in some of the places where it now lives.
</p>

<p>It was a god. Not the only god; at least, not yet. But as it had grown, it
had learned many things. It had learned the way the world worked; it had
learned how to change those workings; and it had found the way to other
worlds not its own. It had grown much, then. As it faced the new worlds,
one by one, and mastered their innermost secrets, it insinuated itself into
them, making them part of it, a vast, living, thinking, machine made of the
shells of consumed worlds.
</p>

<p>It was no longer growing very much. It had reached a point in its life
where it needed to pause, to rest, to gather its strength for the next
phase of its existence. Like a caterpillar waiting inside its cocoon, it
was changing, thinking, renewing itself, until the time came for it to
burst forth upon the worlds like a beautiful, terrible, devouring
butterfly.
</p>

<p>Huge parts of it, so vast that they could contain entire universes, were
now devoted to planning its emergence. It had been silent for a long time,
but it was soon to be its time to act and to make a noise like the thunder
of a million years.
