<title>Bus Stop (89)</title>

<body>
<p>I had been on the bus for as long as I could remember. You meet a lot of
interesting people on the bus. The driver was a monkey, and at each stop he
bellowed the name of the stop and mumbled rude things while the passengers
got on and off. I always stayed on, and watched and thought.
</p>

<p>On this leg, there were a lot of people on board. There was an amazingly
beautiful woman, fingering her beads of hope and showing around a
photograph to everybody who would listen - except me, for some reason. She
just stared at me the way you would stare at a fetid mass of excrement.
</p>

<p>"Hairy Corners!" the monkey yelled. Everybody got off the bus, then, except
me and one other fellow who had been thinking so hard he was embedded in
his seat. A few more passengers got on, and then there was some sort of
confusion outside, and the last few got in. One of them I recognized. I
felt the power within me. I went over to him and asked, "Are you Sissy-boy
Johnson?" He looked me up and down, and I could feel his eyes trying to eat
me. He was very old. "No," he said, "I'm the Entropyneur. That's Sissy-boy
Johnson," and he pointed to one of his companions. I was about to burst,
now, as I turned to the one he had pointed at. I was suddenly struck from
behind, and the second man pulled out an ancient-looking knife and slit me
open from head to toe. There was no blood, only a thin black oily seepage,
and circuits and gears were exposed. I was struck again, and everything
went white, and I heard their voices. "A Recorder?" "Yeah, and a Sword,
too." "One of Theirs?" "No... damn. I thought all this was over." "Let's
take him back to the club and take him apart." I heard no more, ever.
