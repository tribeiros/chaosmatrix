<title>Rise Up and Smite Me, Why Don't You (42)</title>
</head>

<p>You make me sick. You damn ancient evils are all alike, all full of hot
air. Go ahead, rise up and smite me, why don't you. You pansy. Are all of
the Old Ones little sissy-boys like you? That's why you're all hiding. You
dumbass. I oughtta teach you a lesson. Now I know why R'lyeh didn't get one
of the NFL expansion teams. You're a bunch of loser has-beens.
</p>

<p>What? Are you talking to me? Are you talking to ME? Why don't you just go
back to your non-Euclidean apartment, it's probably all done in pastels,
isn't it, ya fairy. I ain't afraid of you. Ya see, I'm working with Them.
</p>

<p>Oh, trying to make nice now, aren't you? Whaddya doin', calling up some of
your fungi buddies? Can't take me yourself, is that it? I knew it. Well,
I'm under Their protection, so even if I couldn't kick your ass from here
to Yuggoth without even MOVING, when They found out what you did They'd
come down on you so hard you'd think... well, something bad would happen,
anyway. To you.
</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before. You may think the Committee Man
is on your team, but They've got something he wants, and he won't cross
them. Not to save your sorry ass. You're just a bit player in this game,
Kapoopoo or whatever the hell your name is, and that's all you'll ever be.
Now either give me my lottery ticket or give me my dollar back, or I'm
calling the manager.
