<title>Memories of Catherine, in Bronze (60)</title>

<p>We strolled through cabbage-lined promenades, laughing gaily at each
other's gait. In the horse meadow, we lined up to pluck old Barney's
eyebrows for fifty cents. We had them bronzed, I remember, as a keepsake
from that day.
</p>

<p>It began to rain cats and dogs, and we each took one, I a cat, and she a
dog, and we wrapped them over our heads and made the best of it. Downtown,
we rode on the ferrous wheel. Uptown, we rented a pavilion and put on a
show - Catherine won an award for her performance in "Treacle and
Protuberances" that day. We had the other actors bronzed, I remember, as a
keepsake.
</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went down to the park and set up a terrorist sting
operation. Catherine was at her most beautiful as she rounded up the
scoundrels that day. I remember that we had one of them, Mustapha, bronzed
as a keepsake.
</p>

<p>As we relaxed among the medieval guildsmen in the forest, listening to them
belt out their great mix of soft rock from the sixties, seventies, and
eighties, Catherine and I picked out a cooper to bronze later in the
evening. We munched lazily on our supply tubing. When we got to the river
(which I hadn't remembered being there) we hurled our animals, I my cat and
Catherine her dog, into its mighty depths, and as the froth they stirred up
sped downstream, we resolved to remember this blissful day forever. I'm
still working on a way to bronze it.
