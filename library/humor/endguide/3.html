<title>O Wondrous Llama (3)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Much is made of the llama, that frisky little critter who is frequently
glimpsed chewing on large distended sacks of filth over by the side of the
highways and byways of this great land. But how much do we really know
about this rakish knave, this whimsical creeper in the twilight world of
the underbrush? What are his habits, his dreams, his preoccupations, his
intimate hygienic problems, his credit card numbers?
</p>

<p>At home, the llama is a savage brute, fond of rubbing ferns on his bottom
and playing the kazoo. He beats his children daily with hardened balls of
inexplicably furry mucus. And yet, there is a softer side. He is an
accomplished cinematographer, and occasionally poses for modelling shots
that would make any upstanding citizen cringe in fear. On weekends, and
during periods of heavy downpours, he will go from door to door collecting
newspapers, which he then laboriously molds into tiny blowfish.
</p>

<p>We are left, after examining the evidence, feeling that we have never
really gotten to the soul of this dashing charlatan of the woods. He
remains, as ever, an enigma, aloof, forbidding, and perpetually infected.
Perhaps man was never meant to know the dark secrets of this peripatetic
"Mime of the Deep". We can only peek at his towering form behind the safety
of our custom blast shielding and wait for him to get out of the driveway,
all the while silently marveling at the crimes of Mother Nature.
