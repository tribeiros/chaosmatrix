<title>Salmonella for Two (64)</title>

<body>
<p>I had been to that new restaurant, "The Clap", and I had tried the
Infection Spectacular Seafood Platter. It is upon this dish that I blame
the events that followed; nevertheless, it sure was tasty. Anyway, we were
served at six, we were given the lip of madness at seven, and by eight, my
head had swelled up so much I couldn't get it out of the toilet.
</p>

<p>Using my remaining superpower ("slide everything as if it's on wheels") I
managed to get the toilet closer to the phone. I called the emergency number
and within seconds I felt the jaws of life clamping down on my nether
regions. Conchita, the lovely paramedic, deftly removed my brain, which
immediately eased the swelling. I was offered a banana to gum while they
sewed my head back up.
</p>

<p>Later, after I had photographed all the axe damage and had a good round of
tiddly-winks with Conchita, she advised me to seek professional help. I
asked if I could see her again, and she explained that she was taking
lessons in French-kissing electric outlets from now until doomsday, and we
made it a date for exactly one week after doomsday. I can hardly wait.
</p>

<p>I left my brain under my pillow that night, and in the morning I found that
the brain fairy had left me a breast pump. Puzzled, I placed it in the
trophy case with all the others and went back to bed, wondering where I
would be able to take Conchita if the universe had been gone for a week.
