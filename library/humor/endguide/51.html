<p>Okay, here's the plan. We fly down into the valley in the shape of an
enourmous trout. When I give the signal, you hurl influenza dust at the
natives. Barry will be holding the cheese for us in case it gets nasty.
We'll refuel at dusk, and I'll have a choice steak waiting in the
laboratory.
</p>

<p>After that, we can begin pounding chocolates into the heads of the sample
animals that Barry has in his pants. The ones that don't fret will be
selected for the next phase of the mission, I call it "Operation Creme de
Menthe", but not out loud. As you use the egg slicer to eviscerate the
Colonel, I will carry his fabulous shins to be sold at an auction, where I
will be in disguise as "El Torpedo", the Australasian autophage. With the
proceeds, Barry will lease a stump, and we'll roll that over into a mutual
fund so fast your head will spin.
</p>

<p>Now, Keith, you have a special, absolutely critical part to play in this
plan. Unfortunately, I accidentally rolled up my notes into a tube and sat
on them, so I'm afraid you will have to improvise.
</p>

<p>All right, we're ready to go. I promise that if we are successful, then after
the mission, Rhonda here and her lovely friends will have plenty of covert
action for all of you.
