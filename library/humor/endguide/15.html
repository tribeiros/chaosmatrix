<title>Letter from Home (15)</title>

<p>Hope this letter finds you and the gang all well. Daisy is still
recovering from a bad case of flintlock, as you may have heard, and Anton
and Selma have been taking shifts on the bellows all night just to keep her
stable. We'll be sending out photos of her just as soon as we can get her
nostril swelling down a bit.
</p>

<p>The bile storms have taken a great toll here. We lost half the crop to the
pellets, and most of the other half was taken by wolverines. We're still
hopeful that the remainder will fetch a healthy price at the market though,
thanks to a vigorous program of sabotage and assasination of other local
farmers. And Anton says he's whipped up a combination of bubonic plague and
free-floating anxiety that'll have the entire county on its knees before
the end of the month.
</p>

<p>We lost the codebook, so we've been sending the messages to Uncle Pavel in
cleartext, if you know what I mean. Hope this doesn't get him into too much
trouble!
</p>

<p>Well, I think I hear one of the kids catching fire again, so I'll have to
wrap this up quick. Best wishes to you and Liz with the napalm collective,
and mother wants me to ask you to let her know what she should do with the
mojo bag you left in her sock drawer - she wants to throw it out because
it's stinking up the place. Write back soon! XOXOXOXO
