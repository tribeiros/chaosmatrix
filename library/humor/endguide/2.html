<title>Those Things (2)</title>

<p>I don't mind telling you, I saw that lady, and I don't know how she gets
away with it. Those bloated things wouldn't pass inspection if he were a
*real* man, no sir, like, if it was me, I'd just knock the stuffing right
out of 'em, give 'em the old once-over, you know. And I don't know *what*
that goddamn green stuff is. I bet it reeks.
</p>

<p>I guess she thinks they don't notice, what with all the fumes. She probably
thinks she can just slide on in their on her e-lectric scooter, and pull
the wool over their eyes with those - those - those *things*. I wouldn't
buy one. Probably get botulism, or anthrax, or something even worse. Maybe
develop a spoonerism, or aneurysm, or whatever the hell they are. Makes me
wanna puke just thinkin' about it. And they don't even have any *pockets*!
</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that they really know what's going on, and they're
watching her, waiting, until she's cleaning the cage and looks away for a
second, just a second, and then *POW* they're up and out of the cage and
eating her eyeballs right out of their sockets and running up the long
distance bill and ain't NOBODY gonna pay THAT piper.
</p>

<p>Oh, man, he bought one. He just up and bought one, even with all the foam,
and stuff. I hope he got his shots.
