<title>Heritage of the Ants</title>

<body>
<p>There's a magic in the air. The soft piles of flying manatee dung that dot
the earth catch the rays of the rising sun, and glint with the promise of a
new day. The world is new, and like all new things, still has a few bugs.
</p>

<p>One of these bugs is an Ant. That's right, an Ant, not an ant. His name is
Adam. He is the first Ant, because, as I said, the world is new. The ants
who were to come after were but cheap copies of the Ants, their genes
polluted by untold generations of Zima-drinking and fornication with
evildoers. The Ants were as much superior to the ants as the ants of the
First World were to those of this, the Second World. Really, they're just
super people. And who hasn't heard the ancient story of Adam and the rubber
tree plant? Nobody. So let's get right back to the fornication with
evildoers. I will quote from Erratica II 3:4-7:
</p>

<p>"Ye ants, ye dainty denizens of the dells, where are your gardens now? Your
amateur productions? The hamsters are nigh! Heed me, ye sitters on the
gilded patios! For the Sheep of the Ages hears you not, and is not mindful
of you. When the hooting of the muffins draws near, your pleas will avail ye
not."
</p>

<p>I hope that clears things up. For those of you keeping score, the ants are
ahead, but losing ground rapidly.
