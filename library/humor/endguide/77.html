<p>Sissy-boy Johnson sat back and enjoyed the radio, while his fabulous new
Bolus Impacta cruised along the desert highway. He - rather, it - had been
driving for days, while he blissed out in the back seat. Suddenly, as if
the car knew where it was going (which it did), it stopped. The radio
stopped, too, and he sighed and got out.
</p>

<p>In the arsenal of information he carried in his job as a private
investigator, there was one weapon that was so powerful and so precious and
so rare that he had never dared to use it. He still had misgivings about
using it even now, but She had talked him into it. She was very persuasive
when She wanted to be. He looked out over the silent dunes and prayed that
it was still where it was supposed to be, and that the highway would still
be there when he returned. Tucking his supply of time roaches into his
backpack, he headed off over the sand.
</p>

<p>After he had found the right dune, he still had hours of sifting and
searching to do, but finally, it paid off. He had found it. He was a bit
hungry now, and this was one task he didn't relish the idea of performing
on an empty stomach, so he pulled out a notebook and, following the
instructions therein carefully, traced mystic circles and runes in the
sand. Shortly thereafter, a teenager in the pointy-hatted uniform of
Swayback's Mystickal Pizza appeared. He paid the delivery boy, who promptly
vanished in a puff of smoke. He ate almost the entire pizza; the two
remaining slices he folded up and put in his pocket for later. It was time.
He placed the single precious grain of sand in his palm and stared at it.
