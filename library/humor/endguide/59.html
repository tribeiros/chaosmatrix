<title>Neon Quest (59)</title>

<body>
<p>I was really hung over with a triple indemnity and the logos of a thousand
corporate hyenas swarmed in the air around me. I followed the neon, because
that's where the money goes.
</p>

<p>Stopping by a brothel for directions, the staff eunuch introduces me to
Mania. She dances for me. I pooh-pooh her. She dances some more; I
pooh-pooh some more. In this way, we spend many enjoyable evenings. But my
astronomical observations urge me to move on; I can tarry here no more. I
steal some pens on my way out.
</p>

<p>On the dusty road, I encounter a messenger of the Fortunate One. We play
chess. I defeat him, and he signs over to me one of his cousins. We bow to
each other as we go our separate ways.
</p>

<p>I reached a place where the neon went into the ground. There was an old man
in a jumpsuit sitting in the position of the Depleted Sterno. Surely, he
was a great master. I sat down next to him, facing the same direction as
him, using the less difficult position of the Nervous Frog. "Master," I
ask, "can you lead me?"
</p>

<p>I will never forget his words of wisdom, nor will I ever master them. He
said, "Do not eat candied yams, lest ye die; but in the four corners of the
public restroom, you shall find out what a breakfast yum-yum is." I
returned home a chastened man.
