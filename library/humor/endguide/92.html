<p>I entered the Lords of Entropy Institute of Cosmological Studies and
Nightclub with a certain amount of trepidation. I had the feeling that
something was up. It was dark in there, as befits the unholy things that go
on there, especially the food. On my way to my regular table, the
Entropyneur caught my arm. "Ace," he said, "there's somebody here I think
you should meet." He had his ghost show me to the table.
</p>

<p>At the table, way in the back of the club where the floor was stained with
the residue of some of the rowdier but less successful patrons, in a booth
seat, was Sissy-boy Johnson, the Procto-Astrologer. Nobody knew how
Sissy-boy had become a Procto-Astrologer, but everybody knew it meant he
had an endless supply of magic beans. He was clutching a suitcase full of
asparagus and leaking a thin stream of motor oil from some of his more
disreputable pores. I decided to take advantage of this unexpected meeting
to see if he had any information on my target. I showed him Her picture. He
stared at me, uncomprehending, and rocked back and forth, and with each
rocking movement tiny bits of shredded cabbage fell out of his pants legs.
</p>

<p>Repelled, I lurched away from the table. I grabbed the notice of the
Entropyneur's ghost with crazed hand signals, and asked him what had
happened to this poor creature. He explained that Sissy-boy's tongue had
been lanced by a frosted nightmare in an expedition under some volcano, and
that he was no longer Sissy-boy Johnson, the Procto-Astrologer, but
Sissy-boy Johnson, the Crypto-Procto-Astrologer. I didn't really want any
more sordid details, so I went quietly to my usual table and drank heavily.
