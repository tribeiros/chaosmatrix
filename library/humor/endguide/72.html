<title>The Eclectic Collector (72)</title>

<body>
<p>In the event that you weren't listening, I will repeat it, only much
louder. However, I feel this may not be sufficient. Lend me your ear. I
will return it unharmed, I promise. But if you doubt me, then please
examine this juicy slab of meat, well-marbled, and coated with flavors
unheard of in the realms in which you move. Hear how it tinkles with the
music of the spheres. I can see that it entices you, but remember your
manners; drooling does not become you.
</p>

<p>I have decided not to repeat it after all. I am fickle, but I do not tip
over readily, so it all balances out. Instead, let me show you some more of
my collection, since you seem to enjoy it so much. Please wear this badge
of linoleum. It will protect you from the sloth.
</p>

<p>As you pass down the hall, you will see many things. First is my exquisite
crystal of envy. Next, a rare treat, a physicist completely encased in
tropical oils. I know, you're thinking, "What's rare about that?" Well,
stop it. Here we have a roiling sea of potato lions. Watch as their buds
wave frivolously at you. And now, here is the special grotto I have
prepared for you. Go ahead! Have a seat! Do not resist. You are quite
powerless to avoid your fate. I will have you, buttered side up, performing
obscure ballet moves in time to the thumping of the rapture owls. For you
see, I've never met as big a goober as yourself; the moment you opened your
mouth I knew I must have you for my collection.
</p>

<p>The curator will be by shortly to install your catheter.
