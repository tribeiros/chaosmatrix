<title>Never Trust an Aztec God (56)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So I was running low on funds, you know, moolah, and my eternity bill was
coming due, so I rented the lower planes to one of those Aztec gods, I
forget whether it was Huitzilopochtli or Tlaloc, it was the rain god
anyway, for a thousand dark souls a month. And wouldn't you know it but he
stiffed me and left the place a mess to boot.
</p>

<p>So I decided I'd paint his wagon real good, and I went down to
Conquistadors 'R' Us, planning to buy a Cortez and send him back with some
time roaches to smite old what's-his-face's temples, but the man said they
were all out, the only available Cortez was in the shop and would I like
some gumdrops instead? No, I wouldn't, you twit.
</p>

<p>So then, hoping to drown my sorrows, I went down to the Lords of Entropy
Institute of Cosmological Studies and Nightclub. Nasty Handful was playing,
but you could still hear yourself think, because the Entropyneur had them
only partially materialized for alleged "thermodynamic reasons". Mmm-hmm.
</p>

<p>About halfway through the evening I met this guy, his name was Sissy-boy
Johnson, he showed me a picture of a young-old man with a tiny dalmatian
and centuries of evil in his eyes, and I id'ed him. "That's the Committee
Man. He's bad stuff." He thanked me and bought my time roaches for a
healthy sum. He asked me what I did, and I told him I was a maker of
worlds, and he said there was going to be a big shakeout in that business
pretty soon but he had some friends among the Elder Gods who might throw
some business my way.
