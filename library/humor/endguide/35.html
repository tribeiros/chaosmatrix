<title>Vengeance of the Ants (35)</title>

<p>When the signal went up, the lookouts in the hills would allow no delay.
They knew their mission: their life meant nothing except for moments like
this. The attack was on, the enemy had shown a weakness, and the entire
countryside was like a tightly wound coil, ready to explode into action at
the opportunity.
</p>

<p>One messenger relayed the word to two, two to four, four to eight, and the
word went streaming throughout the land, even into the forest of Petrified
Veal. Even the children grabbed their pointy sticks. And in the designated
assembly areas, first in trickles, then in mobs, the army assembled, and
the cry went up, the cry of vengeance: "We are the earwigs, we are the
FEARwigs!"
</p>

<p>The bloodthirsty congregation set off at breakneck speed, pausing only as
it approached the target. In a clearing, unawares, a crew of hamsters was
sleeping off a mighty load. The scene that followed was too grisly to
describe here; suffice it to say that there were numerous tiny cries of
"Tastes just like chicken!" until well into the morning. And many little
earwigs were conceived in the celebrations that followed, safely back home.
</p>

<p>This went on for many years, until at last only the old, stringy, tough
hamsters were left, and then there were, at last, none. The earwigs, having
completed the final mission for which they had been designed, left the
world for happier days, and the last of the ants had the last laugh after
all.
