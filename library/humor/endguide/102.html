<title>Paper or Plastic (102)</title>

<p>"Paper or plastic?" they ask endlessly. What do they mean? Are they asking
me what I want to pay with? To wrap my groceries in? To wrap my body in
when I die? Paper, then, reams of it, thick enough to reach the stars. You
will never find enough, because I will not die.
</p>

<p>Even as my body rots in the ground, I will live on; I am the wave function
that does not collapse; I am the observer, never the observed. I will
thread my way through worlds until I find the one where I still live. You
see me, and in seeing me, you destroy me, but I see you also, destroying
you. We will die together forever, and forever live apart.
</p>

<p>Who told you of this "death" thing? Has it ever happened to you? I thought
not. You have seen it happen, I am sure, to others, or heard about it. But
you are a self, and they are just shadows of selves that appear to you in
your world. In the world that is truly your own, the world where you really
live, they are not there. Their worlds touch yours, but in time they will
leave, to go on existing in their own separate place.
</p>

<p>When I no longer touch your world, I will remember you. One day we shall
touch again, for are not all things possible in time? When all that exists
is merely probable, who is to say? You know the places where anything may
happen. They have been set in the centers of the galaxies like gems,
awaiting our arrival. Let us meet there once we have learned the truth, and
our worlds will become one, and together we will choose both paper *and*
plastic.
