<title>Learn to Breathe (101)</title>

<body>
<p>Practice your breathing. In. Out. In. Out. Listen, now. The gentle breezes
of Fate are blowing a pickup truck into your life. Do not resist its gentle
rubber caresses. The treads will pass, and help is on the way.
</p>

<p>In the big room, they are shining lights into your abdomen. Men trained for
long years to tweak your innards are laying you open, secure in the
knowledge that you are one of their kind. But what if you're not? How will
you defend yourself against their depredations, lying unconscious on the
table? They're playing poker, and your organs are the chips. I'll raise you
a spleen, and teach it to be a fine dancer. When it leaves home I will cry,
but I will know it is the right thing.
</p>

<p>Years later, misshapen, alone, you spend your afternoons frightening
children who walk through your yard. You harpoon the school bus, and drag
them all screaming into your foul den, there to lend a dainty flavor to
your soups. The driver's shrunken dried cadaver is your Christmas tree
ornament, the first of many, to be handed down to the eldest of your army
of clones.
</p>

<p>As you practice your breathing, your thoughts turn to my tune. I will make
you remember your future, and in so doing you will live to regret the
choices you have yet to make. When you make those choices again, I will be
there laughing at you. I hear the blond ones go best with cream soups.
