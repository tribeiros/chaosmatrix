<H1>Antigravity, The Feline Butterology Theory</H1>

<P><HR><P>

 Captured from the Usenet Oracle, 19930625<P>

 This question was posed to the Usenet Oracle:<P>

 If you drop a buttered piece of bread, it will fall on the floor
butter-side down. If a cat is dropped from a window or other high and
towering place, it will land on its feet.  But what if you attach a
buttered piece of bread, butter-side up to a cat's back and toss them
both out the window? Will the cat land on its feet?  Or will the butter
splat on the ground?<P>

 And in response, thus spoke the Oracle:<P>

 Even if you are too lazy to do the experiment yourself you should be
able to deduce the obvious result. The laws of butterology demand that
the butter must hit the ground, and the equally strict laws of feline
aerodynamics demand that the cat can not smash its furry back. If the
combined construct were to land, nature would have no way to resolve
this paradox. Therefore it simply does not fall.<P>

 That's right, you clever mortal (well, as clever as a mortal can get),
you have discovered the secret of antigravity! A buttered cat will, when
released, quickly move to a height where the forces of cat-twisting and
butter repulsion are in equilibrium. This equilibrium point can be
modified by scraping off some of the butter, providing lift, or removing
some of the cat's limbs, allowing descent.<P>

 Most of the civilized species of the Universe already use this
principle to drive their ships while within a planetary system. The loud
humming heard by most sighters of UFOs is, in fact, the purring of
several hundred tabbies.<P>

 The one obvious danger is, of course, if the cats manage to eat the
bread off their backs they will instantly plummet. Of course the cats
will land on their feet, but this usually doesn't do them much good,
since right after they make their graceful landing several tons of
red-hot starship and pissed-off aliens crash on top of them.<P>

<H3>Flaws In the Flying Cat Theory: A Response</H3>

 Special to the Coastal Beacon<P>

 A logical analysis of the BFAD (Buttered Feline Antigravity Drive)
propulsion theory clearly demonstrates the impossibility of such a
system.<P>

 Let us begin with a simple analysis. 1) Buttered bread must fall butter
side down.  2) A cat always lands on its feet.<P>

 While both theorems are indisputable, the oracle offers no proof of the
construct. The oracle implies that anyone who 'would' test this
construct would immediately find the secret of BFAD.<P>

 This is clearly nonsense.<P>

 Let us assume a normal Einsteinian universe (although a Euclidean
universe would serve our purposes just as well, the Einsteinian is both
cheaper and drinks are readily available.)<P>

 To test BFAD, one must procure:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Bread
<LI>Butter (margarine, for some reason, will not work)
<LI>A cat
<LI>A strapping device.
</UL>

 Let us assume that all of these are readily available.<P>

 Attach the strapping device to the cat.<P>

 See?<P>

 No cat.<P>

 What has happened? We have run up against an a priori universal law. By
a priori, we mean that it takes priority over either the Buttered Bread
Principle or the Law of Feline Landings.<P>

 What happens is that the instant a strapping device and a cat occupy
the same four dimensional space, the cat disappears.  Now, this can
easily be tested, and has been repeatedly. There are two schools of
thought about this phenomenon.<P>

 The first holds that a cat and a strapping device are constituted out
of different fundamental building blocks. According to this theory, a
cat is constituted primarily of superquarks, (called meows by current
theorists.) These superquarks demonstrate qualities that are both atomic
(constituted as they are of groupings of normal quark particles) and
feline (because these quarks exhibit characteristic of "charmed"  or
"lucky" particles.) Again, according to this theory, strapping materials
are fashioned out of non-charmed particles. Bringing the two together
causes one or the other to cancel out. One aspect of this theory that
has not been sufficiently explained to date is the fact that it is
always the cat, not the strapping device, that disappears.<P>

 The second school of thought, and it is one that appears to be gaining
ground in academic circles today, holds that cats are, in fact,
super-intelligent pan-dimensional beings who exist in our four
dimensional universe only because there is plenty of good food and a lot
of creatures stupid enough to provide the food, along with plenty of
attention.<P>

 Whenever a strapping device appears, the cat simply opens a door to a
different series of dimensions, and goes on an extended tour.<P>

 According to this theory, purring is a cat's way of maintaining a
constant balance cycling across multiple dimensions. This school holds
that antigravity is impossible, but that theoretically, a REALLY good
grip on a cat, while reaching for a strapping device, could result in
our ability to cross dimensions with ease (barring scratches, that is.)
Pessimists argue that if there were anything really interesting in those
other dimensions, cats wouldn't spend so much time here, so why ask for
a good scratching?<P>
