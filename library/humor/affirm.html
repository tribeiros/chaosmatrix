<H1>Ineffective Daily Affirmations</H1>
<H3>by Eggnoramus</H3>

<P><HR><P>

Feeling blue or insecure? Losing sight of what's important? Still
searching for the real "you"?
In this self-help age of soul-searching, daily affirmations have been
known to do the trick. But you probably shouldn't try these ... <P>


<UL>

<LI>I have the power to channel my imagination into ever-soaring levels of
suspicion and paranoia.

<LI>I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones that are someone
else's fault.

<LI>I no longer need to punish, deceive or compromise myself. Unless, of course, I
want to stay employed.

<LI>In some cultures what I do would be considered normal.

<LI>Having control over myself is nearly as good as having control over others.

<LI>My intuition nearly makes up for my lack of good judgment.

<LI>I can change any thought that hurts into a reality that hurts even more.

<LI>I honor my personality flaws, for without them I would have no personality at
all.

<LI>Joan of Arc heard voices too.

<LI>I am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all those censorious, self-
righteous people around me.

<LI>I need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper and complain.

<LI>When someone hurts me, forgiveness is cheaper than a lawsuit. But not nearly
as gratifying.

<LI>All of me is beautiful and valuable, even the ugly, stupid and disgusting
parts.

<LI>I am at one with my duality.

<LI>Only a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself with imaginary
fears.

<LI>I honor and express all facets of my being, regardless of state and local
laws.

<LI>Today I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there are no sweeter
words than "I told you so."

<LI>A good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution to the problem.

<LI>I am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as sabotage.

<LI>Becoming aware of my character defects leads me to the next step -- blaming my
parents.

<LI>I will find humor in my everyday life by looking for people I can laugh
at.
