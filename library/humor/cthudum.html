There seems to be a lot of Cthulu humor out there.  Perhaps this is the the
way people who deal with Cthulu stay sane.  In any case, I have had a lot of
Cthulu humor sent to me over the years, and this piece is one of them.
Unfortunately, I had to change the title.  It was originally entitled "Cthulu
for Dummies" but I have received a <A HREF="cthudum2.html">legal notice from
the greyfaces at IDG Books</A> (who produce the "...For Dummies(R)" books)
telling me that "it is highly likely that visitors could be misled into
believing that this article was authorized by or is associated with IDGB."  In
other words, they have no sense of humor and seem to think that we're all so
stupid that we can't tell a joke from the real thing.<P>

IDG Books has asked me to "remove the infringing material from the Web page
and anywhere else it appears and provide IDGB with your written assurances
that you will refrain from infringing on its trademarks."<P>

To satisfy IDGB I have changed the offending title from "Cthulu for Dummies"
to "Cthulu for Morons".  Last I checked, they did not have a "...For Morons"
registered trademark, so this should deal with the legal problem.<P>

Secondly, I am choosing to exercise my First Ammendment right to free speech,
using this webpage as my forum.  I had always enjoyed the "...For Dummies(R)"
series put out by IDG Books, but I refuse to do business with a company that
has no sense of humor, and can't even ask me politely to remove the material
before threatening me with legal action that "if this matter cannot be
immediately resolved, IDGB is fully prepared to enforce its rights."  So I
hereby declare that I am boycotting all IDGB products, including ancillary
products licensed from IDGB bearing the "...For Dummies(R)" trademark.  I
encourage others to do the same.  If you would like to look at the <A
HREF="cthudum2.html">legal notice from the greyfaces at IDG Books</A> to see
just what pissed me off, please do so.<P>

<P><HR><P>

"...For Dummies(R)" is a Registered Trademark owned by IDG Books Worldwide
("IDGB").  Use of the name of any product without mention of trademark status
in this article should not be construed as a challenge to such status.  The
inclusion of these product names in no way implies any approved usage or
official licensing of the contents of this article with the aforementioned
products.<P>

"Cthulu for Morons" is a humorous spoof of IDGB's "...For Dummies(R)" line of
reference books.  If you didn't have enough brainpower to figure that out in
the first place, you probably shouldn't be messing around with Cthulu anyway,
humorous or otherwise.<P>
