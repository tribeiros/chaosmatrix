<H1>Knowledge, Power, Time, Work and Money
Equations</H1>
<H3>From: Skull (skull@yakko.cs.wmich.edu)</H3>

<HR>

Knowledge is Power<BR>
Time is Money<BR>
and as every engineer knows, Power is Work over Time.<P>

So, substituting algebraic equations for these time worn bits of wisdom,
we get:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>K = P       (1)
<LI>T = M       (2)
<LI>P = W/T     (3)
</UL>

Now, do a few simple substitutions:<P>

Put W/T in for P in equation (1), which yields:<P>

<UL>
<LI>K = W/T  (4)<P>
</UL>

Put M in for T into equation (4), which yields:<P>

<UL>
<LI>K = W/M  (5)
</UL>

Now we've got something.  Expanding back into English, we get:<P>

Knowledge equals Work over Money.<P>

What this MEANS is that:<P>

<OL>
<LI>The More You Know, the More Work You Do, and
<LI>The More You Know, the Less Money You Make.
</OL>

Solving for Money, we get:<P>

<UL>
<LI>M = W/K  (6)
</UL>

Money equals Work Over Knowledge.<P>

From equation (6) we see that Money approaches infinity as Knowledge
approaches 0, regardless of the Work done.<P>

What THIS MEANS is:<P>

The More you Make, the Less you Know.<P>

Solving for Work, we get<P>

<UL>
<LI>W = M K  (7)
</UL>

Work equals Money times Knowledge<P>

From equation (7) we see that Work approaches 0 as Knowledge approaches 0.<P>

What THIS MEANS is:<P>

The stupid rich do little or no work.<P>

Working out the socioeconomic implications of this
breakthrough is left as an exercise for the reader.
