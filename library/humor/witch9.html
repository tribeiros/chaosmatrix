<H1>How to Become A Witch in Nine Easy Lessons</H1>
<H3>by Don McLeod</H3>

<P><HR><P>

In the 1980's it was fashionable to be interested in the New Age. This
is now a dreadful faux pas within the alternative scene, and in order
to be accepted in the 1990's metaphysical social set, one must have an
interest in Witchcraft or Paganism. Of course, you don't have to
actually belong to a coven in order to be thought of as a Witch, you
can bluff your way into being accepted as a fully fledged Witch simply
by knowing a few terms and dressing accordingly. This brings us to...<P>

Rule # 1: Image is Everything. After all, what's the good of being a
Witch if nobody knows you are one? You must therefore wear black at
all times. If possible, stay out of the sun until you become really
pale, as this makes the effect even better. For women (and adventurous
males) dark eyeliner and black nail polish can enhance this look. Also
wear crystals and cheap occult paraphernalia at all times, and make
sure that these are as gaudy and bizarre as possible, as this can only
help your image. Wearing a pentacle around your neck is an absolutely
necessary accessory - the bigger the better! Capes and cloaks are
optional around town - it depends on how much of a visual impact you
want to make, but either of these are also crucial apparel at any
ritual or gathering that you may attend.<P>

Rule # 2: Name Dropping is Good. Every serious student of The Craft
(and I'm talking here about the term for Witchcraft, not macrame)
knows the name Gerald Gardner. This man revitalised Witchcraft in the
mid 1900's with his book about the true history of The Old Religion
(some have called this book pure fiction, but only those picky few who
like books to be based on facts). Real Witches however, never let
historical accuracy get in the way of their spiritual path, so in
conversations with other Witches, quote his name as often as possible
(in tones of awe) and you will always be rewarded with smiles of
acceptance.<P>

Rule # 3: Past Life Name Dropping is Even Better. Tell everyone about
the past life memories that have been surfacing since you began
studying the Black Arts. It is especially useful to remember a past
lifetime as a Witch who was killed during the Inquisition, or at least
recall a lifetime as a famous occultist. My past lives have included
Aleister Crowley, Cagliostro, Mandrake the Magician, and most of the
cast of "Bewitched".<P>

Rule # 4: Behave Strangely. Never forget why it was that you wanted to
become a Witch - yes, so that you have an excuse for strange
behaviour. Previously labelled eccentric behaviour patterns can now be
accepted by others if they have a reason to explain it, even if that
reason for howling at full moons while naked is simply, "He/she is a
Witch, that's normal for them evidently." So, don't let your friends
down, behave strangely, you can get away with it now.<P>

Rule # 5: Watch Occult Movies. Make sure that you watch the movie
"Warlock" lots of times to perfect those soft landings after
over-indulging with the flying ointments (read as mead and weed).<P>

Rule # 6: Ready Yourself for Sex, Money and Power. Wasn't this the
other reason you were drawn to Witchcraft? In the past, adepts of the
occult were known to possess charismatic, lusty and powerful personas
- when people find out that you are a Witch, they may automatically
assume (and therefore empower you) with these same qualities. This may
sound
pretty good, but unfortunately in today's world, another group of
people have become even more established within the realms of kinky
sex sessions and unlimited power - yes, the politicians! Beware of
this elitist group of power-brokers...they don't want any competition
to their manipulative monopoly over the gullible public - hence the
laws against Witchcraft and divination that have remained unchanged for
centuries. So, if calling yourself a High Priest doesn't lead you to
unlimited sex, money and power - or if it does, but you then find
yourself as the target of political and legal harassment - you may have
to put aside your cloak and broomstick and pick up a pin-stripe suit
and a back-bench in Parliament. If you can't beat them, try bribery,
then if that doesn't work...join them!<P>

Rule # 7: Atmosphere is Essential. Your home must reflect your Witchy
nature. Incense must burn continuously. It's important that visitors
see clouds of incense smoke billowing from a spluttering censer in the
corner of your dim, dank and dusty home, so dismantle the smoke
detectors and start collecting strange little bottles of exotic
looking ingredients (use your imagination and label them with names
like powdered bat's eyes, or dried dragon's gonads). And if you don't
like housework, you can explain that the layer of dust that covers
your floors and furniture helps to neutralise the highly charged
psychic energy that results from your magical spells, thereby
protecting your home and possessions from electromagnetic
disintegration.<P>

Rule # 8: Be Patronising to Christians. In social discussions don't
forget to make plenty of derogatory remarks about fundamentalist
Christians, but remember to save your most biting comments for other
Witches that you don't get along with.<P>

Rule # 9: Brag About Your Psychic Powers. Any self-respecting Witch
will tell you that after their initiation to Witchcraft, their psychic
powers awakened and their tarot cards (which they always carry with
them) are now much easier to read (they now get something right once
in a while). They will also tell you that they can now sense energy
fields (in
other words, they don't bump into things as often as they used to).
Follow this example and brag about the rapid development of your
psychic abilities since your initiation. If asked about your
initiation ceremony, simply state that you were sworn to secrecy about
it, then quickly change the subject by mentioning your newly awakened
ability to detect Ley-lines, but try to remember that a Ley-line is
not a queue for the after-ritual orgy!<P>

Now you know how to pass yourself off as a real Witch, so place that
broomstick in a conspicuous corner (one that is not clouded by too
much incense smoke); pull on those black clothes; give everyone that
you meet a sinister look - and your social status will improve
overnight. If you do all of this successfully, you may even find
yourself with enough adoring acolytes so that you can start your own
coven! Good luck and Blessed Be!<P>
