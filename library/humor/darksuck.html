<H1>Dark Conspiracy Involving Electrical Power
Companies Surfaces</H1>

<HR>

For years the electrical utility companies have led the public to believe
they were in business to supply electricity to the consumer, a service for
which they charge a substantial rate.  The recent accidental acquisition
of secret records from a well k nown power company has led to a massive
research campaign which positively explodes several myths and exposes the
massive hoax which has been perpetrated upon the public by the power
companies. <P>

The most common hoax promoted the false concept that light b ulbs emitted
light;  in actuality, these 'light' bulbs actually absorb DARK which is
then transported back to the power generation stations via wire networks.
A more descriptive name has now been coined; the new scientific name for
the device is DARKSUCKER. <P>

This newsletter introduces a brief synopsis of the darksucker theory,
which proves the existence of dark and establishes the fact that dark has
great mass, and further, that dark particle (the anti-photon) is the
fastest known particle in the univers e.  Apparently, even the celebrated
Dr. Albert Einstein did not suspect the truth.. that just as COLD is the
absence of HEAT, LIGHT is actually the ABSENCE of DARK...  scientists have
now proven that light does not really exist! <P>

The basis of the darksuck er theory is that electric light bulbs suck
dark.  Take for example, the darksuckers in the room where you are right
now.  There is much less dark right next to the darksuckers than there is
elsewhere, demonstrating their limited range.  The larger the da rksucker,
the greater its capacity to suck dark.  Darksuckers in a parking lot or on
a football field have a much greater capacity than the ones used in the
home, for example. <P>

It may come as a surprise to learn that darksuckers also operate on a
celestia l scale; witness the Sun.  Our Sun makes use of dense dark,
sucking it in from all the planets and intervening dark space.  Naturally,
the Sun is better able to suck dark from the planets which are situated
closer to it, thus explaining why those planets appear brighter than do
those which are far distant from the Sun. <P>

Occasionally, the Sun actually oversucks;  under those conditions, dark
spots appear on the surface of the Sun.  Scientists have long studied
these 'sunspots' and are only recently beginni ng to realize that the dark
spots represent leaks of high pressure dark because the Sun has oversucked
dark to such an extent that some dark actually leaks back into space.
This leakage of high pressure dark frequently causes problems with radio
communic ations here on Earth due to collisions between the dark particles
as they stream out into space at high velocity via the black 'holes' in
the surface of the Sun. <P>

As with all manmade devices, darksuckers have a finite lifetime caused by
the fact that they are not 100% efficient at transmitting collected dark
back to the power company via the wires from your home, causing dark to
build up slowly within the device.  Once they are full of accumulated
dark, they can no longer suck.  This condition can be obse rved by looking
for the black spot on a full darksucker when it has reached maximum
capacity of untransmitted dark... you have surely noticed that dark
completely surrounds a full darksucker because it no longer has the
capacity to suck any dark at all. <P>

A candle is a primitive darksucker.  A new candle has a white wick.  You
will notice that after the first use the wick turns black, representing
all the dark which has been sucked into it.  If you hold a pencil next to
the wick of an operating candle, the tip will turn black because it got in
the way of the dark flowing into the candle.  It is of no use to plug a
candle into an electrical outlet;  it can only collect dark.. it has no
transmission capabilities.  Unfortunately, these primitive darksuckers h
ave a very limited range and are hazardous to operate because of the
intense heat produced. <P>

There are also portable darksuckers called flashlights.  The bulbs in
these devices collect dark which is passed to a dark storage unit called a
battery.  When th e dark storage unit is full, it must be either emptied
(a process called 'recharging') or replaced before the portable darksucker
can continue to operate.  If you break open a battery, you will find dense
black dark inside, evidence that it is actually a compact dark storage
unit.<P>

The darksuckers on your automobile are high capacity units with great
range, thus they require much larger dark storage units mounted under the
hood of the vehicle.  Since there is far more dark available in the winter
season, automobile dark storage units reach capacity more frequently than
they do in the summer, requiring 'recharging', or in severe cases, total
replacement. <P>

Dark has great mass.  When dark is drawn into a darksucker, friction
caused by the speed and mass of t he dark particles (called anti-photons)
actually generates substantial heat, thus it is unwise to touch an
operating darksucker.  Candles represent a special problem, as the dark
must travel into a solid wick instead of through clear glass.  This
generate s a great amount of heat, making it very dangerous to touch an
operating candle. <P>

Because dark has such great mass, it is very heavy.  If you swim just
below the surface of a lake, you see a lot of 'light' (absence of dark, to
be more precise).  As you go deeper and deeper beneath the surface, you
will notice that it gets darker and darker.  When you reach a depth of
approximately fifty feet, you are in total darkness.  This is because the
heavier dark sinks to the bottom of the lake, making it appear 'lighter'
near the surface. <P>

The power companies have learned to use the dark which has settled to the
bottom of lakes and rivers by pushing it through turbines, which generates
the electricity used to pump the dark toward the ocean where it may be
safely st ored for their devious purposes. <P>

Prior to the development of turbines, it was much more difficult to get
the dark from the rivers and lakes to the ocean.  The Indians recognized
this problem, and developed means to assist the flow of dark on its long
jou rney to the ocean.  When on a river in a canoe travelling in the same
direction as the flow of dark, they paddled slowly, so as not to impede
the flow of dark; but when they travelled against the flow of dark, they
paddled vigorously to help propel the da rk along its way. <P>

Scientists are working feverishly to develop exotic new instumentation
with which to measure the actual speed and energy level of dark.  While
such instumentation is beyond the capabilities of the average layman, you
can actually perfor m a test to demonstrate the unbelievable speed of
dark, right in your own home. <P>

All that is required for the simple test is a closed desk drawer situated
in a bright room.  You know from past experience that the tightly shut
drawer is FULL of dark.  Now, place your hand firmly on the drawer's
handle.  Quickly yank the drawer open.. the dark immediately disappears,
demonstrating the blinding speed with which the dark travels to the
nearest darksucker! <P>

The secrets of dark are at present known only to the power companies.
Dark must be very valuable, since they go to such lengths to collect it in
vast quantities.  By some well hidden method, more modern power
'generation' facilities have devised methods to hide their collection of
dark.  The older faciliti es, however, usually have gargantuan piles of
solidified dark in huge fenced in areas.  Visitors to these facilities are
told that the huge black piles of material are supplies of coal, but such
is not the case. <P>

The power companies have long used secret acronyms to disguise their
activities;  'D.C.' stands for 'Dark Conspiracy', while 'A.C.' is
suspected to represent the 'Alternate Conspiracy' which will most likely
be used exclusively once the secrets of D.C. are totally understood.  D.C.
is rapidly yie lding its secrets to the probing eyes and instruments of
honest scientists around the world.  The U.S. Attorney General is
considering action to be taken against the power companies for the theft
and stockpiling of dark from 'consumers'.  New developments are being
announced every day and we promise to keep the public informed of these
announcements as they occur via this newsletter.
