<H1>Astral Advertising: A Modern Occult Menace?</H1>
<H3>by Fra. Preposterous</H3>

<HR>

The Occult community is becoming increasingly divided over a
controversial
development in modern magick - Astral Advertisements. In their
recent Yuletide broadcast to all Witch Queens, Magi, &amp; Gurus,
the Secret Chiefs departed from their usual message of world peace
and harmony to urge the heads of all magical Orders to make voluntary
cutbacks in the level of astral advertising.<P>

One of our reporters interviewed a recent 'victim' of astral junk
mail; The High Priestess of the New Reformed Orthodox High Church
of Wicca (Wymeswold Branch), Marjorie Pebble.<P>

"It's awful. Why only last week we invoked the Goddess, and
instead of getting the advice I wanted to heal our Sharon's bad
knee, all I got was a repeating message to subscribe to 'Occult
News Monthly' or something. It's getting so bad that every time
I meditate I get all these jingles running through my head selling
Aeon-share holidays or ozone-friendly Demon-repellant."<P>

Last month, a public meeting of occultists at Conway Hall was
thrown into chaos when, following a Pathworking, several members
of the audience complained about seeing 359 formation-dancing
Angels advertising the new Qabalistic treatise by 'Z'em Bang Hafesh
Wang'. Visitors to Glastonbury have also reported feeling a strange
'empty' sensation when climbing the Tor, which can only be assuaged
by visiting Russell Wobble's Astral Health food and Orgone-free
Wine Bar. The problem appears to become particularly bad during
the festivals, full moons, and in the run-up to Yuletide.<P>

But some occultists, notably those in the business sector, are
fully behind astral advertising. We spoke to Angel Moonflower
of the 'Have A Nice Day' New Age Centre, Stow-on-the Wold:<P>

"Well, I prefer to think that it gives consumerism a spiritual
dimension. All our crystals have been charged with the messages
&quot;buy me&quot; and &quot;buy one more&quot;. But really, you
know you can never have too many crystals. I think that little
blue one in the corner likes you..."<P>

After a long and arduous ritual (including intermission &amp;
commercial breaks) we managed to find the inner-plane adepts masterminding
astral advertising in the UK, the shadowy A... A..., Inc. They
were out to lunch, but we left a message with the Guardian of
the Threshold. Later, in a channelled interview through their
solicitors, Shem, Ham &amp; Phorash, the A... A... said:<P>

"This is only the beginning. We can train a good neophyte
in six months to project an image &amp; soundtrack, and thanks
to the Butterfly Effect it'll stay coherent on the astral for
months. Of course, whenever someone picks receives the advert,
their contact feeds more energy into the thought-form. Our first
takers were a consortium of Chaoists doing a special offer 'try
our Chaosphere on the astral for 90 days before you buy'. Then
the OTTO hired us to project an advert of Crowley endorsing one
of his own books. Anyone doing the Gnostic Mass for the next few
months should be able to pick it up. That's the beauty of it -
not only is it cheap, but you can target your audiences. And it's
not only occultists who are taking advantage of our services.
A major soup company has offered us a substantial amount to market
'Olive Twitch's Instant Cook-in-a-Cauldron Noodles', using a dopple-ganger
of Gerald Gardner and the New Forest Coven. In the next few months
we're to begin beaming out a series of coffee ads starring several
members of the Greek Pantheon. It's amazing what some of those
old deities will do for a bit of media attention. We're particularly
pleased with the one featuring Zeus, 2 Nymphs, several goats and
a jar of Nescafe Gold Blend."<P>

"But" we said, "Isn't this getting a bit out of
hand?"<P>

"Not at all. The occult needs to move with the times, and
we're using 1% of our income to help general spiritual enlightenment
with sponsored pathworkings for minor demi-gods; posting 'Keep
the Planes Tidy' notices at all major portals, and computerising
the Akashic Records."<P>

But some traditionalists are not convinced. Hercules Wobble of
the Order of the Nine Blades; head of the Surbiton Branch of the
'Clean Up the Astral' campaign told us:<P>

"It's bloody disgraceful. Yesterday we performed a full evocation
of Asmodeus and his 99 legions for a Channel 4 Astral Broadcast
Unit, and all the little buggers turned up wearing 'Norse Gods
Comeback Tour' T-Shirts!"<P>

Despite the controversy, it looks as though Astral Advertising
is here to stay. Since we complained on behalf of suffering readers,
the A... A... have generously offered a simple astral 'noise filter'
meditation. It costs a mere &#163;500 and is available from Mammon
Investments direct. Simply visualise the A... A... logo - a dollar
sign inside a triangle, and, on hearing the astral bell, simply
chant your name, address, and Karmacard number.<P>
