<H1>Heretic's Christmas Carol</H1>

<HR>

God rest ye merry Pagan folk,<BR>
 Let nothing you dismay.<BR>
Remember there's no evidence<BR>
 There was a Christmas Day.<BR>
When Christ was born is just not known,<BR>
 No matter what they say.<P>

Glad tidings of logic & fact;<BR>
 Logic & fact.<BR>
Glad tidings of logic & fact.<P>

There was no star of Bethlehem;<BR>
 There was no angel song.<BR>
There could have been no Wise Men<BR>
 For the journey was too long.<BR>
The stories in the Bible<BR>
 Are historically wrong.<P>

Glad tidings of logic & fact;<BR>
 Logic & fact.<BR>
Glad tidings of logic & fact.<P>

Much of your Christmas customs<BR>
 Come from Persia and from Greece,<BR>
From solstice celebrations<BR>
 Of the ancient Middle East.<BR>
We know this so-called "Holy Day"<BR>
 Is but a Pagan feast<P>

Glad tidings of logic & fact;<BR>
 Logic & fact<BR>
Glad tidings of logic & fact.<P>
