<H1>Crowley</H1>
<H3>by Frater In Profunda</H3>

<P><HR><P>

I met him on the beach down at Cefalu,<BR>
Where he sunbathed all the time<BR>
while he dictated his whole life's story.<BR>
Very drolly, stor, stor, stor, stor, story.<BR>
I saw this bald guy sitting there on a rock,<BR>
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said, 'Crowley.'<BR>
Just like 'Holy', Crowley, Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<P>

Well, I've been around but I ain't never seen<BR>
A guy who says he's a Magus and then writes sonnets obscene.<BR>
Oh my Crowley,  Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<BR>
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand<BR>
How he can make me a camel just by raising his hand.<BR>
Oh my Crowley,  Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<BR>
Crowley,  Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<P>

Well, I left home just a week before,<BR>
And I've never ever been a Templar before,<BR>
But Cap'n Fuller sent me straight to Al,<BR>
He said, 'Go to Crowley and he'll give you the Law!'<BR>
Well, I'm not the kind that would argue with John,<BR>
So I packed my bags for the Mediterranean.<BR>
To see Crowley, Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<BR>
Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley, <BR>
Crowley, Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<BR>
Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<P>

So I signed the Pledge.<BR>
I sat in Asana,<BR>
Assumed the God-form,<BR>
While I did Liber Resh.<BR>
Well, I won't forget what Crowley said:<BR>
He said, 'Vic, stay away from the Left-Hand Path,<BR>
And if you shut yourself up, then Our Lady will laugh.'<BR>
Oh my Crowley,  Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<BR>
'I know my Qabalah's really got you perplexed,<BR>
But remember things must add up or you'll really be vexed!'<BR>
Oh my Crowley,  Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<P>

Well, I heard Mussollini got in a snit,<BR>
So we're headed off for Tunisia, I guess.<BR>
But I know that I'll be with Crowley for years,<BR>
I'll be paying his way through this veil of tears.<BR>?
The long-term Pledge-form I had to sign<BR>
Says I'll be buying his books 'til the end of time,<BR>
Books by Crowley, Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.<BR>
Cro, Cro, Cro, Cro, Crowley.
