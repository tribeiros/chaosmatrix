Hey, girls! Are you tired of the same old careers packages for your
favourite anorexic role model? Well, guess what! <P>

Mattel introduces:<P>

<PRE>
<CENTER>h e r m e t i c  b a r b i e<P></CENTER>

Now you and Barbie can share in the mysteries of ceremonial magick!
Rituals are so much more fun with Barbie's personal tarot deck that
turns into a barrette you can wear yourself! And you'll love her
robes, embroidered with esoteric symbols in trendy fashion colours!<P>

But wait! There's more! Not only does your poseable playmate come
complete with a trendy wand, a fashionable chart of the Kabalah that
will look precious on your locker door, and a change of shoes;
if you act now and collect valuable Qlippoth points, you can send
them in and get Barbie's very own Minerval initiation kit!*
You'll get the Ordo Templi Orientis newsletter, stickers, a dazzling
membership card, and a SURPRISE BONUS!!<P>

And, for those Dream IX&deg; Operation parties, there's Dream IX&deg; Ken!!
Dream IX&deg; Ken is the first Mattel doll to come with his very own Wand
Of Will! <P>

Don't settle for those fluffy-bunny Pagan knockoffs!! Why bother with a
Disney's Pocohontas doll when you can explore the mysteries of the Western
occult tradition with America's favourite Scarlet Woman?<P>

<PRE>h e r m e t i c  b a r b i e -- new from Mattel!!</PRE><P>

*Please enclose $77.70 for postage, handling, and legal fees against
Kenneth Grant.<P>

   It's getting so that you can't throw a neopagan without hitting
 seventeen others who have ALL past life regressed to being toasted.
