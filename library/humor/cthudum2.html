Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to you about a matter of great importance to our company,
namely, the protection of our intellectual property.  We would
appreciate it if you would review this letter and respond by June 1,
1998.

As you may know, IDG Books Worldwide ("IDGB") publishes and distributes
globally a line of reference books known as the "...For Dummies(R)"
series.  The "...For Dummies(R)" series has been in existence since
November 1991 and has enjoyed unprecedented success.  In fact, there are
over 50 million "...For Dummies(R)" books in print and the books have
been translated into 38 languages.  The "...For Dummies(R)" series
includes, among many other titles, Windows(R) For Dummies(R), The
Internet For Dummies(R), Politics For Dummies(R), Personal Finance For
Dummies(R), and Fitness For Dummies(R).  IDGB also licenses and
distributes numerous line extensions and ancillary products based on the
"...For Dummies(R)" series, including musical CDs, clothing, toys, and
calendars.

The "...For Dummies(R)" series is immediately recognizable by, among
other things, the trademark "...For Dummies(R)."  The "...For
Dummies(R)" trademark appears not only on the books themselves but also
on trade and consumer advertising, in catalogs, on point of sale
displays, on giveaway items, on IDGB's Web site, and on other
promotional material distributed around the world.  IDGB has made a
considerable investment in promoting the identification of its "...For
Dummies(R)" trademark to its distributors and customers.  As a result,
and as evidenced by the many articles written and comments received from
distributors, customers, and the press, it is clear that IDGB's "...For
Dummies(R)" trademark is widely identified with IDGB.  In short, this
trademark is an extremely valuable asset of IDGB.

It has come to our attention that you have published an article on the
www.sonic.net Web site (specifically,
http://www.sonic.net/fenwick/chaos/cthudum.html) entitled "Cthulu for
Dummies."  Unfortunately, this title uses and infringes IDGB's federally
registered "...For Dummies(R)" trademark.  In addition, it is highly
likely that visitors could be misled into believing that this article
was authorized by or is associated with IDGB.

We hope that this matter can be resolved quickly and amicably.
Accordingly, we request that you remove the infringing material from the
Web page and anywhere else it appears and provide IDGB with your written
assurances that you will refrain from infringing its trademarks.  Please
be advised that if this matter cannot be immediately resolved, IDGB is
fully prepared to enforce its rights.  We look forward to hearing from
you on or before June 1, 1998.

Sincerely,

Terri Morgan
