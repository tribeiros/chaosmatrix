      came, and they built their own places. Most of them were Cyclopean cities,
      raised by Ye Old Ones or destroyed by Them. Made of black obsidian and
      ever strong basalt, they were built to ye image of their Makers : huge
      alleys where They can Walk on Winds, countless pillars and towers rising
      to ye skies like filthy claws, shiny domes and crystal windows, from where
      they could watch ye Stars They Came From.

      beneath ye Eastern Ocean, close to ye lost continent of Mu. His son
      Ghatanothoa lays within ye mountain of Mu. His second son, Ythogtha, was
      imprisoned in a chasm in Yhe, a Muvian province. Zoth-Ommog lay chained
      beneath ye ocean off ye "Island of ye Sacred Stone Cities." Ubbo-Sathla,
      ye source and ye end lay confined forever at ye subterranean place
      referred to only as "gray-litten Y'qaa, beneath ancient <A

      <P>These are not empty places however. Servents and minions still lurk in
      ye dark corners of titanic streets. In addition to ye dangers of such
      journey, ye Traveller shall be prepared to face ye Ones who still worship
      Them in ye Dark. With much wisdom and mastery of the Art of Arcanes, ye
      Traveller may find there artefacts and allies to start an even more
      dangerous journey ; the very path of ye <A
