      <P><I><IMG align=left alt=C src="img/cap_c.jpg">oncerning the Old
      Ones, it is written, they wait ever at the Gate. and the Gate is all
      places at all times, for They know nothing of time or place but are in all
      time and in all place together without appearing to be, and there are
      those amongst Them which can assume diverse Shapes and Features and any
      given Shape and any given Face and the Gates are for Them everywhere, but
      the first. was that which I caused to be opened, namely in Irem, the City
      of Pillars, the City under the Desert, but wherever men sayeth the
      forbidden Words, they shall cause there a Gate to be established and shall
      wait upon Them Who Come through the Gate, even as the Dhols, and the
      Abominable Mi-Go, and the Tcho-Tcho people, and the Deep Ones, and the
      Gugs, and the Gaunts of the Night and the Shoggoths and the Voormis, and
      the Shantaks which guard Kadath in the Cold Waste and the Plateau of Leng.
      All are alike the Children of the Elder Gods, but the Great Race of Yith
      and the Great Old Ones failing to agree, one with another, and both with
      the Elder Gods, seperated, leaving the Great Old Ones in possession of the
      Earth, while the Great Race, returning from Yith took up Their Abode
      forward in Time in Earth-Land not yet known to those who walk the Earth
      today, and there wait till there shall come again the winds and the Voices
      which drove Them forth before and That which Walketh on the Winds over the
      Earth and in the spaces that are among the Stars forever. </I><BR
