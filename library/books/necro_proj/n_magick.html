      <P>Fools indeed are those Sorcerers who, intoxicat'd with their own fame
      and justify'd of theri own Powers, do lay hold on ye Old Ones as if they
      be mere Daemons, and seek to conjure and hold such by ye Cantrip, ye
      Spell, and ye Five-Pointed Star.
      <P>For Daemons do verily obey these things, but ye Old Ones be far more
      than Daemons, and hold all magick of Earth as vain and powerless and all
      Sorcerers of Earth as children pretend'ng to command ye Wind whither it
      blows. Ye most potent wizard Ibn Al-Kadil did in my presence try his rule
      over one Old One, a creature of most surprising habits and unpleasant
      attitude whose name was called Y------c, who was but a shadow of dread
      CTHULHU in both power and awfulness. Said Ibn Al-Kadil, that to but read
      ye name of Y------c was to ensure its coming, and to say the name aloud
      was certain disaster. Thus Ibn Al-Kadil had fortify'd himself with ye most
      terrible collection of potions, talismans, and binding spells known to
      magicians of this astral plane before ye invocation was ever made.
      <P>Alas, Y------c did not wait on ye invocation, but did appear early, and
      all that was left of ye most potent wizard Ibn Al-Kadil was his pile of
      protective trinkets. These Y------c did throw at my feet most disdainfully
      before vanishing as quickly as it came.
      <P>So it is that I tell you of a truth that ye Old Ones obey not their
      summoners, but disdain them; and that for some of Them a passing thought
      is as an open Gate.
