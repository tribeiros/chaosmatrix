      <P><I><IMG align=left alt=W src="img/cap_w.jpg">here the dark is
      blacker than black and a color of its own, where nothing is something, and
      the dark is yet clearer than light, it was. It had always been there; It
      thought at those times when it was able to think at all, those short
      periods of consciousness between eternally seeming periods of what could
      only be sleep or nonexistence, and maybe It died each time and was reborn,
      if It could die at all, which It didn't know either. Then It tried to
      think of Itself, and It knew It had a name, which was Cyaegha, which told
      It nothing about Itself except that It did exist. It just was, It couldn't
      be touched in Its somewhere place which was nowhere, but neither could It
      touch other things.
      <P>It could be called evil, if evil would have had a rational meaning to
      Itys existence, which it hadn't. Rather Cyaegha was something beyond the
      man-made laws of good and evil, a natural force, or a natural happening
      like a wood-fire or a tornado, or a storm, or just plain death, something
      to which no artificial laws apply.
      <P>Sometimes during those scarce moments when It was allowed to think, or
      maybe allowed Itself to think, because It didn't know if the sleep-death
      periods were or weren't created by Itself, It tried to remember more than
      Its name. Then there came sights of millenia of blue ice and then of
      fire-spitting volcanoes, warts on the face of Earth, and it all seemed so
      utterly stupid and unimportant to Cyaegha that it revolted It, so It went
      back to death and slumber. Time had no real meaning either, it was just
      something which went by unnoticed, utterly unimportant to something such
      as Cyaegha, trapped in Its maybe self- made prison and only by Its mind in
      contact with the outer reality. And at those times when It was awake,
      fully awake, It hated, as only something can hate which is beyond good and
      evil. Its whole consciousness became that hate, because that was the only
      thing It could do. It saw with eyes that were no eyes, and It heard with
      ears that were not ears, and It thought with Its whole being because It
      didn't possess such primitive organs as brains either. Silently It hated.
      <P>Through the aeons some of Its alien dreams touched men and drove them
      gibbering mad. Some were more strongly protected and just felt the outer
      touches of Its dreams, and tried to interpret then consciously in essays,
      or used them unconsciously in weird stories. Some authors wrote them down
      as stories, knowing that the world would never accept such an utterly
      alien reality. Of course they too were considered as insane, as those who
      really had been driven mad by Its dreams. None had the knowledge and the
      possibilities to search for other clues. Because Its name had already been
      written down long ago, or other names which they thought was Its, carved
      on limestone tablets; and Its shape had been painted on the walls of
      subterreanian caves, still waiting to be opened. But Its shape was not
      real and constantly changed, and later they wrote about It with trembling
      fingers on ancient scrolls, and still later on parchments, and all were
      burned when they were discovered. And when some dared to print Its name,
      the writers and printers were burned together with their books. But some
      always survived, some always stayed sane or at least partly, and
      interpreted Its dreams. Some prayed to It, offering It still warm, beating
      hearts torn out of the bleeding chests of sacrificial victims, and still
      others cursed It in many languages, but It couldn't care less. It didn't
      hate then more or less for what they did. It hated then all with Its whole
      being.
      <P>And sometimes Cyaegha dreamed too, dreamed of the others, just like
      Itself, and yet so different, as ancient as Itself and as hidden as
      Itself, by aeons of nameless terror. And It wondered where they were.
      <P>In hiding, or chained,as Itself? Waiting...always waiting.
      <P>Hating...always hating. And the Dark That Waits has 5 who guard the
      temple and the Dark,and they are called Vaeyen. They are The Black Light,
      the White Fire which is Blacker than Night, the White Dark which is more
      red than the Fire, the Winged Woman, and the Green Moon, Who keep and
      guard Him in His Darkness.
      <P>The Nagaäe that serve Cyaegha are earth creatures with toadlike bodies,
      transparent, with pulsating innards covered only by a thin layer of
      leathery skin. They have the hind legs of a frog, and the forelegs of a
      man. They moves crablike, crawling on their lumpy bellies, and pushing
      with the force of their hind legs, giving themselves direction by muscular
      movements of their bellies. All four of each one's forelegs are raised
      mantislike. Their faces consist mainly of bulging eyes and an oversized
      mouth with two forked tongues. </I>
