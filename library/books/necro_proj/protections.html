      <P><I><IMG align=left alt=M src="img/cap_m.jpg">y protection
      seems to be holding, but for how long I can only guess ... the Elder Sign
      has taken much abuse ... Before I leave this "sanctuary" let me describe
      what I perceive to be some effective defenses against the agents of
      humanity ...
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=+2>The Elder Sign</FONT> -- imprinted with a
      sign of power and blessed by the priests of the Elder Gods. They CAN NOT
      not be duplicated (Lord knows we tried -- with disasterous results). Size
      has no bearing on the power of the sign .. I have seen signs both large
      and small ...
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=+2>Rock Salt</FONT> -- used to replace
      buckshot, this is effective against Shuggoths, the Ancient Race, and the
      Yuggoth Fungi. You must get close for the shot to puncture their "flesh"
      ... too close ...
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=+2>The Chaos Shield</FONT> -- this device is a
      small buckler with the eight arrows of Chaos imprinted on the front.
      Michael Moorcock wrote of the device after a dream and incorporated it
      into his "Elric" stories. The device exists ... it was last seen near
      Greenland ... it offers immunity from physical attacks from outer world
      beings.
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=+2>Explosives</FONT> -- the Deep Ones can be
      damaged by normal physical means. Explosives seem to do the most damage.
      Fire unfortunately does not seem to hurt them as much as we would have
      thought ... must be the skin ...
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=+2>Fire</FONT> -- Man's first defense since
      elder times. There's NO guarentee that ancient / elder outer world
      creatures are succeptable to fire attacks. It never hurts to carry some
      oil and a dependable light ...
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=+2>Silver</FONT> -- When used as a head dress
      (woven into a hood, cap, etc...) prevents most baneful creatures from
      harming your mind (or reading your thoughts). This information came from
      other sources that haven't been disproved (yet), ... it saved my life once
      ...
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=+2>Mirror</FONT> -- Most intelligence
      creatures ignore the mirror ... works to distract the stupider creatures
      ...
      <P><FONT color=#701010 size=+2>Black powder</FONT> -- effective means of
      stopping the Shuggoths from smelling / tracking you ... works well on
      other creatures ...
      <P>I must leave now ... supplies are low ... time is short ... till next
      time ... </I>
