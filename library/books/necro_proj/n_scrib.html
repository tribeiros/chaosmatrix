      <P><IMG align=left alt=T src="img/cap_t.jpg"> <I>o be a black
      magician is perhaps ye most dangerous thing one can attempt, for you risk
      not only your life and mind but your essence -- what simpler minds call ye
      "soul" -- as well. You may beat ye odds and become a god, but most likely
      you will go mad.
      <P>Or -- and this may be worst of all -- you may do both.
      <P>Oh thou who wrote of evil things remember : they always are inspired by
      Ye Evil Ones you shall meet after your passing, so turn your dark thoughts
      to repentment and prayer since ye road to Hell is much shorter than what
      you believe : do not let you wicked soul to become as dark as this page.
      <P>We hunt a horror that feeds on human tears . . .
      <P>After the western horizon's blood turns black, and all through the
      dusky hours, I, in my solitude, roam the far flung realms of time. In
      ancient halls with brazen censers smoldering, strange shadows dance across
      vaulted ceilings and curtains of rich velvet. And those stone chambers
      ring with echoes of the twisted language of conjuration, lighted by the
      glow of otherworldly powers. The walls meet at impossible angles and there
      tread unearthly fiends that are deranged nightmares come to life. Frozen
      by fear, I remain unseen. And ere a tint of rose in the east heralds the
      coming dawn I am released from my nocturnal wanderings and am allowed to
      return from whence I came beyond the wall of sleep. Only then do all those
      things vanish and be gone with the morning mist until my awakening once
      again gives them life.
      <P>While traveling from island to island, I heard many tales of ancient
      and forgotten lore. Although I dismissed many of these stories as
      nonsensical superstitions, I found ye tale of Orobla singularly
      significant. It evoked half remembered feelings that I had not felt since
      I had slept in ye ancient city of many pillared Irem.
      <P>Hearken unto ye incessant prattle that constantly spewed forth from ye
      many mouths of Orobla, ye Beast of ye forgotten lies,
      <P>"Does ye horrid face of Boac-Treth tolerate frail human cowardice? You
      know that it can not. Such is its nature. So why, I say again unto you,
      why do you not arise and strike down ye blasphemers who would deny ye
      ultimate truth? You know your cowardice will not be tolerated. Ye wrath of
      ye Old Ones will surely fall upon you all! Do you not feel ye dreams of ye
      one who sleeps beneath ye waves? Do you hope that he will be pleased by
      your pathetic nature when his harsh gaze falls upon you? No. Surely, he
      shall devour you with all of ye others who have forgotten ye way! How can
      you continue to behave in such a frail and inconstant manner when all of
      you have seen ye wondorus lens of ye moon and ye crucible of eternal
      vitae? You puny beings are as worthless as so much excrement. I will laugh
      with joy when Yog-Sothoth and his favored son appear. They together shall
      set aright all that has been mislaid. I shall dance upon many legs when ye
      cloven feet of ye Goat with a Thousand Young pounds ye infidels back into
      ye dust from which they arose. I will be as one with ye dark minion
      himself, ye one who walks abroad in ye form of a man, but is not a man. I
      speak of he whose faces are as numerous as there are stars in ye heavens.
      His vicous rage needs not be mentioned for his way is known to all men.
      You should fear evoking his wrath for he is ye left hand of ye center, ye
      voice of ye ultimate destruction."
      <P>Such was ye way that Orobla would speak. It had expounded in this
      incessant manner for hours and days and years unnumbered, always cursing
      ye reticent nature of its many followers. Until that fortold day when ye
      moon was as crimson and flaming steel fell from ye stars. Upon that very
      day, when ye ruddy sphere hung at its apex like a severed head, ye Beast
      of forgotten lies was silent. Orobla has not uttered a sound since. His
      priests,who hide amongst ye men and women of Crete, reverently proclaim
      that when Orobla speaks again ye world shall be undone. They claim that
      R'leyh shall be hurled into ye sky and Cthulhu and his kind shall be freed
      to rule once again.
      <P>I know not if I should believe all of ye strange tales they told me,
      but ye previous legend was told with such conviction that I felt compelled
      to record it. </I>

      <P>Through the ages I have lived, secluded under the impass- able
      mountains of the unknown Kaddath, but now having dis- pelled the arcane
      powers that kept me imprisioned, I have returned, and I am here to wreak
      fiery death and chaos upon your lowly race. Behold the Power of Axn-Xcamr

      <P>Nay! Dead Cthulhu lies not dreaming, rather, listen to the rhythm of
      the waves, for they tell the fell story of a noisome day to come, when
      Cthulhu shall spew forth from dead R'Lyeh to lead his minions on a rampage
      of slaughter throughout the unsuspecting world.... <BR>I can no longer
      tolerate the slap slapping of the sea, for I hear the cries, feel the
      vibrations......waving tentacles deep down pound out an ancient rhythm,
      hordes of batrachian mouths gibber fiendishly....oh that I would never see
      the ocean again!!! Ia! Ia! Shib Niggurath save me! The goat with 1000
      young have mercy.....nay, evn as I grovel on the floor of this rented
      tenement, I feel the walls close in about me..... is it? could it be? I
      hear them....the Hounds....the Hounds come and I am doomed... Mna
      'Fth'ngui Fgthan......
      <P>Humans are such foolish creatures.... They know not of the Dark, of the
      Things Within, of Nyarlathotep, Cthulhu, or Shub-Niggaroth.
      <P>Few of the foolish creatures, Bolder, if less sane than the rest,
      Choose to learn, to understand. To find the secrets of the Night, to learn
      that which none should know.

      <P>There will come a day when they will walk amongst you. They will not be
      able to be seen for what they are by normal folk. Only those amonst you
      with true faith will be able to detect their evil and be able to stop
      them. <BR>Do not fail as the fate of the world rests in your hands and as
      such, if you fail, the human race is doomed.
