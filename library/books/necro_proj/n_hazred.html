      <P><IMG align=left alt=T src="img/cap_t.jpg"> <I>his is the
      testimony of all that I have seen, and all that I have learned, in those
      years that I have possesed the Three Seals of MASSHU. I have seen One
      Thousand and-One moons, and surely this is enough for the span of a mans
      life, though it is said the Prophets lived much longer. I am weak, and
      ill, and bear great tired- ness and exaustion, and a sigh hangs in my
      breast like a dark lantern, I am old.
      <P>The wolves carry thier name in thier midnight speeches, and that quiet,
      subtle Voice is summoning me from afar. And a voice much closer will shout
      into my ear with unholy impatience. The weight of my soul will decide its
      final resting place. Before the time, I must put down here all that I can
      concerning the horrors that stalk Without, and which lie in wait at the
      door of every man, for this is the ancient arcana that has been handed
      down of old, but which has been forgotten by all but a few men, the
      worshippers of the Ancient Ones (may thier names be blotted out!)
      <P>And if I do not finish this task, take what is here and discover the
      rest, for time is short and mankind does not know or understand the evil
      that awaits it, from every side, from every open Gate, from every broken
      barrier, from every mindless acolyte at the alters of madness.
      <P>For this is the Book of the Dead, the Book of the Black Earth, that I
      have writ down at the peril of my life, exactly as I recieved it, on the
      planes of IGIGI, the cruel celestial spirits from beyond the Wanderers of
      the Wastes.
      <P>Let all who read this book be warned thereby that the habitation of men
      are seen and surveyed by that Ancient Race of gods and demons from a time
      before time, and that they seek revenge for that forgotten battle that
      took place somewhere in the Cosmos and rent the Worlds in the days before
      the creation of Man, when the Elder Gods walked the Spaces, the race of
      MARDUK, as he is known to the Chaldeans, and of ENKI our master, the Lord
      of Magicians.
      <P>Know, then, that I have trod all the Zones of the Gods, and also the
      places of Azonei, and have descended into the foul places of Death and
      Eternal Thirst, which may be reached through the Gate of GANZIR, which was
      built in UR in the days before Babylonian was.
      <P>Know, too, that I have spoken with all manner of spirit and daemon,
      whose names are no longer known in the societies of Man, or were never
      known. And the seals of these are writ herein ; yet others I must take
      with me when I leave you. ANU have mercy on my soul!
      <P>I have seen the Unknown Lands, that no map has ever charted. I have
      lived in the deserts and the wastelands, and spoken with demons and the
      souls of slaughtered men, and of women who have died in childbirth,
      victims of the she-fiend LAMMASHTA.
      <P>I have traveled beneath the Seas, in search of the Palace of Our
      Master, and found the stone monuments of vanquished civilizations, and de-
      ciphered the writings of some of these; while still others remain
      mysteries to any man who lives. And these civilizations were destroyed
      because of the knoeledge contained in this book.
      <P>I have traveled among the stars, and trembled before the gods. I have
      at last found the formula by which I passed the gate of ARZIR, and passed
      into the forbidden realms ofthe foul IGIGI.
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG hspace=10 src="img/fig_demon.jpg"
      vspace=10></CENTER>
      <P>I have raised demons, and the dead.
      <P>I have summoned the ghosts of my ancestors to real and visible
      appearence on the tops of temples built to reach the stars, and built to
      touch the nethermost cavities of HADES. I have wrestled with the Black
      Magician, AZAG-THOTH, in vain, and fled to the Earth by calling upon
      INANNA and her brother MARDUK, Lord of the double-headed AXE.
      <P>I have raised armiesagainst the Lands of the East, by summoning the
      hordes of fiends I have made subject unto me, and so doing found NGAA, the
      god of the heathens, who breathes flame and roares like a thousand
      thunders.
      <P>I have found fear.
      <P>I have found the Gate that leads to the Outside, by which the Ancient
      Ones, who ever seek the entrance to our world, keep eternal watch. I have
      smelled the vapors of that Ancient One, Queen of the Outside, whose name
      is writ in the MAGAN text, the testiment of some dead civilization whose
      priests, seeking power, swing open the dread, evil Gate for an hour past
      the time and were consumed.
      <P>I came to possess this knowledge through circumstances quite peculiar,
      while still the unlettered son of a shepherd in what is called Mesopotamia
      by the Greeks.
      <P>When I was only a youth, traveling alone in the mountains to the East,
      called MASSHU by the people who live there, I came upon a grey rock carved
      with three strange symbols. It stood as high as a man, and as wide around
      as a bull. It was firmly in the ground, and I could not move it. Thinking
      no more of the carvings, save that they might be the work of a king to
      mark some Ancient victory over an enemy, I built a fire at its foot to
      protect me from the from the wolves that wander in that reigons and went
      to sleep, for it was night and I was far from my village, being Bet
      Durrabia. Bieng about three hours from dawn, in the nineteenth of Shabatu,
      I was awakened by the howl of a dog, or perhaps a wolf, uncommonly loud
      and close at hand. The fire had died to its embers, and these red, glowing
      coals cast a faint, dancing shadow across the stone monument with the
      three carvings. I began to make haste to build another fire when, at once,
      the grey rock began to rise slowly into the air, as if it were a dove. I
      could not move or speak for the fear that siezed upon my spine and wrapped
      cold fingers around my skull. The Dik of Azug-bel-ya was no stranger
      seemed to melt into my hands!
      <P>Presently, I heard a voice, softly, some distance away and a more
      practical fear, that the possibility of robbers, took hold of me and I
      rolled behind weeds, trembling. Another voice joined the first, and soon
      several men in black robes of thieves came together over the place where I
      was, surroundin the floating rock, of which they did not exhibit in the
      least fright.
      <P>I could see clearly now that the three carvings on the stone monument
      were glowing, a flame red color, as through the rock were on fire. The
      figures were murmuring together in prayer or invocation, of which only a
      few words could be heard, and these in some unknown tongue; though, ANU
      have mercy on my soul!, these rituals are not unknown to me any longer.
      <P>The figures, whose faces I could not see or recognize, began to make
      wild passes in the air with knives that glinted cold and sharp in the
      mountain night.
      <P>From beneath the floating rock, out of the very ground where it had
      sat, came rising the tail of a serpent. This serpent was surely larger
      than any I had ever seen. The thinnest section thereof was fully that of
      the arms of two men, and as it rose from the earth it was followed by
      another, although the end of the first was not seen as it seemed to reach
      down into the very Pit itself. These were followed by still more, and the
      ground began to tremble under the pressure of so many of these enormous
      arms. The chanting of the priests, for I knew them now to be some the
      servents ofsome hidden Power, became much louder and nearly hysterical.
      <P>IA! IA! ZI AZAG! <BR>IA!IA! ZI AZKAK! <BR>IA! IA! KUTULU ZI KUR!
      <BR>IA!
      <P>The ground where I was hiding became wet with some substance, being
      slightly downhill from the scene I was witnessing. I touched the wetness
      and found it to be blood. In horror I screamed and gave my presence away
      to the priests. They turned toward me, and I saw with loathing that they
      had cut their chests with the daggers they had used to raise the stone,
      for some mystical purpose I could not then divine; although I now know
      that blood is the very food of these spirits, which is why tha field after
      the battles of war glows with an unnatural light, the manifestation of the
      spirits feeding thereon.
      <P>May ANU protect us all!
      <P>My scream had the effect of casting thier ritual into chaos and
      disorder. I raced through the mountain path by which I had come, and the
      priests came running after me, although some seemed to stay behind,
      perhaps to finish the Rites. However, as I ran wildly down the slopes in
      the cold night, my heart gave rise in my chest and my head growing hot,
      the sound of splitting rocks and thunder came from behind me and shook the
      very ground I ran on. In fright and haste I fell to the earth.
      <P>Rising, I turned to face whatever attackerhad come nearest me, though I
      was unarmed. To my surprise, what I saw was no priest of ancient horror,
      no necromancer of that forbidden Art, but black robes fallen upon the
      grass and weeds, with no seeming presance of life or bodies beneath them.
      <P>I walked cautiously to the first and, picking up a long twig, lifted
      the robe from the tangle of weeds and thorns. All that remained of the
      priest was a pool of slime, like green oil, and the smell of a body lain
      long in the sun to rot. Such a stench nearly overpowered me, but I was
      resolute to find the others, to see if the same fortune had also befallen
      them.
      <P>Walking back up the slope that I had so fearfully run down only moments
      ago, I came across yet another of the black priests, in identical
      condition to the first. I kept walking, passing more of the robes as I
      went, not venturing to overturn them any longer. Then, I finally came upon
      the grey stone monument that had risen unnaturally into the air at the
      command of the priests. It was now upon the ground once more, but the
      carvings still glowed with supernatural light. The serpents, or what I had
      then thought of as serpents, had disappeared. But in the dead embers of
      the fire, now cold and black, was a shining metal plate. I picked it up
      and saw that it was also carved, as the stone, but very intricatly, after
      a fasion I could not understand. It did not bear the same markings as the
      stone, but I had the feeling I coukd almost read the characters, but could
      not, as though I once knew the tongue but had since long forgotten. Mt
      head began to ache as though a devil was pounding my skull, when a shaft
      of moonlight hit the metal amulet, for I know now what it was, and a voice
      entered my head and told me the secrets of the scene I had witnessed in
      one word:
      <P>KUTULU.
      <P>In that moment, as though whispered fiercly into my ear, I understood.
      <P>These were the signs carved upon the grey stone, that was the gate to
      the Outside:
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG src="img/!necro422.gif"> </CENTER>
      <P>
      <P>The amulet that I held in my hand, and hold to this very day, around my
      neck as I write these words, is this:
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG src="img/!necro41.gif"></CENTER>
      <P>Of the three symbols carved, the first is the Sign of our Race from
      beyond the Stars, and is called ARRA in the tongue of the Scribe who
      taught it to me, an emissary of the Elder Ones. In the tongue of the
      eldest city of Babylon, it was UR. It is the Sigil of the Covenant of the
      Elder Gods, and when they see it, they who gave it to us, they will not
      forget us. They have sworn!
      <P>Spirit of the Skies, Remember!
      <P>The second sign is the Elder Sign, and is the Key whereby the Powers of
      the Elder Gods may be summoned, when used with the proper words and
      shapes. It has a Name, and is called AGGA.
      <P>The third sign is the Sigil of the Watcher. It is called BANDAR. The
      Watcher is a Race sent by the Elder Ones. It keeps vigil while one sleeps
      provided the appropriate rituals and sacrifice has been preformed; else,
      if called, it will turn upon you.
      <P>These seals, to be effective, must be graven on stoneand set in the
      ground. Or, set upon the alter of offerings. Or, carried to the Rock of
      Invocations. Or, engraved upon the metal of ones God or Goddes and hung
      about the neck, but hidden from the view of the profane. Of these three,
      the ARRA and the AGGA may be used seperatly, that is to say singly, and
      alone. The BANDAR however, must never be used alone, but with one or both
      of the others, for the Watcher must needs to be reminded of the Covenant
      he has sworn with the Elder Gods and our Race, else it will turn upon thee
      and slay thee and ravage thy town untill succour is to be had from the
      Elder Gods by the tears of thy people and the wailing of thy women.
      <P>KAKAMMU!
      <P>The fire amulet that I retrieved from the ashes of the fire, and which
      caught the light of the moon, is a potent seal against whatever may come
      in the Gate from the Outside for, seeing it, they willretreat from thee
      SAVE ONLY IF IT CATCH THE LIGHT OF THE MOON UPON ITS SURFACE for, in the
      dark days of the moon, or in clouds, there can be little protection
      against the fiends from the Ancient Land should they break the barrier, or
      be let in by thier servants upon the face of the Earth. In such a case, no
      recourse is to be had untill the light of the moon shines upon the Earth,
      for the moon is the Eldest among the Zonei, and is the starry symbol of
      our pact. NANNA, Father of the Gods, Remember!
      <P>Wherefore, the amulet must be engraved upon pure silver in the full
      light of the moon, that the moon shine upon it at its working, and the
      essence of the moon be drawn down and captured therein. And the proper
      incantations must be performed, and the prescribed rituals as given forth
      in this Book. And the amulet must NEVER be exposed to the light of the
      Sun, for SHAMMASH called UDU, in his jealousy, will rob the seal of its
      power. In such case, it must be bathed in waters of camphor, and the
      incantations and ritual performed once again. But verily, it were better
      to engrave another.
      <P>These secrets I give to thee at the pain of my life, never to be
      revealed to the profane, or the banished, or the Worshippers of the
      Ancient Serpent, but to keep within thine own heart, always silent upon
      these things.
      <P>Peace be to thee!
      <P>Henceforth, from that fateful night in the mountains of MASSHU, I
      wandered about the countryside in search of the key to the secret
      knowledge that had been given me. And it was a painful and lonley journey,
      during which time I took no wife, called no house or village my home, and
      dwelt in variuos countries, often in caves or in the deserts, lerning
      several tongues as a traveler, to bargin with the tradespeople and learn
      of the news and customs. But my bargining was with the Powers that reside
      in each of these countries. And soon, I came to understand many things of
      which before I had no knowledge, except perhaps in dreams. The friends of
      my youth deserted me, and I them. When I was seven years gone from my
      family, I learned that they had all died of thier own hand, for reasons no
      one was able to tell me; thier flocks had later been slain as the victoms
      of some strange epidemic.
      <P>I wandered as a begger, being fed from town to town as the local people
      saw fit, often being stoned instead of threatened with imprisonment. On
      occasion, I was able to convince some learned man that I was a sincere
      scholar, and was thereby permitted to read the Ancient Records in which
      the details of necromancy, sorcery, magick and alchemy are given. I
      learned of the spells that cause men illness, the plague, blindness,
      insanity and even death. I learned the various classes of demons and evil
      gods that exist, and of the old legends concerning the Ancient Ones. I was
      thus able to arm myself against the dread Maskim, who lie in wait about
      the boundaries of the world, ready to trap the unwary and devour the
      sacrifices set out at night and in deserted places; against the she-devil
      LAMMASHTA, who is called Sword that Splits the Skull, the sight of whom
      causes horror and dismay, and (some say) death of a most uncommon nature.
      <P>In time I learned of the names and properties of all the demons,
      devils, fiends and monsters listed herein, in this Book of the Black
      Earth. I learned of the powers in the astral Gods, and how to summon thier
      aid in times of need. I learned, too, of the frightful beings who dwell
      beyond the astral spirits, who guard the entrance to the Temple of the
      Lost, of the Ancient Days the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, whose Name I
      connot write here.
      <P>In my solitary ceremonies in the hills, worshipping with fire and
      sword, with water and dagger, and with the assistance of strange grass
      that grows wild in certain parts of the MASSHU, and with which I had
      unwittingly built my fire before the rock, that grass that gives the mind
      great power to travel termendous distances into the heavens, as also into
      the hells, I recieved the formulae for the amulets and talismans which
      follow, which provide the Priest with safe passage among the spheres
      wherein he may travel in search of the Wisdom.
      <P>But now, after One Thousand-and-One moons of the journey, the Maskim
      nip at my heels, the Rabishu pull at my hair, Lammashta opens her dread
      jaws, AZAG-THOTH gloats blindly at his throne, KUTULU raises his head and
      stares up through the Veils of sunkun Varloorni, up through the Abyss, and
      fixes his stare upon me; wherefore I must with haste write this Book lest
      my end come sooner than I had prepared. For indeed, it appears as though I
      have failed in some regard as to the order of the rites, or to the
      formulae, or to the sacrifices, for now it appears as if the entire host
      of ERESSKIGAL lies waiting, dreaming, drooling for my departure. I pray
      the gods that I am saved (which he is not, for "gods" cannot save ones
      soul, only GOD) and not perish as did the Priest, ABDUL BEN-MARTU, in
      Jerusalem (the gods remember and have mercy upon him!). My fate is no
      longer writ in the stars, for I have broken the Chaldean Covenant by
      seeking power over the Zonei. I have set foot on the moon, and the moon no
      longer has power over me. The lines of my life have been obliterated by my
      wanderings in the Waste, over the letters writ in the heavens by the gods.
      And even now I can hear the wolves howling in the mountains as they did
      that fateful night, and they are calling my name, and the names of the
      Others. I fear for my flesh, but I fear for my spirit more.
      <P>Remember, always, in every empty moment, to call upon the gods not to
      forget thee, for they are forgetful and very far away. Light thy fires
      high in the hills, and on the tops of temples and pyramids, that they may
      see and remember.
      <P>Remember, always, to copy each of the formulae as I have put it down
      and not to change it by one line or dot, not so much as hair's breadth,
      lest it be rendered valueless, or worse: a broken line provides means of
      entrance for those Outside, for a broken star is the Gate of GANZIR, the
      Gate of Death, the Gate of the Shodows and the Shells. Recite the
      incantations as they are written here, in the manner thus prescribed.
      Prepare the rituals without erring, and in the proper places and times
      render the sacrifices.
      <P>May the gods ever be merciful unto thee!
      <P>May thou escape the jaws of the MASKIM, and vanquish the power to the
      Ancient Ones!
      <P>AND THE GODS GRANT THEE DEATH BEFORE THE ANCIENT ONES RULE THE EARTH
      ONCE MORE!
      <P>KAKAMMU! SELAH! </I>
