<H2><I><FONT size=+1>Of Ye Old Ones and their Spawn</FONT></I></H2><FONT
size=+1>The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are and the Old Ones shall be. From the
dark stars They came ere man was born, unseen and loathsome They descended to
primal earth.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Beneath the oceans They brooded while ages past, till seas gave
up the land, whereupon They swarmed forth in Their multitudes and darkness ruled
the Earth.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>At the frozen Poles They raised mighty cities, and upon high
places the temples of Those whome nature owns not and the Gods have
cursed.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>And the spawn of the Old Ones covered the Earth, and Their
children endureth throughout the ages. Ye shantaks of Leng are the work of Their
hands, the Ghasts who dwelleth in Zin's primordial vaults know Them as their
Lords. They have fathered the Na-Hag and the Gaunts that ride the Night; Great
Cthulhuis Their brother, the shaggoths Their slaves. The Dholes do homage unto
Them in the nighted vale of Pnoth and Gugs sing Their praises beneath the peaks
of ancient Throk.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>They have walked amidst the stars and They have walked the
Earth. The City of Irem in the great desert has known Them; Leng in the Cold
Waste has seen Their passing, the timeless citadel upon the cloud-vieled heights
of unknown Kadath beareth Their mark.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Wantonly the Old Ones trod the ways of darkness and Their
blasphemies were great upon the Earth; all creation bowed beneath Their might
and knew Them for Their wickedness.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>And the Elder Lords opened Their eyes and beheld the
abominations of Those that ravaged the Earth. In Their wrath They set their hand
against the Old Ones, staying Them in the midst of Their iniquity and casting
Them forth from the Earth to the Void beyond the planes where chaos reigns and
form abideth not. And the Elder Lords set Their seal upon the Gateway and the
power of the Old Ones prevailest not against its might.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Loathsome Cthulhu rose then from the deeps and raged with
exceeding great fury against the Earth Guardians. And They bound his venomous
claws with potent spells and sealed him up within the City of R'lyeh wherein
beneath the waves he shall sleep death's dream until the end of the Aeon.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=+1>Beyond the Gate dwell now the Old Ones; not in the spaces known
unto men but in the angles betwixt them. Outside Earth's plane They linger and
ever awaite the time of Their return; for the Earth has known Them and shall
know Them in time yet to come.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>And the Old Ones hold foul and formless Azathoth for Their
Master abd Abide with Him in the black cavern at the centre of all infinity,
where he gnaws ravenously in ultimate chaos amid the mad beating of hidden
drums, the tuneless piping of hideous flutes and the ceaseless bellowing of
blind idiot gods that shamble and gesture aimlessly for ever.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>The soul of Azathoth dwelleth in Yog-sothoth and He shall
beckon unto the Old Ones when the stars mark the time of Their coming; for
Yog-sothoth is the Gate through which Those of the Void will re-enter.
Yog-sothoth knowest the mazes of of time, for all time is one unto Him. He
knowest where the Old Ones came forth in time along long past and where They
shall come forth again when the cycle returneth.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>After day cometh night; man's day shall pass, and They shall
rule where They once ruled. As foulness you shall know them and Their
accursedness shall stain the Earth.</FONT> <BR>
<HR>

<H2><I><FONT size=+1>Of Ye Times and Ye Seasons to be
Observed</FONT></I></H2><FONT size=+1>Whenever thou would'st call forth Those
from Outside, thou must mark well the seasons and times in which the spheres do
intersect and the influences flow from the Void</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Thou must observe the cycle of the Moon, the movements of the
planets, the Sun's course through the Zodiac and the rising of the
constellations.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Ye Ultimate Rites shall be performed only in the seasons proper
to them, these be: at Candlemas (on the second day of the second month), at
Beltane (on the Eve of May), at Lammas (on the first day of the eighth month),
at Roodmas (on the fourteenth day of the ninth month), and at Hallowmas (on
November Eve).</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Call out to dread Azathoth when the Sun is in the sign of the
Ram, the Lion, or the Archer; the Moon decreasing and Mars and Saturn
conjoin.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Mighty Yog-sothoth shall rise to ye incantations when Sol has
entered the fiery house of Leo and the hour of Lammas be upon ye.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Evoke ye terrible Hastur on Candlemas Night, when Sol is in
Aquarius and Mercury in trine.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Supplicate Great Cthulhu only at Hallowmas Eve when the Sun
abides within the House of the Scorpion and Orion riseth. When All Hallows falls
within the cycle of the new Moon the power shall be the strongest.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Conjure Shub-Niggurath when the Beltane fires glow upon the
hills and the Sun is in the Second House, repeating the Rites of Roodmas when ye
Black One appeareth.</FONT> <BR>
<HR>

<H2><I><FONT size=+1>To Raise up Ye Stones</FONT></I></H2><FONT size=+1>To form
ye Gate through which They from ye Outer Void might manifest thou must set up ye
stones in ye elevenfold configuration.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>First thou shalt raise up ye four cardinal stones and these
shall mark ye direction of ye four winds as they howleth through their
seasons.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>To ye North set ye the stone of Great Coldness that shall form
ye Gate of ye winter-wind engraving thereupon the sigil of the Earth-Bull
thus:{Taurus sigil}</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>In ye South (at a space of five paces from ye stone of ye
North), thou shalt raise a stone of fierce-heat, through which ye summer winds
bloweth and make upon ye stone ye mark of ye Lion-serpent thus:{Leo
Sigil}</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Ye stone of whirling-air shall be set in ye East where ye first
equinox riseth and shall be graven with ye sign of he that beareth ye waters,
thus:{Aquarius Sigil}</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Ye Gate of Rushing Torrents thou cause to beat the west most
inner point (at a space of five paces from ye stone of ye East) where ye sun
dieth in ye evening and ye cycle of night returns. Blazon ye stone with ye
character of ye Scorpion whose tail reacheth unto the stars:{Scorpio
Sigil}</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Set thou the seven stones of Those that wander ye heavens,
without ye inner four and through their diverse influences shall ye focus of
power be established.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>In ye North beyond the stone of Great Coldness set ye first ye
stone of Saturn at a space of three paces. This being done proceed thou
widdershins placing at like distances apart ye stones of Jupiter, Mercury, Mars,
Venus, Sul and Luna marking each with their rightful sign.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>At ye center of the so completed configuration set ye the Alter
of ye Great Old Ones and seal it with ye symbol of Yog-Sothoth and ye mighty
Names of Azathoth, Cthulhu, Hastur, Shub-Niggurath and Nyarlathotep.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>And ye stones shall be ye Gates through which thou shalt call
Them forth from Outside man's time and space.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Entreat ye of ye stones by night and when the Moon decreasetth
in her light, turning thy face to ye direction of Their coming, speaking ye
words and making ye gestures that bringeth forth ye Old Ones and causeth Them to
walk once more ye Earth.</FONT>

potent signs shall be so formed with thy left hand when thou employeth them in
ye Rites</FONT>

symbol of ye Old Ones. Make ye thus whenever thou wouldst supplicate Those that
ever waite beyond the Threshold.</FONT>

size=+1>In the day and hour of Mercury with the Moon in her increase, thou shalt
take equal parts of Myrrh, Civet, Storax, Wormwood, Assafoetida, Galbanum and
Musk, mix well together and reduce all to the finest powder.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Place the so assembled elements in a vessel of green glass and

Moonlight for the space of one hour - keeping it concealed beneath the cloth
from cock-crow till sunset.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>All this being accomplished the incense shall be ready for use
and possessed of such vertue that he that useth it with knowledge shall have
power to call forth and command the Infernal Legions.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Nota: When employed in ye Ultimate Rites the incense may be
rendered more efficacious by the addition of one part powdered
mummy-Egypticus.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=+1>Employ the perfume of Zkauba in all ceremonies of ye ancient
Lore casting ye essences upon live coals of Yew or Oak. And when ye spirits
drawn near, the vaporous smoke shall enchant and fascinate them, binding their
powers to thy will.</FONT>
