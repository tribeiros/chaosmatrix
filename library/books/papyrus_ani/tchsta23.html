<H4>A HYMN OF PRAISE TO RA WHEN HE RISETH UPON THE HORIZON, AND WHEN HE SETTETH
IN THE LAND OF LIFE.</H4>Osiris the scribe Ani saith:- Homage to thee, O Ra,
when thou risest as Tem-Heru-Khuti. Thou art to be adored. Thy beauties are
before mine eyes, [thy] radiance is upon my body. Thou goest forth to thy
setting in the Sektet Boat with [fair] winds, and thy heart is glad; the heart
of the Matet Boat rejoiceth. Thou stridest over the heavens in peace, and all
thy foes are cast down; the stars which never rest sing hymns of praise unto
thee, and the stars which are imperishable glorify thee as thou sinkest to rest
in the horizon of Manu, O thou who art beautiful at morn and at eve, O thou lord
who livest, and art established, O my Lord!
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who art Ra when thou risest, and who art Tem when thou
settest in beauty. Thou risest and thou shinest on the back of thy mother [Nut],
O thou who art crowned the king of the gods! Nut welcometh thee, and payeth
homage unto thee, and Maat, the everlasting and never-changing goddess,
embraceth thee at noon and at eve. Thou stridest over the heavens, being glad at
heart, and the Lake of Testes is content. The Sebau-fiend hath fallen to the
ground, his fore-legs and his hind-legs have been hacked off him, and the knife
hath severed the joints of his back. Ra hath a fair wind, and the Sektet Boat
setteth out on its journey, and saileth on until it cometh into port. The gods
of the South, the gods of the North, the gods of the West, and the gods of the
East praise thee, O thou Divine Substance, from whom all living things came into
being. Thou didst send forth the word when the earth was submerged with silence,
O thou Only One, who didst dwell in heaven before ever the earth and the
mountains came into being. Hail, thou Runner, Lord, Only One, thou maker of the
things that are, thou hast fashioned the tongue of the Company of the Gods, thou
hast produced whatsoever cometh forth from the waters, thou springest up out of
them above the submerged land of the Lake of Horus. Let me breathe the air which
cometh forth from thy nostrils, and the north wind which cometh forth from thy
mother Nut. Make thou my Spirit-soul to be glorious, O Osiris, make thou my
Heart-soul to be divine. Thou art worshipped as thou settest, O Lord of the
gods, thou art exalted by reason of thy wondrous works. Shine thou with the rays
of light upon my body day by day, upon me, Osiris the scribe, the assessor of
the divine offerings of all the gods, the overseer of the granary of the Lords
of Abydos, the real royal scribe who loveth thee, Ani, whose word is truth, in
peace.
<P>Praise be unto thee, O Osiris, the Lord of Eternity, Un-Nefer, Heru-Khuti
(Harmakhis), whose forms are manifold, whose attributes are majestic [Praise be
unto thee], O thou who art Ptah-Seker-Tem in Anu, thou Lord of the hidden
shrine, thou Creator of the House of the KA of Ptah (Het-ka-Ptah) and of the
gods [therein], thou Guide of the Tuat, who art glorified when thou settest in
Nu (the Sky). Isis embraceth thee in peace, and she driveth away the fiends from
the entrances of thy paths. Thou turnest thy face towards Amentet, and thou
makest the earth to shine as with refined copper. Those who have lain down in
death rise up to see thee, they breathe the air, and they look upon thy face
when the disk riseth on the horizon. Their hearts are at peace since they behold
thee, o thou who art Eternity and Everlastingness.
<P>
