<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Turin Papyrus)</I>
<P>
<H4>ANOTHER CHAPTER WHICH IS TO BE RECITED WHEN THE MOON RENEWETH ITSELF ON THE
DAY OF THE MONTH [WHEREON IT DOETH THIS].</H4>Osiris unfettereth the storm-cloud
in the body of heaven, and is unfettered himself; Horus is made strong happily
each day. He whose transformations are many hath had offerings made unto him at
the moment, and he hath made an end of the storm which is in the face of the
Osiris, Auf-ankh, whose word is truth. Verily, he cometh, and he is Ra in
journeying, and he is the four celestial gods in the heavens above. The Osiris
Auf-ankh, whose word is truth, cometh forth in his day, and he embarketh among
the tackle of the boat.
<P><I>If this Chapter be known by the deceased he shall become a perfect
Spirit-soul in Khert-Neter, and he shall not die a second time, and he shall eat
his food side by side with Osiris. If this Chapter be known by the deceased upon
earth, he shall become like unto Thoth, and he shall be adored by those who
live. He shall not fall headlong at the moment of the intensity of the royal
flame of the goddess Bast, and the Great Prince shall make him to advance
happily.</I>
