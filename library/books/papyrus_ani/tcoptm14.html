<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu)</I>
<P>
<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT ALLOWING THE HEART.... TO BE CARRIED AWAY DEAD IN
KHERT-NETER.</H4>[Nu, whose word is truth, saith]:- My heart is with me, and it
shall never come to pass that it be carried away. I am the Lord of Hearts, the
slayer of the heart-case. I live in truth, I have my being therein. I am Horus,
the Dweller in Hearts, [I am] in the Dweller in the body. I have life by my
word, my heart hath being. My heart-case shall not be snatched away from me, it
shall not be wounded, it shall not be put in restraint if wounds are inflicted
upon me. [If] one take possession of it I shall have my being in the body of my
father Keb and in the body of my mother Nut. I have not done that which is held
in abomination by the gods. I shall not suffer defeat [for] my word is truth.
