<H3>THE SEVEN ARITS</H3><I>If [these] words be recited by the spirit when he
shall come to the Seven Arits, and as he entereth the doors, he shall neither be
turned back nor repulsed before Osiris, and he shall be made to have his being
among the blessed spirits, and to have dominion among the ancestral followers of
Osiris. If these things be done for any spirit he shall have his being in that
place like a lord of eternity in one body with Osiris, and at no place shall any
being contend against him.</I>
<H4>The Second Arit.</H4>The name of the Doorkeeper is Unhat. The name of the
Watcher is Seqt-her. The name of the Herald is Ust.
<P>The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he cometh to this Arit]:
"He sitteth to carry out his heart's desire, and he weigheth words as the Second
of Thoth. The strength which protecteth Thoth humbleth the hidden Maati gods,
who feed upon Maat during the years of their lives. I offer up my offerings [to
him] at the moment when he maketh his way. I advance, and I enter on the path. O
grant thou that I may continue to advance, and that I may attain to the sight of
Ra, and of those who offer up [their] offerings."
<P>
