<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu)</I>
<P><I>[These words] shall be said when Ra appeareth over [figures] of these gods
written in colour upon a tablet, and thou shalt place offerings of tchefau food
before them, cakes, ale, flesh, geese, and incense. They shall cause the
deceased to enjoy the "offerings which come forth at the word [of command]"
before Ra; and they shall give the deceased an abundance of food in Khert-Neter,
and shall deliver him from every evil thing whatsoever. And thou shalt not
recite this Book of Un-Nefer in the presence of anyone except thine own self. If
this be done for the deceased Ra shall be a rudder for him, and shall be to him
a strong protecting power, and he shall destroy all his enemies for him in
Khert-Neter, and in heaven, and upon earth, and in every place whereinsoever he
may enter, and he shall enjoy celestial food regularly and continually for
ever.</I>
