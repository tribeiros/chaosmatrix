<H4>[THE CHAPTER OF] MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE BENU BIRD.</H4>The
Osiris, the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I flew up out of primeval
matter. I came into being like the god Khepera. I germinated like the plants. I
am concealed like the tortoise [in his shell]. I am the seed of every god. I am
Yesterday of the Four [Quarters of the Earth, and] the Seven Uraei, who came
into being in the Eastern land. [I am] the Great One (Horus) who illumineth the
Hememet spirits with the light of his body. [I am] that god in respect of Set.
[I am] Thoth who [stood] between them (Horus and Set) as the judge on behalf of
the Governor of Sekhem and the Souls of Anu. [He was like] a stream between
them. I have come. I rise up on my throne. I am endowed with Khu. I am mighty. I
am endowed with godhood among the gods. I am Khensu, [the lord] of every kind of
strength.
<P><I>[If] this Chapter [be known by the deceased], he shall come forth pure by
day after his death, and he shall perform every transformation which hs soul
desireth to make. He shall be among the Followers of Un-Nefer, and he shall
satisfy himself with the food of Osiris, and with sepulchral meals. He shall see
the Disk [of the Sun], he shall be in good case upon earth before Ra, and his
word shall be truth in the sight of Osiris, and no evil thing whatsoever shall
have dominion over him for ever and ever.</I>
