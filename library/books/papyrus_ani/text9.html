<H2>TEXTS RELATING TO THE WEIGHING OF THE HEART OF ANI</H2><I>HERE BEGIN THE
PRAISES AND GLORIFYINGS OF COMING OUT FROM AND OF GOING INTO THE GLORIOUS
KHERT-NETER, WHICH IS IN THE BEAUTIFUL AMENTET, OF COMING FORTH BY DAY IN ALL
THE FORMS OF EXISTENCE WHICH IT MAY PLEASE THE DECEASED TO TAKE, OF PLAYING AT
DRAUGHTS, OF SITTING IN THE SEH HALL, AND OF APPEARING AS A LIVING SOUL:</I>
<P>The Osiris the scribe Ani saith after he hath arrived in his haven of rest-
now it is good for [a man] to recite [this work whilst he is] upon earth, for
then all the words of Tem come to pass-
<P>"I am the god Tem in rising. I am the Only One. I came into existence in Nu.
I am Ra who rose in the beginning, the ruler of this [creation]."
<P>Who is this?
<P>"It is Ra, when at the beginning he rose in the city of Hensu, crowned like a
king for his coronation. The Pillars of the god Shu were not as yet created,
when he was upon the steps of him that dwelleth in Khemenu.
<P>"I am the Great God who created himself, even Nu, who made his names to
become the Company of the Gods as gods."
<P>Who is this?
<P>"It is Ra, the creator of the names of his limbs, which came into being in
the form of the gods who are in the train of Ra.
<P>"I am he who cannot be repulsed among the gods."
<P>Who is this?
<P>"It is Temu, the dweller in his disk, but others say that it is Ra when he
riseth in the eastern horizon of the sky.
<P>"I am Yesterday, I know To-day."
<P>Who is this?
<P>"Yesterday is Osiris, and To-day is Ra, when he shall destroy the enemies of
Neb-er-tcher (the lord to the uttermost limit), and when he shall establish as
prince and ruler his son Horus.
<P>"Others, however, say that To-day is Ra, on the day when we commemorate the
festival of the meeting of the dead Osiris with his father Ra, and when the
battle of the gods was fought, in which Osiris, the Lord of Amentet, was the
leader."
<P>What is this?
<P>"It is Amentet, [that is to say] the creation ofthe souls of the gods when
Osiris was leader in Set-Amentet.
<P>"Others, however, say that it is the Amentet which Ra hath given unto me;
when any god cometh he must rise up and fight for it. "I know the god who
dwelleth therein."
<P>Who is this?
<P>"It is Osiris. Others, however, say that his name is Ra, and that the god who
dwelleth in Amentet is the phallus of Ra, wherewith he had union with himself.
<P>"I am the Benu bird which is in Anu. I am the keeper of the volume of the
book (the Tablet of Destiny) of the things which have been made, and of the
things which shall be made."
<P>Who is this?
<P>"It is Osiris.
<P>"Others, however, say that it is the dead body of Osiris, and yet others say
that it is the excrement of Osiris. The things which have been made, and the
things which shall be made [refer to] the dead body of Osiris. Others again say
that the things which have been made are Eternity, and the things which shall be
made are Everlastingness, and that Eternity is the Day, and Everlastingness the
Night.
<P>"I am the god Menu in his coming forth; may his two plumes be set on my head
for me."
<P>Who is this?
<P>"Menu is Horis, the Advocate of his father [Osiris], and his coming forth
means his birth. The two plumes on his head are Isis and Nephthys, when these
goddesses go forth and set themselves thereon, and when they act as his
protectors, and when they provide that which his head lacketh.
<P>"Others, however, say that the two plumes are the two exceedingly large uraei
which are upon the head of their father Tem, and there are yet others who say
that the two plumes which are upon the head of Menu are his two eyes.
<P>"The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is true, the registrar of all the
offerings which are made to the gods, riseth up and cometh into his city."
<P>What is this [city]?
<P>"It is the horizon of his father Tem.
<P>"I have made an end of my shortcomings, and I have put away my faults."
<P>What is this?
<P>"It is the cutting of the navel string of the body of the Osiris the scribe
Ani, whose word is true before all the gods, and all his faults are driven out.
<P>What is this ?
<P>"It is the purification [of Osiris] on the day of his birth.
<P>"I am purified in my great double nest which is in Hensu on the day of the
offerings of the followers of the Great God who dwelleth therein."
<P>What is the "great double nest"?
<P>"The name of one nest is 'Millions of years,' and 'Great Green [Sea]' is the
name of the other, that is to say 'Lake of Natron' and 'Lake of Salt.'
<P>"Others, however, say the name of the one is 'Guide of Millions of Years,'
and that 'Great Green Lake' is name of the other. Yet others say that 'Begetter
of Millions of Years' is the name of one, and 'Great Green Lake' is the name of
the other. Now, as concerning the Great God who dwelleth therein, it is Ra
himself.
<P>"I pass over the way, I know the head of the Island of Maati."
<P>What is this?
<P>"It is Ra-stau, that is to say, it is the gate to the South of Nerutef, and
it is the Northern Gate of the Domain (Tomb of the god). "Now, as concerning the
Island of Maati, it is Abtu.
<P>"Others, however, say that it is the way by which Father Tem travelleth when
he goeth forth to Sekhet-Aaru, [the place] which produceth the food and
sustenance of the gods who are [in] their shrines.
<P>"Now the Gate Tchesert is the Gate of the Pillars of Shu, that is to say, the
Northern Gate of the Tuat.
<P>"Others, however, say that the Gate of Tchesert is the two leaves of the door
through which the god Tem passeth when he goeth forth to the eastern horizon of
the sky.
<P>"O ye gods who are in the presence [of Osiris], grant to me your arms, for I
am the god who shall come into being among you."
<P>Who are these gods?
<P>"They are the drops of blood which came forth from the phallus of Ra when he
went forth to perform his own mutilitation. These drops of blood sprang into
being under the forms of the gods Hu and Sa, who are in the bodyguard of Ra, and
who accompany the god Tem daily and every day.
<P>"I, Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, have filled for thee the
utchat (the Eye of Ra, or of Horus), when it had suffered extinction on the day
of the combat of the Two Fighters (Horus and Set)."
<P>What was this combat?
<P>It was the combat which took place on the day when Horus fought with Set,
during which Set threw filth in the face of Horus, and Horus crushed the
genitals of Set. The filling of the utchat Thoth performed with his own fingers.
<P>"I remove the thunder-cloud from the sky when there is a storm with thunder
and lightning therein."
<P>What is this?
<P>"This storm was the raging of Ra at the thunder-cloud which [Set] sent forth
against the Right Eye of Ra (the Sun). Thoth removed the thunder-cloud from the
Eye of Ra, and brought back the Eye living, healthy, sound, and with no defect
in it to its owner.
<P>"Others, however, say that the thunder-cloud is caused by sickness in the Eye
of Ra, which weepeth for its companion Eye (the Moon); at this time Thoth
cleanseth the Right Eye of Ra.
<P>"I behold Ra who was born yesterday from the thighs of the goddess Mehurt;
his strength is my strength, and my strength is his strength."
<P>Who is this?
<P>"Mehurt is the great Celestial Water, but others say that Mehurt is the image
of the Eye of Ra at dawn at his birth daily.
<P>"[Others, however, say that] Mehurt is the utchat of Ra.
<P>"Now Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, is a very great one among
the gods who are in the following of Horus; they say that he is the prince who
loveth his lord."
<P>Who are the gods who are in the train of Horus?
<P>"[They are] Kesta, Hapi, Taumutef, and Qebhsenuf.
<P>"Homage to you, O ye lords of right and truth, ye sovereign princes
(Tchatcha) who [stand] round about Osiris, who do away utterly sins and
offences, and who are in the following of the goddess Hetepsekhus, grant ye that
I may come unto you. Destroy ye all the faults which are within me, even as ye
did for the Seven Spirits who are among the followers of their lord Sepa. Anpu
(Anubis) appointed to them their places on the day [when he said unto them],
"Come ye hither."
<P>Who are the "lords of right and truth"?
<P>"The lords of right and truth are Thoth and Astes, the Lord of Amentet.
<P>"The Tchatcha round about Osiris are Kesta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Qebhsenuf,
and they are also round about the Constellation of the Thigh (the Great Bear),
in the northern sky.
<P>"Those who do away utterly sins and offences, and who are in the following of
the goddess Hetepsekhus, are the god Sebek and his associates who dwell in the
water.
<P>"The goddess Hetepsekhus is the Eye of Ra.
<P>"Others, however, say that it is the flame which accompanieth Osiris to burn
up the souls of his enemies. "As concerning all the faults which are in Osiris,
the registrar of the offerings which are made unto all the gods, Ani, whose word
is truth, [these are all the offences which he hath committed against the Lords
of Eternity] since he came forth from his mother's womb.
<P>"As concerning the Seven Spirits who are Kesta, Hapi, Tuamutef, Qebhsenuf,
Maa-atef, Kheribeqef and Heru-khenti-en-ariti, these did Anubis appoint to be
protectors of the dead body of Osiris.
<P>"Others, however, say that he set them round about the holy place of Osiris.
<P>"Others say that the Seven Spirits [which were appointed by Anubis] were
Netcheh-netcheh, Aatqetqet, Nertanef-besef-khenti-hehf, Aq-her-ami-unnut-f,
Tesher-ariti-ami-Het-anes, Ubes-her-per-em-khetkhet, and
Maaem-kerh-annef-em-hru.
<P>"The chief of the Tchatcha (sovereign princes) who is in Naarutef is Horus,
the Advocate of his father.
<P>"As concerning the day wherein [Anubis said to the Seven Spirits], 'Come ye
hither,' [the allusion here] is to the words 'Come ye hither,' which Ra spake
unto Osiris."
<P>Verily may these same words be said unto me in Amentet.
<P>"I am the Divine Soul which dwelleth in the Divine Twin-gods."
<P>Who is this Divine Soul?
<P>"It is Osiris. [When] he goeth into Tetu, and findeth there the Soul of Ra,
the one god embraceth the other, and two Divine Souls spring into being within
the Divine Twin-gods."
<P>
