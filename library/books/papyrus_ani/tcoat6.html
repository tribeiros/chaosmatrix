<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(In the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 14, the Chapter ends with the following.)</I>

<P>Exalted art thou on thy throne, O Osiris! Thou hast heard fair things, O
Osiris! Thy strength is vigorous, O Osiris! Thy head is fastened on thy body, O
Osiris! Thy neck is made firm, O Osiris! Thy heart is glad, [O Osiris!]. Thy
speech is made effective, O Osiris! Thy princes rejoice Thou art established the
Bull in Amentet. Thy son Horus hath ascended thy trrone, and all life is with
him. Millions of years minister unto him, and millions of years hold him in
fear. The Company of the Gods are his servants, and they fold him in fear. The
god Tem, the Governor, the only One among the gods, hath spoken, and his word
passeth not away. Horus is both the divine food and the sacrifice. He made haste
to gather together [the members of] of his father. Horus is his deliverer. Horus
is his deliverer. Horus hath sprung from the essence of his divine father and
from his decay. He hath become the Governor of Egypt. The gods shall work for
him, and they shall toil for him for million of years. He shall make millions of
years to live through his Eye, the only one of its lord, Nebertcher.]
<P><I>(From the Turin Papyrus, Bl. XXX)</I>
<P>Exalted is thy throne, O Osiris. Thou hearest well, O Osiris. Thy strength
flourisheth, O Osiris. I have fastened thy head [on thy] body for thee. I have
stablished thy throat, the throne of the joy of thy heart. Thy words are stable.
Thy shenit princes are glad. Thou art stablished as the Bull of Amentet. Thy son
Horus hath ascended thy throne. All life is with him. Millions of years work for
him. The Company of the Gods fear him. Tem, the One Power of the Gods, hath
spoken, and what he hath said is not changed, Hetu Aabi. Horus hath stood up. I
have gone about collecting his father. Horus hath delivered his father. Horus
hath delivered [his mother]. My mother is Horus. My brother is Horus. My uncle
is Horus. I have come. Horus followeth his father.... there the dirt of his
head. The gods shall serve him. Millions of years...... in his Eye, the Only One
of its Lord, Neb-er-tcher.
