<H4>THE CHAPTER OF BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE PRINCE OF THE TCHATCHAU
CHIEFS.</H4>The Osiris Nu, whose word is truth, saith:- I am the god Tem, the
maker of the sky, the creator of the things which are, who cometh forth from the
earth, who made the seed of man to come into being, the Lord of things, who
fashioned the gods, the Great God, who created himself, the Lord of Life, who
made to flourish the Two Companies of the Gods. Homage to you, O ye divine Lords
of things, ye holy beings, whose seats are veiled! Homage to you, O ye Lords of
Eternity, whose forms are concealed, whose sanctuaries are mysteries, whose
places of abode are not known! Homage to you, O ye gods, who dwell in the Tenait
(Circle of Light)! Homage to you, O ye gods of the Circle of the country of the
Cataracts! Homage to you, O ye gods who dwell in Amentet! Homage to you, O ye
gods who dwell within Nut! Grant ye to me that I may come before you, I am pure,
I am like a god. I am endowed with a Spirit-soul. I am strong. I am endowed with
a Heart-soul. I bring unto you incense, and spice, and natron. I have done away
with the chidings of your mouths. I have come, I have done away the evil which
was in your hearts, and I have removed the offences which appertained to you
[against me]. I bring to you deeds of well-doing, and I present before you
truth. I know you. I know your names. I know your forms which are not known. I
come into being among you. My coming is like unto that god who eateth men, and
who feedeth upon the gods. I am strong before you even like that god who is
exalted upon his pedestal, unto whom the gods come with rejoicing, and the
goddesses make supplication when they see me. I have come unto you. I have
ascended my throne like your Two Daughters. I have taken my seat in the horizon.
I receive my offerings of propitiation upon my altars. I drink my fill of seth
wine every evening. I come to those who are making rejoicings, and the gods who
live in the horizon ascribe unto me praises, as the divine Spirit-body, the Lord
of mortals. I am exalted like that holy god who dwelleth in the Great House. The
gods rejoice greatly when they see my beautiful appearances from the body of the
goddess Nut, and when the goddess Nut bringeth me forth.
