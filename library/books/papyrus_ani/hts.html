<H1>HYMN TO OSIRIS</H1>"Homage to thee, Osiris, Lord of eternity, King of the
Gods, whose names are manifold, whose forms are holy, thou being of hidden form
in the temples, whose Ka is holy. Thou art the governor of Tattu (Busiris), and
also the mighty one in Sekhem (Letopolis). Thou art the Lord to whom praises are
ascribed in the nome of Ati, thou art the Prince of divine food in Anu. Thou art
the Lord who is commemorated in Maati, the Hidden Soul, the Lord of Qerrt
(Elephantine), the Ruler supreme in White Wall (Memphis). Thou art the Soul of
Ra, his own body, and hast thy place of rest in Henensu (Herakleopolis). Thou
art the beneficent one, and art praised in Nart. Thou makest thy soul to be
raised up. Thou art the Lord of the Great House in Khemenu (Hermopolis). Thou
art the mighty one of victories in Shas-hetep, the Lord of eternity, the
Governor of Abydos. The path of his throne is in Ta-tcheser (a part of Abydos).
Thy name is established in the mouths of men. Thou art the substance of Two
Lands (Egypt). Thou art Tem, the feeder of Kau (Doubles), the Governor of the
Companies of the gods. Thou art the beneficent Spirit among the spirits. The god
of the Celestial Ocean (Nu) draweth from thee his waters. Thou sendest forth the
north wind at eventide, and breath from thy nostrils to the satisfaction of thy
heart. Thy heart reneweth its youth, thou producest the.... The stars in the
celestial heights are obedient unto thee, and the great doors of the sky open
themselves before thee. Thou art he to whom praises are ascribed in the southern
heaven, and thanks are given for thee in the northern heaven. The imperishable
stars are under thy supervision, and the stars which never set are thy thrones.
Offerings appear before thee at the decree of Keb. The Companies of the Gods
praise thee, and the gods of the Tuat (Other World) smell the earth in paying
homage to thee. The uttermost parts of the earth bow before thee, and the limits
of the skies entreat thee with supplications when they see thee. The holy ones
are overcome before thee, and all Egypt offereth thanksgiving unto thee when it
meeteth Thy Majesty. Thou art a shining Spirit-Body, the governor of
Spirit-Bodies; permanent is thy rank, established is thy rule. Thou art the
well-doing Sekhem (Power) of the Company of the Gods, gracious is thy face, and
beloved by him that seeth it. Thy fear is set in all the lands by reason of thy
perfect love, and they cry out to thy name making it the first of names, and all
people make offerings to thee. Thou art the lord who art commemorated in heaven
and upon earth. Many are the cries which are made to thee at the Uak festival,
and with one heart and voice Egypt raiseth cries of joy to thee.
<P>"Thou art the Great Chief, the first among thy brethren, the Prince of the
Company of the Gods, the stablisher of Right and Truth throughout the World, the
Son who was set on the great throne of his father Keb. Thou art the beloved of
thy mother Nut, the mighty one of valour, who overthrew the Sebau-fiend. Thou
didst stand up and smite thine enemy, and set thy fear in thine adversary. Thou
dost bring the boundaries of the mountains. Thy heart is fixed, thy legs are set
firm. Thou art the heir of Keb and of the sovereignty of the Two Lands (Egypt).
He (Keb) hath seen his splendours, he hath decreed for him the guidance of the
world by thy hand as long as times endure. Thou hast made this earth with thy
hand, and the waters, and the winds, and the vegetation, and all the cattle, and
all the feathered fowl, and all the fish, and all the creeping things, and all
the wild animals therof. The desert is the lawful possession of the son of Nut.
The Two Lands (Egypt) are content to crown thee upon the throne of thy father,
like Ra.
<P>"Thou rollest up into the horizon, thou hast set light over the darkness,
thou sendest forth air from thy plumes, and thou floodest the Two Lands like the
Disk at daybreak. Thy crown penetrateth the height of heaven, thou art the
companion of the stars, and the guide of every god. Thou art beneficent in
decree and speech, the favoured one of the Great Company of the Gods, and the
beloved of the Little Company of the Gods.
<P>His sister [Isis] hath protected him, and hath repulsed the fiends, and
turned aside calamities (of evil). She uttered the spell with the magical power
of her mouth. Her tongue was perfect, and it never halted at a word. Beneficent
in command and word was Isis, the woman of magical spells, the advocate of her
brother. She sought him untiringly, she wandered round and round about this
earth in sorrow, and she alighted not without finding him. She made light with
her feathers, she created air with her wings, and she uttered the death wail for
her brother. She raised up the inactive members of whose heart was still, she
drew from him his essence, she made an heir, she reared the child in loneliness,
and the place where he was not known, and he grew in strength and stature, and
his hand was mighty in the House of Keb. The Company of the Gods rejoiced,
rejoiced, at the coming of Horus, the son of Osiris, whose heart was firm, the
triumphant, the son of Isis, the heir of Osiris."
