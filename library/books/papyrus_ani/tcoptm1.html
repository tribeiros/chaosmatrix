<H4>THE CHAPTER OF BRINGING WORDS OF POWER TO THE OSIRIS ANI,</H4>who saith:- I
am Tem-Khepera who produced himself on the thighs of his divine mother. Those
who dwell in Nu have been made wolves, and those who are among the Tchatcha
Chiefs have become hyenas. Behold, I will gather together to myself this charm
from the person with whom it is [and from the place] wherein it is [and it shall
come to me] quicker than a greyhound, and swifter that light. Hail, thou who
bringest the Ferry-Boat of Ra, thou holdest thy course firmly and directly in
the north wind as thou sailest up the river towards the Island of Fire which is
in Khert-Neter. Behold, thou shalt gather together to thee this charm from
wheresoever it may be, and from whomsoever it may be with [and it shall come to
me] quicker than a greyhound, and swifter than light. It (the charm) made the
transformations of Mut; it fashioned the gods [or] kept them silent; by it Mut
gave the warmth [of life] to the gods. Behold, these words of power are mine,
and they shall come unto me from wheresoever they may be, or with whomsoever
they may be, quicker than greyhounds and swifter than light, or, according to
another reading, "swifter than shadows."
