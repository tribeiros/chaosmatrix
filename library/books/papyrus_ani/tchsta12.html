<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papryus of Nebseni, Sheet 6)</I>
<P>That which was shut hath been opened [that is] the dead. That which was shut
fast hath been opened by the command of the Eye of Horus, which hath delivered
me. Established are the beauties on the forehead of Ra. My steps are long. My
legs are lifted up. I have performed the journey, my members are mighty and are
sound. I am Horus, the Avenger of his Father. I am he who bringeth along his
father, and his mother, by means of his staff. The way shall be opened to him
that hath power over his feet, and he shall see the Great God in the Boat of Ra,
when souls are counted therein at the bows, and when the years also are counted
up. Grant that the Eye of Horus, which maketh the adornments of splendour to be
firm on the forehead of Ra, may deliver my soul for me, and let darkness cover
your faces, O ye who would imprison Osiris. O keep not captive my soul. O keep
not ward over my shadow, but let a way be opened for my soul and my shadow, and
let them see the Great God in the shrine on the day of the counting of souls,
and let them hold converse with Osiris, whose habitations are hidden, and those
who guard the members of Osiris, and who keep ward over the Spirit-souls, and
who hold captive the shadows of the dead, and who would work evil against me, so
that they shall [not] work evil against me. A way shall be for KA with thee, and
thy soul shall be prepared by those who keep ward over the members of Osiris,
and who hold captive the shadows of the dead. Heaven shall not keep thee fast,
the earth shall not hold thee captive. Thou shalt not live with the beings who
slay, but thou shalt be master of thy legs, and thou shalt advance to thy body
straightway in the earth, [and to] those who belong to the shrine of Osiris and
guard his members.
<P>
