<BODY><H4)[THE h4 DARKNESS.< THE LIGHTENETH WHO GOD INTO TRANSFORMATION MAKING
OF] CHAPTER>The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I am the
girdle of the garment of the god Nu, which giveth light, and shineth, and
belongeth to his breast, the illuminer of the darkness, the uniter of the two
Rehti deities, the dweller in my body, through the great spell of the words of
my mouth. I rise up, but he who was coming after me hath fallen. He who was with
him in the Valley of Abtu hath fallen. I rest. I remember him. The god Hu hath
taken possession of me in my town. I found him there. I have carried away the
darkness by my strength, I have filled the Eye [of Ra] when it was helpless, and
when it came not on the festival of the fifteenth day. I have weighed Sut in the
celestial houses against the Aged One who was with him. I have equipped Thoth in
the House of the Moon-god, when the fifteenth day of the festival come not. I
have taken possession of the Urrt Crown. Truth is in my body; turquoise and
crystal are its months. My homestead is there among the lapis-lazuli, among the
furrows thereof. I am Hem-Nu, the lightener of the darkness. I have come to
lighten the darkness; it is light. I have lightened the darkness. I have
overthrown the ashmiu-fiends. I have sung hymns to those who dwell in the
darkness. I have made to stand up the weeping ones, whose faces were covered
over; they were in a helpless state of misery. Look ye then upon me. I am
Hem-Nu. I will not let you hear concerning it. [I have fought. I am Hem-Nu. I
have lightened the darkness. I have come. I have made an end to the darkness
which hath become light indeed.]
