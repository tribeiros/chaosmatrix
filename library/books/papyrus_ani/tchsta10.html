<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE SOUL OF A MAN BE HELD CAPTIVE IN
KHERT-NETER</A>.</H4>The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, thou who art exalted!
<P>Hail, thou who art adored! Hail, Mighty One of Souls, thou divine Soul who
inspirest great dread, who dost set the fear of thyself in the gods, who are
enthroned upon thy mighty seat. Make thou a path for the Spirit-soul and the
Ba-soul of the Osiris Ani. I am equipped with [words of power]. I am a
Spirit-soul equipped with [words of power]. I have made my way to the place
where are Ra and Hathor.
<P><I>If this Chapter be known by the deceased he shall be able to transform
himself into a Spirit-soul who shall be equipped with [his soul and his shadow]
in Khert-Neter, and he shall not be shut up inside any door in Amentet, when he
is coming forth upon the Earth, or when he is going back into [Khert-Neter.]</I>

<P>
