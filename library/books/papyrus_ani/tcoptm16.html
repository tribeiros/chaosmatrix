<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 5)</I>
<P>
<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF NU, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH, BE CARRIED
AWAY FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER.</H4>He saith:- Hail, thou Lion-god! I am Unb (the
Blossom). That which is held in abomination to me is the block of slaughter of
the god. Let not this my heart-case be carried away from me by the Fighting Gods
in Anu. Hail, thou who dost wind bandages round Osiris, and who hast seen Set.
Hail, thou who returnest after smiting and destroying him before the mighty
ones! This my heart weepeth over itself before Osiris; it hath made supplication
for me. I have given unto him and I have dedicated unto him the thoughts of the
heart in the House of the god (Usekh-her), have brought unto him sand at the
entry to Khemenu. Let not this my heart-case be carried away from me. I make you
to ascend his throne, to fetter heart-cases for him in Sekhet-hetep, [to live]
years of strength away from things of all kinds which are abominations to him,
to carry off food from among the things which are thine, and which are in thy
grasp through thy strength. And this my heart-case is devoted to the decrees of
the god Tem, who guideth me through the caverns of Suti, but let not this my
heart, which hath performed its desire before the Tchatcha Chiefs who are in
Khert-Neter, be given to him. When they find the leg and the swathings they bury
them.
