<H2>THE CHAPTERS OF COMING FORTH BY DAY</H2>
<P align=center>HERE BEGIN THE CHAPTERS OF COMING FORTH BY DAY, AND THE SONGS OF
PRAISING AND GLORIFYING WHICH ARE TO BE RECITED FOR "COMING FORTH" AND FOR
ENTERING INTO KHERT-NETER, AND THE SPELLS WHICH ARE TO BE SAID IN BEAUTIFUL
AMENTET. THEY SHALL BE RECITED ON THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL, ENTERING IN AFTER
COMING FORTH.</P>The Osiris Ani, the Osiris the scribe Ani saith:- Homage to
thee, O Bull of Amentet, Thoth the king of eternity is with me. I am the great
god by the side of the divine boat, I have fought for thee, I am one of those
gods, those divine chiefs, who proved the truth-speaking of Osiris before his
enemies on the day of the weighing of words. I am thy kinsman Osiris. I am [one
of] those gods who were the children of the goddess Nut, who hacked in pieces
the enemies of Osiris, and who bound in fetters the legion of Sebau devils on
his behalf. I am thy kinsman Horus, I have fought on thy behalf, I have come to
thee for thy name's sake. I am Thoth who proved the truth of the words of Osiris
before his enemies on the day of the weighing of words in the great House of the
Prince, who dwelleth in Anu. I am Teti, the son of Teti. My mother conceived me
in Tetu, and gave birth to me in Tetu. I am with the mourners [and with] the
women who tear out their hair and make lament for Osiris in Taui-Rekhti, proving
true the words of Osiris before his enemies. Ra commanded Thoth to prove true
the words of Osiris before his enemies; what was commanded [for Osiris], let
that be done for me by Thoth. I am with Horus on the day of dressing Teshtesh. I
open the hidden water-springs for the ablutions of Urt-ab. I unbolt the door of
the Shetait Shrine in Ra-stau. I am with Horus as the protector of the left
shoulder of Osiris, the dweller in Sekhem. I enter in among and I come forth
from the Flame-gods on the day of the destruction of the Sebau fiends in Sekhem.
I am with Horus on the day[s] of the festivals of Osiris, at the making of
offerings and oblations, namely, on the festival which is celebrated on the
sixth day of the month, and on the day of the Tenat festival in Anu. I am the
UAB priest (libationer) in Tetu, Rera, the dweller in Per-Asar. I exalt him that
is upon the high place of the country. I look upon the hidden things (the
mysteries) in Ra-stau. I recite the words of the liturgy of the festival of the
Soul-god in Tetu. I am the SEM priest, and [perform] his duties. I am the
UR-KHERP-HEM priest on the day of placing the Henu Boat of Seker upon its divine
sledge. I have taken in my hand the digging tool on the day of digging up the
earth in Hensu.
<P>Hail, O ye who make perfect souls to enter into the House of Osiris, make ye
the well-instructed soul of the Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is true, to
enter in and to be with you in the House of Osiris. Let him hear even as ye
hear; let him have sight even as ye have sight; let him stand up even as ye
stand up; let him take his seat even as ye take your seats.
<P>Hail, O ye who give cakes and ale to perfect souls in the House of Osiris,
give ye cakes and ale twice each day (in the morning and in the evening) to the
soul of the Osiris Ani, whose word is true before the gods, the Lords of Abydos,
and whose word is true with you. Hail, O ye who open up the way, who act as
guides to the roads [in the Other World] to perfect souls in the House of
Osiris, open ye up for him the way, and act ye as guides to the roads to the
soul of the Osiris, the scribe, the registrary of all the offerings made to the
gods, Ani, [whose word is true] with you. May he enter the House of Osiris with
boldness, and may he come forth therefrom in peace. May there be no opposition
made to him, and may he not be sent back [therefrom]. May he enter in under
favour [of Osiris], and may he come forth gratified [at the acceptance of] his
true words. May his commands be performed in the House of Osiris, may his words
travel with you, may he be glorious as ye are. May he be not found to be light
in the Balance, may the Balance dispose of his case.
<P><I>(In the Turin Papyrus, ed. Lepsius, this Chapter ends with the
following.)</I>
<P>Permit thou not me to be judged according to the mouths of the multitude. May
my soul lift itself up before [Osiris], having been found to have been pure when
on earth. May I come into thy presence, O Lord of the gods; may I arrive at the
Nome of Maati (Truth); may I rise up on my seat like a god endowed with life;
may I give forth light like the Company of the Gods who dwell in heaven; may I
become like one of you; may I lift up my footsteps in the town of Kher-Aha; may
I look upon the Sektet Boat of the god, Saah, the holy one, as it passeth across
the sky; may I not be repulsed; may I look upon the Lords of the Tuat, or,
according to another reading, the Company of the Gods; may I smell the savour of
the divine food of the Company of the Gods; may I sit down with them; may my
name be proclaimed for offerings by the KHER-HEB priest at the sacrificial
table; may I hear the petitions which are made when offerings are presented; may
I draw nigh unto the Neshem Boat; and may neither my Heart-soul nor its lord be
repulsed.
<P>Homage to thee, O Chief of Amentet, thou god Osiris, who dwellest in the town
of Nifu-ur. Grant thou that I may arrive in peace in Amentet. May the Lords of
Ta-Tchesert receive me, and may they say unto me: "Hail, hail; welcome,
welcome!" May they make ready for me a seat by the side of the President of the
Chiefs; may the Nursing-goddesses receive me at the seasons, and may I come
forth into the presence of Un-Nefer true of word. May I be a Follower of Horus
in Ra-stau, and of Osiris in Tetu; and may I perform all the transformations
which my heart may desire to make in every place wherein my Double (KA) wisheth
to be.
<P>
