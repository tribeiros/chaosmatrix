<H4>THE CHAPTER OF MAKING THE SOUL TO BE JOINED TO ITS BODY IN
KHERT-NETER.</H4>The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, thou god Aniu! Hail, thou god
Pehreri, who dwellest in thy hall, the Great God. Grant thou that my soul may
come to me from any place wherein it may be. Even if it would tarry, let my soul
be brought unto me from any place wherein it may be. Thou findest the Eye of
Horus standing by thee like unto those beings who resemble Osiris, who never lie
down in death. Let not the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, lie down dead among
those who lie in Anu, the land wherein [souls] are joined to their bodies in
thousands. Let me have possession of my Ba-soul and of my Spirit-soul, and let
my word be truth with it (the Ba-soul) in every place wherein it may be. Observe
then, O ye guardians of Heaven, my soul [wherever it may be]. Even if it would
tarry, cause thou my Ba-soul to see my body. Thou shalt find the Eye of Horus
standing by thee like [the Watchers].
<P>Hail, ye gods who tow along the boat of the Lord of Millions of Years, who
bring it over the sky of the Tuat, who make it to journey over Nent, who make
Ba-souls to enter into their Spirit-bodies, whose hands hold the steering poles
and guide it straight, who grasp tightly your paddles, destroy ye the Enemy;
thus shall the Boat rejoice, and the Great God shall travel on his way in peace.
Moreover, grant ye that the Ba-soul of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth
before the gods, may come forth with your navel cords in the eastern part of the
sky, and that it may follow Ra to the place where he was yesterday, and may set
in peace, in peace in Amentet. May it gaze upon its earthly body, may it take up
its abode and its Spirit-body, may it neither perish nor be destroyed for ever
and for ever.
<P><I>These words shall be said over a model of the Ba-soul made of gold, and
inlaid with precious stones, which shall be placed on the breast of the
Osiris.</I>
<P>
