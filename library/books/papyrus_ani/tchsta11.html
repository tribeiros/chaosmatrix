<H4>THE CHAPTER OF OPENING THE TOMB TO THE BA-SOUL AND THE SHADOW, AND OF COMING
FORTH BY DAY, AND OF HAVING MASTERY OVER THE TWO LEGS.</H4>The Osiris the scribe
Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- The place which is closed is opened, the place
which is shut (or sealed) is sealed. That which lieth down in the closed place
is opened by the Ba-soul which is in it. By the Eye of Horus I am delivered.
Ornaments are stablished on the brow of Ra. My stride is made long. I lift up my
two thighs [in walking]. I have journeyed over a long road. My limbs are in a
flourishing condition. I am Horus, the Avenger of his Father, and I bring the
Urrt Crown [and set it on] its standard. The road of souls is opened. My twin
soul seeth the Great God in the Boat of Ra, on the day of souls. My soul is in
the front thereof with the counter of the years. Come, the Eye of Horus hath
delivered for me my soul, my ornaments are stablished on the brow of Ra. Light
is on the faces of those who are in the members of Osiris. Ye shall not hold
captive my soul. Ye shall not keep in durance my shadow. The way is open to my
soul and to my shadow. It seeth the Great God in the shrine on the day of
counting souls. It repeateth the words of Osiris. Those whose seats are
invisible, who fetter the members of Osiris, who fetter Heart-souls and
Spirit-souls, who set a seal upon the dead, and who would do evil to me, shall
do no evil to me. Haste on the way to me. Thy heart is with thee. My Heart-soul
and my Spirit-soul are equipped; they guide thee. I sit down at the head of the
great ones who are chiefs of their abodes. The wardens of the members of Osiris
shall not hold thee captive, though they keep ward over souls, and set a seal on
the shadow which is dead. Heaven shall not shut thee in.
<P><I>RUBRIC: If this Chapter be known by the deceased he shall come forth by
day, and his soul shall not be kept captive.</I>
