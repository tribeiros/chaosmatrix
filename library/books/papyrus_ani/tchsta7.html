<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT BEING TRANSPORTED TO THE EAST IN KHERT-NETER.</H4>The
Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, Phallus of Ra, which advanceth and beateth down
opposition. Things which have been without motion for millions of years have
come into life through Baba. I am stronger thereby than the strong, and I have
more power thereby than the mighty. Now, let me not be carried away in a boat,
or be seized violently and taken to the East, to have the festivals of Sebau
Devils celebrated on me. Let not deadly wounds be inflicted upon me, and let me
not be gored by horns. Thou shalt neither fall [nor] eat fish made by Tebun.
<P>Now, no evil thing of any kind whatsoever shall be done unto me by the Sebau
Devils. [I shall not be gored by] horns. Therefore the Phallus of Ra, [which is]
the head of Osiris, shall not be swallowed up. Behold, I shall come into me
fields and I shall cut the grain. The gods shall provide me with food. Thou
shalt not then be gored, Ra-Khepera. There shall not be then pus in the Eye of
Tem, and it shall not be destroyed. Violence shall not be done unto me, and I
shall not be carried away in [my] boat to the East to have the festivals of the
Sebau Devils celebrated on me in evil fashion. Cruel gashes with knives shall
not be inflicted upon me, and I shall not be carried away in [my] boat to the
East. I the Osiris, the assessor of the holy offerings of all the gods, Ani,
whose word is truth, happily, the lord of fealty [to Osiris].
<P>
