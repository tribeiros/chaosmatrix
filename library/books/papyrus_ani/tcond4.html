<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu, Brit. Mus. No. 10477, Sheet 22)</I>
<P>[THE FOLLOWING] WORDS SHALL BE SAID BY THE STEWARD OF THE KEEPER OF THE SEAL,
NU, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH, WHEN HE COMETH FORTH TO THE HALL OF MAATI, SO THAT HE
MAY BE SEPARATED FROM EVERY SIN WHICH HE HATH COMMITTED, AND MAY BEHOLD THE
FACES OF THE GODS. The Osiris Nu, whose word is truth, saith: Homage to thee, O
great God, Lord of Maati! I have come unto thee, O my Lord, and I have brought
myself hither that I may behold thy beauties. I know thee, I know thy name, I
know the names of the Forty-two Gods who live with thee in this Hall of Maati,
who live by keeping ward over sinners, and who feed upon their blood on the day
when the consciences of men are reckoned up in the presence of the god Un-Nefer.
In truth thy name is Rehti-Merti-Nebti-Maati. In truth I have come unto thee, I
have brought Maati (Truth) to thee. I have done away sin for thee. I have not
committed sins against men. I have not opposed my family and kinsfolk. I have
not acted fraudulently in the Seat of Truth. I have not known men who were of no
account. I have not wrought evil. I have not made it to be the first
[consideration daily that unnecessary] work should be done for me. I have not
brought forward my name for dignities. I have not [attempted] to direct servants
[I have not belittled God]. I have not defrauded the humble man of his property.
I have not done what the gods abominate. I have not vilified a slave to his
master. I have not inflicted pain. I have not caused anyone to go hungry. I have
not made any man to weep. I have not committed murder. I have not given the
order for murder to be committed. I have not caused calamities to befall men and
women. I have not plundered the offerings in the temples. I have not defrauded
the gods of their cake-offerings. I have not carried off the fenkhu cakes
[offered to] the Spirits. I have not committed fornication. I have not
masturbated [in the sanctuaries of the god of my city]. I have not diminished
from the bushel. I have not filched [land from my neighbour's estate and] added
it to my own acre. I have not encroached upon the fields [of others]. I have not
added to the weights of the scales. I have not depressed the pointer of the
balance. I have not carried away the milk from the mouths of children. I have
not driven the cattle away from their pastures. I have not snared the geese in
the goose-pens of the gods. I have not caught fish with bait made of the bodies
of the same kind of fish. I have not stopped water when it should flow. I have
not made a cutting in a canal of running water. I have not extinguished a fire
when it should burn. I have not violated the times [of offering] the chosen meat
offerings. I have not driven away the cattle on the estates of the gods. I have
not turned back the god at his appearances. I am pure. I am pure. I am pure. My
pure offerings are the pure offerings of that great Benu which dwelleth in
Hensu. For behold, I am the nose of Neb-nefu (the lord of the air), who giveth
sustenance unto all mankind, on the day of the filling of the Utchat in Anu, in
the second month of the season Pert, on the last of the month, [in the presence
of the Lord of this earth]. I have seen the filling of the Utchat in Anu,
therefore let not calamity befall me in this land, or in this Hall of Maati,
because I know the names of the gods who are therein, [and who are the followers
of the Great God].
