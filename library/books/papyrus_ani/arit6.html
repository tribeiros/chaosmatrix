<H3>THE SEVEN ARITS</H3><I>If [these] words be recited by the spirit when he
shall come to the Seven Arits, and as he entereth the doors, he shall neither be
turned back nor repulsed before Osiris, and he shall be made to have his being
among the blessed spirits, and to have dominion among the ancestral followers of
Osiris. If these things be done for any spirit he shall have his being in that
place like a lord of eternity in one body with Osiris, and at no place shall any
being contend against him.</I>
<H4>The Sixth Arit.</H4>The name of the Doorkeeper is Atek-tau-kehaq-kheru. The
name of the Watcher is An-her. The name of the Herald is Ates-her-[ari]-she.
<P>The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he cometh to
this Arit]: "I have come daily, I have come daily. I have made myself a way. I
have advanced over that which was created by Anpu (Anubis). I am the Lord of the
Urrt Crown. I am the possessor [of the knowledge of] the words of magical power,
I am the Avenger according to law, I have avenged [the injury to] his Eye. I
have defended Osiris. I have accomplished my journey. The Osiris Ani advanceth
with you with the word which is truth."
