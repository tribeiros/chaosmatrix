<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT DYING A SECOND TIME IN KHERT-NETER.</H4>The Osiris Ani
saith:- My hiding place is opened, my hiding place is opened. The Spirits fall
headlong in the darkness, but the Eye of Horus hath made me holy, and Upuati
hath nursed me. I will hide myself among you, O ye stars which are imperishable.
My brow is like the brow of Ra. My face is open. My heart-case is upon its
throne, I know how to utter words. In very truth I am Ra himself. I am not a man
of no account. I am not a man to whom violence can be done. Thy father liveth
for thee, O son of Nut. I am thy son, O great one, I have seen the hidden things
which are thine. I am crowned upon my throne like the king of the gods. I shall
not die a second time in Khert-Neter.
<P>
