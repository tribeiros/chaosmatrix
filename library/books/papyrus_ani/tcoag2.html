<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nebseni and the Papyrus of Nu)</I>
<P>Rise up thou, O Osiris, thou hast thy backbaone, O Still-heart, thou hast thy
neck vertebrae and thy back, O Still-heart! Place thou thyself on thy base. I
put water beneath thee, and I bring unto thee a Tet of god that thou mayest
rejoice therein.
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu): [This Chapter] shall be recited over a Tet of
gold set in a stand made of sycamore wood which hath been steeped in a tincture
of ankhamu flowers, and it shall be placed on the neck of the deceased on the
day of the funeral. If this amulet be placed on his neck he shall become a
perfect Khu in Khert-Neter, and at the festivals of the New Year he shall be
like unto the Followers of Osiris continually and for ever.</I>
<P><I>(From the Turin Papyrus): [This Chapter] shall be said over a Tet of gold
fashioned out of the trunk of a sycamore tree, and it shall be placed on the
neck of the deceased. Then shall he enter in through the doors of the Tuat. His
words whall be silenced. He shall place himself on the ground on New Year's Day
among the Followers of Osiris.</I>
<P><I>If this Chapter be known by the deceased he shall live like a perfect Khu
in Khert-Neter. He shall not be sent back from the doors of Amentet. There shall
be given to him the shens cake, and a cup of wine, and the persen cake, and
slices of meat on the altars of Ra, or as some read, Osiris Un-Nefer. And his
word shall be truth before his enemies in Khert-Neter continually, and for ever
and for ever.</I>
