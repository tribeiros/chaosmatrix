<H4>[THE CHAPTER OF] ENTERING INTO THE HALL OF MAATI TO PRAISE OSIRIS
KHENTI-AMENTI.</H4>The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I
have come unto thee. I have drawn nigh to behold thy beauties (thy beneficient
goodness). My hands are [extended] in adoration of thy name of Maat. I have
come. I have drawn nigh unto [the place where] the cedar-tree existeth not,
where the acacia tree doth not put forth shoots, and where the ground produceth
neither grass nor herbs. Now I have entered into the habitation which is hidden,
and I hold converse with Set. My protector advanced to me, covered was his
face.... on the hidden things. He entered into the house of Osiris, he saw the
hidden things which were therein. The Tchatchau Chiefs of the Pylons were in the
form of Spirits. The god Anpu spake unto those about him with the words of a man
who cometh from Ta-mera, saying, He knoweth our roads and our towns. I am
reconciled unto him. When I smell his odour it is even as the odour of one of
you. And I say unto him: I the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in peace, whose
word is truth, have come. I have drawn nigh to behold the Great Gods. I would
live upon the propitiatory offerings [made] to their Doubles. I would live on
the borders [of the territory of] the Soul, the Lord of Tetu. He shall make me
to come forth in the form of a Benu bird, and to hold converse [with him.] I
have been in the stream [to purify myself]. I have made offerings of incense. I
betook myself to the Acacia Tree of the [divine] Children. I lived in Abu in the
House of the goddess Satet. I made to sink in the water the boat of the enemies.
I sailed over the lake [in the temple] in the Neshmet Boat. I have looked upon
the Sahu of Kamur. I have been in Tetu. I have held my peace. I have made the
god to be master of his legs. I have been in the House of Teptuf. I have seen
him, that is the Governor of the Hall of the God. I have entered into the House
of Osiris and I have removed the head-coverings of him that is therein. I have
entered into Rasta, and I have seen the Hidden One who is therein. I was hidden,
but I found the boundary. I journeyed to Nerutef, and he who was therein covered
me with a garment. I have myrrh of women, together with the shenu powder of
living folk. Verily he (Osiris) told me the things which concerned himself. I
said: Let thy weighing of me be even as we desire.
<P>And the Majesty of Anpu shall say unto me, Knowest thou the name of this
door, and canst thou tell it? And the Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is
truth, in peace, whose word is truth, shall say, Khersek-Shu is the name of this
door. And the Majesty of the god Anpu shall say unto me, Knowest thou the name
of the upper leaf, and the name of the lower leaf? [And the Osiris the scribe
Ani] shall say: Neb-Maat-heri-retiu-f is the name of the upper leaf and
Neb-pehti-thesu-menment [is the name of the lower leaf. And the Majesty of the
god Anpu shall say], Pass on, for thou hast knowledge, O Osiris the scribe, the
assessor of the holy offerings of all the gods of Thebes Ani, whose word is
truth, the lord of loyal service [to Osiris].
<P>
