<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu): [This Chapter] shall be said over a Tet of
carnelian, which hath been washed in a tincture of ankhamu flowers, and is
fashioned out of the trunk of a sycamore tree. It shall be placed on the neck of
the deceased on the day of the funeral. If this be done for him the magical
powers of Isis will protect his members. Horus, the son of Isis, shall rejoice
when he seeth him. [No] road shall be blocked to him. His hand shall be to
heaven, his hand shall be to earth, for ever. Do not let anyone see him.
Verily....</I>
<P><I>(From the Saite Recension): [This Chapter] shall be said over a Tet of
carnelian, anointed with a tincture of ankhamu flowers, made from the trunk of a
sycamore tree. It shall be placed on the neck of the Khu. If this book be done
for him, the magical spells of Isis shall protect him, and Horus the son of Isis
shall rejoice [when] he seeth him. No road shall be blocked to him. His hand
shall be to heaven, his hand shall be to earth....... If this book be known by
him he shall be in the following of Osiris Un-Nefer, and his word shall be truth
in Khert-Neter. The doors in Khert-Neter shall be opened to him. Wheat and
barley shall be given to him in Sekhet-Aanru. His name shall be like [the names
of] the gods who are there, the Followers of Horus who reap.</I>
