<H4>THE CHAPTER OF ADVANCING TO THE TCHATCHAU CHIEFS OF OSIRIS.</H4>The Osiris
Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I have built a house for my Ba-soul in the
sanctuary in Tetu. I sow seed in the town of Pe (Buto). I have ploughed the
fields with my labourers. My palm tree [standeth upright and is] like Menu upon
it. I abominate abominable things. I will not eat the things which are
abominations unto me. What I abominate is filth: I will not eat it. I shall not
be destroyed by the offerings of propitiation and the sepulchral meals. I will
not approach filth [to touch it] with my hands, I will not tread upon it with my
sandals. For my bread shall be made of the white barley, and my ale shall be
made from the red grain of the god Hapi (the Nile-god), which the Sektet Boat
and the Atett Boat shall bring [unto me], and I will eat my food under the
leaves of the trees whose beautiful arms I myself do know. O what splendour
shall the White Crown make for me which shall be lifted up on me by the
Uraei-goddesses! O Doorkeeper of Sehetep-taui, bring thou to me that wherewith
the cakes of propitiation are made. Grant thou to me that I may lift up the
earth. May the Spirit-souls open to me [their] arms, and let the Company of the
Gods hold their peace whilst the Hememet spirits hold converse with the Osiris
Ani. May the hearts of the gods lead him in his exalted state into heaven among
the gods who appear in visible forms. If any god, or any goddess, attack the
Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, when he setteth out, the Ancestor of the year
who liveth upon hearts [Osiris] shall eat him when he cometh forth from Abydos,
and the Ancestors of Ra shall reckon with him, and the Ancestors of Light shall
reckon with him. [He is] a god of splendour [arrayed in] the apparel of heaven,
and he is among the Great Gods. Now the subsistence of the Osiris Ani, whose
word is truth, is among the cakes and the ale which are made for your mouths. I
enter in by the Disk, I come forth by the god Ahui. I shall hold converse with
the Followers of the Gods. I shall hold converse with the Disk. I shall hold
converse with the Hememet-spirits. He shall set the terror of me in the thick
darkness, in the inside of the goddess Mehurt, by the side of his forehead.
Behold, I shall be with Osiris, and my perfection shall be his perfection among
the Great Gods. I shall speak unto him with the words of men, I shall listen,
and he shall repeat to me the words of the gods. I, the Osiris Ani, whose word
is truth, in peace, have come equipped. Thou makest to approach [thee] those who
love thee. I am a Spirit-soul who is better equipped than any [other]
Spirit-soul.
