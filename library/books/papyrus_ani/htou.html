<H1>HYMN TO OSIRIS UN-NEFER</H1>A Hymn of Praise to Osiris Un-Nefer, the great
god who dwelleth in Abtu, the king of eternity, the lord of everlastingness, who
traverseth millions of years in his existence. Thou art the eldest son of the
womb of Nut. Thou was begotten by Keb, the Erpat. Thou art the lord of the Urrt
Crown. Thou art he whose White Crown is lofty. Thou art the King (Ati) of gods
[and] men. Thou hast gained possession of the sceptre of rule, and the whip, and
the rank and dignity of thy divine fathers. Thy heart is expanded with joy, O
thou who art in the kingdom of the dead. Thy son Horus is firmly placed on thy
throne. Thou hast ascended thy throne as the Lord of Tetu, and as the Heq who
dwelleth in Abydos. Thou makest the Two Lands to flourish through
Truth-speaking, in the presence of him who is the Lord to the Uttermost Limit.
Thou drawest on that which hath not yet come into being in thy name of
"Ta-her-sta-nef." Thou governest the Two Lands by Maat in thy name of "Seker."
Thy power is wide-spread, thou art he of whom the fear is great in thy name of
"Usar" (or "Asar"). Thy existence endureth for an infinite number of double
henti periods in thy name of "Un-Nefer."
<P>Homage to thee, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and Prince of Princes. Thou
hast ruled the Two Lands from the womb of the goddess Nut. Thou hast governed
the Lands of Akert. Thy members are of silver-gold, thy head is of lapis-lazuli,
and the crown of thy head is of turquoise. Thou art An of millions of years. Thy
body is all pervading, O Beautiful Face in Ta-tchesert. Grant thou to me glory
in heaven, and power upon earth, and truth-speaking in the Divine Underworld,
and [the power to] sail down the river to Tetu in the form of a living Ba-soul,
and [the power to] sail up the river to Abydos in the form of a Benu bird, and
[the power to] pass in through and to pass out from, without obstruction, the
doors of the lords of the Tuat. Let there be given unto me bread-cakes in the
House of Refreshing, and sepulchral offerings of cakes and ale, and propitiatory
offerings in Anu, and a permanent homestead in Sekhet-Aaru, with wheat and
barley therein- to the Double of the Osiris, the scribe Ani.
<P>
