<H2>TEXTS RELATING TO THE WEIGHING OF THE HEART OF ANI</H2>
<H4>THE PRAYER OF ANI:-</H4>My heart, my mother; my heart, my mother! My heart
whereby I came into being! May nought stand up to oppose me at [my] judgment,
may there be no opposition to me in the presence of the Chiefs (Tchatchau); may
there be no parting of thee from me in the presence of him that keepeth the
Balance! Thou art my KA, which dwelleth in my body; the god Khnemu who knitteth
together and strengtheneth my limbs. Mayest thou come forth into the place of
happiness whither we go. May the Sheniu officials, who make the conditions of
the lives of men, not cause my name to stink, and may no lies be spoken against
me in the presence of the God. [Let it be satisfactory unto us, and let the
Listener god be favourable unto us, and let there be joy of heart (to us) at the
weighing of words. Let not that which is false be uttered against me before the
Great God, the Lord of Amentet. Verily, how great shalt thou be when thou risest
in triumph.]
<P>
