<BODY>
<H4>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEAD OF A MAN BE CUT OFF FROM HIS BODY IN
KHERT-NETER.</H4>The Osiris Ani saith:- I am a Great One, the son of a Great
One. [I am] Fire, the son of Fire, to whom was given his head after it had been
cut off. The head of Osiris was not removed from his body, and the head of
Osiris Ani shall not be removed from his body. I have knitted myself together, I
have made myself whole and complete. I shall renew my youth. I am Osiris
Himself, the Lord of Eternity.
