<H1>The Solar Litany</H1>Homage to you, O ye gods of the Dekans in Anu, and to
you, O ye Hememet-spirits in Kher Aha, and to thee, O Unti, who art the most
glorious of all the gods who are hidden in Anu, O grant thou unto me a path
whereover I may pass in peace, for I am just and true; I have not spoken
falsehood wittingly, nor have I done aught with deceit.
<P>Homage to thee, O An in Antes, Heru-khuti, who dost with long strides march
across the heavens, O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace,
for I am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I done
aught with deceit.
<P>Homage to thee, O Everlasting Soul, thou Soul who dwellest in Tetu, Un-Nefer,
the son of Nut, who art the Lord of Akert, O grant thou unto me a path whereover
I may pass in peace, for I am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood
wittingly, nor have done aught with deceit.
<P>Homage to thee in thy dominion over Tetu, upon whose brow the Urrt Crown is
established, thou One who createst the strength to protect thyself, and who
dwellest in peace, O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace,
for I am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I done
aught with deceit.
<P>Homage to thee, O Lord of the Acacia Tree, whose Seker Boat is set upon its
sledge, who turnest back the Fiend, the Evildoer, and dost cause the Eye of Ra
(utchat) to rest upon its seat, O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass
in peace, for I am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor
have I done aught with deceit.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who art mighty in thine hour, thou great and mighty
Prince who dost dwell in Anrutef, thou Lord of Eternity and Creator of the
Everlastingness, thou Lord of Hensu, O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may
pass in peace, for I am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly,
nor have I done aught with deceit.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who restest upon Truth, thou Lord of Abtu, whose limbs
form the substance of Ta-tchesert, unto whom fraud and deceit are abominations,
O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace, for I am just and
true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I done aught with deceit.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou who dwellest in thy boat, who dost bring Hapi (the
Nile) forth from his cavern, whose body is the light, and who dwellest in
Nekhen, O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace, for I am just
and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I done aught with
deceit.
<P>Homage to thee, O thou Creator of the gods, thou King of the South and North,
Osiris, whose word is truth, who rulest the world by thy gracious goodness, thou
Lord of the Atebui, O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace,
for I am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I done
aught with deceit.
