<BODY>APPENDIX
<P><I>(From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 21)</I>
<P>
<H4>THE CHAPTER OF COMING FORTH AGAINST ENEMIES IN KHERT-NETER.</H4>The Osiris
Nu saith:- Hail, Am-a-f (Eater of his arm), I have passed over the road. I am
Ra. I have come forth from the horizon against my enemies. I have not permitted
him to escape from me. I have stretched out my hand like that of the Lord of the
Urrt Crown. I have lifted up my feet even as the Uraei-goddesses lift themselves
up. I have not permitted the enemy [to be saved] from me. As for mine enemy, he
hath been given to me, and he shall not be delivered from me. I stand up like
Horus. I sit down like Ptah. I am strong like Thoth. I am mighty like Tem. I
walk with my legs. I speak with my mouth. I chase my enemy. He hath been given
unto me, and he shall not be delivered from me.
