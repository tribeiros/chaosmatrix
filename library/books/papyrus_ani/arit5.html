<H3>THE SEVEN ARITS</H3><I>If [these] words be recited by the spirit when he
shall come to the Seven Arits, and as he entereth the doors, he shall neither be
turned back nor repulsed before Osiris, and he shall be made to have his being
among the blessed spirits, and to have dominion among the ancestral followers of
Osiris. If these things be done for any spirit he shall have his being in that
place like a lord of eternity in one body with Osiris, and at no place shall any
being contend against him.</I>
<H4>The Fifth Arit.</H4>The name of the Doorkeeper is Ankhf-em-fent. The name of
the Watcher is Shabu. The name of the Herald is Teb-her-kha-kheft.
<P>The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he cometh to
this Arit]: "I have brought unto thee the jawbone in Ra-stau. I have brought
unto thee thy backbone in Anu. I have gathered together his manifold members
therein. I have driven back Aapep for thee. I have spit upon the wounds [in his
body]. I have made myself a path among you. I am the Aged One among the gods. I
have made offerings to Osiris. I have defended him with the word of truth. I
have gathered together his bones, and have collected all his members."
<P>
