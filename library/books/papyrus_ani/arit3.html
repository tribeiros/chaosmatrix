<H3>THE SEVEN ARITS</H3><I>If [these] words be recited by the spirit when he
shall come to the Seven Arits, and as he entereth the doors, he shall neither be
turned back nor repulsed before Osiris, and he shall be made to have his being
among the blessed spirits, and to have dominion among the ancestral followers of
Osiris. If these things be done for any spirit he shall have his being in that
place like a lord of eternity in one body with Osiris, and at no place shall any
being contend against him.</I>
<H4>The Third Arit.</H4>The name of the Doorkeeper is Unem-hauatu-ent-pehui. The
name of the Watcher is Seres-her. The name of the Herald is Aa.
<P>The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he cometh to
this Arit]: "I am he who is hidden in the great deep. I am the Judge of the
Rehui, I have come and I have done away the offensive thing which was upon
Osiris. I tie firmly the place on which he standeth, coming forth from the Urt.
I have stablished things in Abtu, I have opened up a way through Ra-stau, and I
have relieved the pain which was in Osiris. I have balanced the place whereon he
standeth, and I have made a path for him; he shineth brilliantly in Ra-stau."
