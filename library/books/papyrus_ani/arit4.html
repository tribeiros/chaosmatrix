<H3>THE SEVEN ARITS</H3><I>If [these] words be recited by the spirit when he
shall come to the Seven Arits, and as he entereth the doors, he shall neither be
turned back nor repulsed before Osiris, and he shall be made to have his being
among the blessed spirits, and to have dominion among the ancestral followers of
Osiris. If these things be done for any spirit he shall have his being in that
place like a lord of eternity in one body with Osiris, and at no place shall any
being contend against him.</I>
<H4>The Fourth Arit.</H4>The name of the Doorkeeper is Khesef-her-asht-kheru.
The name of the Watcher is Seres-tepu. The name of the Herald is Khesef-at.
<P>The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he cometh to
this Arit]: "I am the Bull, the son of the ancestress of Osiris. O grant ye that
his father, the Lord of his god-like companions, may bear witness on his behalf.
I have weighed the guilty in judgment. I have brought unto his nostrils the life
which is ever lasting. I am the son of Osiris, I have accomplished the journey,
I have advanced in Khert-Neter."
<P>
