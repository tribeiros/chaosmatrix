<H1>The Priests Anmutef and Sameref</H1>
<H4>THE SPEECH OF THE PRIEST ANMUTEF.</H4>I have come unto you, O ye great
Tchatcha Chiefs who dwell in heaven, and upon earth, and in Khert-Neter, and I
have brought unto you the Osiris Ani. He hath not committed any act which is an
abomination before all the gods. Grant ye that he may live with you every day.
<P>The Osiris the scribe Ani adoreth Osiris, Lord of Rasta, and the Great
Company of the Gods who live in Khert-Neter. He saith: "Homage to thee, Khenti
Amenti, Un-Nefer, who dwellest in Abtu. I come to thee. My heart holdeth Truth.
There is no sin in my body. I have not told a lie wittingly, I have not acted in
a double manner. Grant thou to me cakes, let me appear in the presence, at the
altar of the Lords of Truth, let me go in and come forth from Khert-Neter [at
will], let not my Heart-soul be driven away [from me]; and grant me a sight of
the Disk and the beholding of the Moon for ever and ever.
<P>
