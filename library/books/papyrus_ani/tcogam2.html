<H4>THE CHAPTER OF COMING FORTH BY DAY AND OF OPENING UP A WAY THROUGH THE
AMEHET:</H4>Behold, the scribe Nebseni, whose word is truth, saith:- Homage to
you, O ye Lords of Kau, ye who are without sin, and who live for the endless and
infinite aeons of time which make up eternity. I have opened up a way for myself
to you. I have become a spirit in my forms, I have gotten the mastery over my
words of magical power, and I am adjudged a spirit; therefore deliver ye me from
the Crocodile [which liveth in] this Country of Truth. Grant ye to me my mouth
that I may speak therewith, and cause ye that sepulchral offerings shall be made
unto me in your presence, for I know you, and I know your names, and I know also
the name of the mighty god before whose face ye set your celestial food. His
name is "Tekem." [When] he openeth up his path on the eastern horizon of heaven,
[when] he alighteth towards the western horizon of heaven, may he carry me along
with him, and may I be safe and sound. Let not the Mesqet make an end of me, let
not the Fiend (Sebau) gain the mastery over me, let me not be driven away from
the doors of the Other World, let not you doors be shut in my face, for my cakes
are in the city of Pe, and my ale is in the city of Tep. And there, in the
celestial mansions of heaven which my divine father Tem hath stablished, let my
hands lay hold upon the wheat and the barley, which shall be given unto me
therein in abundant measure, and may the son of my own body make ready for me my
food therein. And grant ye unto me when I am there sepulchral meals, and
incense, and unguents, and all the pure and beautiful things whereon the god
liveth, in every deed for ever, in all the transformations which it pleaseth me
[to perform], and grant unto me the power to float down and to sail up the
stream in the Field of Reeds (Sekhet-Aaru), [and may I reach Sekhet-hetepet (the
Field of Offerings)]. I am the twin Lion-gods (Shu and Tefnut).
