Whenever two opposed forces act upon a thing (unless that thing happens to
be at the place where the forces are exactly balanced), the thing will
oscillate between the extremes (as does a pendulum or weight on a spring).
Such cycles between opposites are everywhere in the world, from the wheel
of the year to the alchemical rotation of elements to processes of growth
and decline.  Chapter I explains the eight phases of any such cycle,
including its shifting balances of state and energy.  This eightfold
structure is based on mathematical principles, though the presentation
here is nonmathematical.  Chapter 2 relates these eight phases of cyclic
change to the trigrams of the I Ching in the sequence of the Earlier
Heaven.  As Heraclitus said, <P>

Opposition is fitting, and from differences comes the most<BR>
beautiful harmony, and all things come to be through strife.

<P>
                        Concerning the Eight Exchanges
</H2>

i.  We consider cyclic processes, which unite dualities by bringing each
extreme to its polar opposite.<P>

ij.  We call the opposites High and Low, though they may be any
distinguished pair:  Firm-Yielding, Light-Dark, Active-Passive,
Male-Female, etc.<P>

iij.  The extremes mark two distinguished points in the cycle, which we
call H and L (for High and Low).<P>

iv.  There are two paths in the cycle, the Ascending path from Low to
High, and the Descending path from High to Low.<P>

v.  We consider here only non-retrograde motions, i.e., once started in a
direction, they go to the extreme in that direction before reversing.
There is no Ascending in the Descending path, and no Descending in the
Ascending path. (The motions are pure.)<P>

vi.  There is a point of Equilibrium between the High and the Low; we call
it B = Balance (or E = Equilibrium).<P>

vij.  In each path there is a place of equilibrium where the balance
shifts.<P>

viij.  The Ascending Equilibrium, called A, is where the balance shifts
from Low to High.<P>

ix.  The Descending Equilibrium, called D, is where the balance shifts
from High to Low.<P>

x.  High, Low and the Ascending and Descending equilibria mark four
distinguished points in the cycle (L, A, H, D).<P>

<center>
<img src="lom-1.gif" alt="">
</center><P>

xi.  In passing from Ascent to Descent, the process must pause, at least
momentarily, at the High point, and in passing from Descent to Ascent, the
process must pause, at least momentarily, at the Low point.<P>

xij.  The extremes are thus states, or points of stasis, between the
opposed processes.<P>

xiij.  So also the Ascending and Descending points are pure process in
equilibrium between the two extremes.<P>

xiv.  The extremes H and L are pure state; the equilibria A and D are pure
process.  These four points correspond to pure being and pure becoming,
respectively; all other points in the cycle are mixtures of state and
process (being and becoming).<P>

xv.  The possible mixtures are AL = Ascending from Low, AH = Ascending to
High, DH = Descending from High, DL = Descending to Low.<P>

<center>
<img src="lom-2.gif" alt="">
</center><P>

xvi.  Each cycle has at least one natural notion of "energy" (though it
may be hidden and hard to discover), which is conserved (neither created
nor destroyed).<P>

xvij.  This energy is of two kinds:  energy of state (location) and energy
of process (motion), which are converted into each other.  (Energy is the
medium of exchange between being and becoming.)<P>

xviij.  Energy of state has its origin in the tension inherent in the
polarity between the extremes.  (In physical systems, this is potential
energy.)<P>

xx.  Energy of process measures the vehemence of the transformation
between the extremes.  (In physical systems, this is kinetic energy.)<P>

xxi.  Since there is no motion at the extremes, there is no process energy
at H and L, and all the energy is invested in the state.<P>

xxij.  At the equilibrium points the extremes are in balance, so there is
no energy of state at A and D.  Therefore, all the system's energy is in
the process, and thus the process energy is at its greatest at the
equilibria.<P>

xxiij.  Since all the energy is in the state at the extremes and in the
process at the equilibria, in each quarter of the cycle there must be at
least one point where the process and state energies are in balance.<P>

<center>
<img src="lom-3.gif" alt="">
</center><P>

xxiv.  We shall restrict our attention to processes that are
non-retrograde in this transfer of energy, so that there is only one such
balance point in each quadrant.<P>

xxv.  There are thus four points where the state and process energy are
balanced, which are called L=A, A=H, H=D and D=L.<P>

xxvi.  Thus there are eight distinguished points in the cycle:  L, L=A, A,
A=H, H, H=D, D, D=L.<P>

<center>
<img src="lom-4.gif" alt="">
</center><P>

xxvij.  These eight points define eight segments in the cyclic path, which
are eight phases in any cycle.<P>

xxviij.  The octants adjacent to the extremes are dominated by state and
are comparatively static.<P>

xxix.  The octants adjacent to the equilibria are dominated by process and
are relatively dynamic.<P>

xxx.  The octants are named by their dominant character (Low, Ascending,
High, Descending) and their subdominant character.  In the cycle from Low
to High and back, they are LA, AL, AH, HA, HD, DH, DL, LD.<P>

<center>
<img src="lom-5.gif" alt="">
</center><P>

xxxi.  The High state dominates HA and HD; the Low state dominates LA and
LD. <P>

xxxij.  The Ascending process dominates AH and AL; the Descending process
dominates DH and DL. <P>

xxxiij.  Nevertheless, all the octants of the cycle comprise both state
and process (being and becoming), though the quality and quantity of each
varies. <P>

i.  In the High quadrant, comprising octants HA and HD, the High state is
dominant.  This corresponds to pure yang, represented by a digram with two
firm lines:  || [drawn from left to right rather than from bottom to top].
This part of the cycle is called Complete (or Culminating or Climaxing)
Yang. <P>

ij.  In the Low quadrant, comprising octants LA and LD, the Low state
dominates. This corresponds to pure yin, represented by the digram with
two yielding lines: ::.  This is called Complete (or Culminating or
Climaxing) Yin. <P>

iij.  In the Ascending quadrant, comprising the octants AL and AH, the
Ascending process dominates.  It is yang because ascending, but has an
admixture of the yin, which gives it motion, so it is represented by the
digram |:, which is called Incipient Yang (or Lesser Yin). <P>

iv.  In the Descending quadrant, comprising the octants DL and DH, the
Descending process dominates.  It is yin because descending, but has an
admixture of yang, which gives it tension, and therefore motion, so it is
represented by the digram :|, which is Incipient Yin (or Lesser Yang). <P>

<center>
<img src="lom-6.gif" alt="">
</center><P>

v.  In octant AL the Ascending process (|:) dominates, but is tempered by,
the Low state (::), so the Incipient Yang digram (|:) is modified by the
upper line of the Complete Yin digram (::), to yield the trigram |::,
called "Thunder." <P>

vi.  In octant AH, Ascending (|:) is tempered by the High State (||); thus
|: is modified by the upper line of :: to yield |::, "Fire." <P>

vij.  In octant HA, High (||) is tempered by Ascending (|:) to yield ||:,
"Lake." <P>

viij.  In octant HD, High (||) is tempered by Descending (:|) to yield
|||, "Heaven." <P>

ix.  In octant DH, Descending (:|) is tempered by High (||) to yield :||,
"Wind." <P>

x.  In octant DL, Descending (:|) is tempered by Low (::) to yield :|:,
"Water." <P>

xi.  In octant LD, Low (::) is tempered by Descending (:|) to yield ::|,
"Mountain." <P>

xij.  In octant LA, Low (::) is tempered by Ascending (|:) to yield :::,
"Earth." <P>

xiij.  This is the sequence of trigrams attributed to Fu Hsi, and called
the sequence of the Earlier Heaven or the Primal Order (literally, the
Before-the-World Sequence). <P>

<center>

</center><P>

xiv.  The path of Ascent comprises the octants LA, AL, AH, HA, which
correspond to the forward-moving trigrams :::, |::, |:|, ||:.  The path of
Descent comprises the octants HD, DH, DL, LD, which correspond to the
backward-moving trigrams |||, :||, :|:, ::|.  [TC I.A.2, 4] <P>

xv.  Octant LA is dominated by the Low state, but incorporates the
beginning of the Ascending Process; it is the Low (::) beginning to Ascend
(|:), so its trigram is :::, called "The Receptive" (K'un), with its image
Earth.  It is yielding and the nourishing, sheltering womb of rebirth [SK
II.4-5, III.10]. This is the Mother, who seeks the male and gives birth to
the Ascending Path, which seeks Heaven (|||).  Its direction is North. <P>

xvi.  In octant AL the Ascending Process comes into dominance and the
state is moved swiftly toward Equilibrium.  It is the process of Ascending
(|:) from the Low state (::), so its trigram is |::, called "The Arousing"
(Chen), with its image Thunder.  Its character is to incite movement; it
awakens the seeds; it is decisive and vehement.  It is the creative force
stirring in Nature's womb.  The Mother brings forth the Eldest Son.  Its
direction is Northeast.  [SK II.4-5, III.10, 11; TC I.A.3] <P>

xvij.  In octant AH the Ascending Process passes through Equilibrium and
moves rapidly toward the High State.  It is the Ascending Process (|:)
striving to the High State (||), so its trigram is |:|, called "The
Clinging" (Li), with the image Fire.  It is the Lightning presaged by the
rumbling Thunder, and it brings warmth and light (attributes of the High
state).  It is the trigram of the Sun; its season is Spring and its
direction is East.  It is the time of rapid growth. Fire is the Middle Son
sought by the Mother.  [SK II.4-5, III.10-11] <P>

xviij.  In octant HA the Ascent slows as it approaches its culmination in
the High State.  Here the High State (||) achieved by the final Ascent
(|:), so its trigram is ||:, called "The Joyous" (Tui), with the image
Lake.  This is the phase of joy and pleasure, for as the High State is
reached, relaxation can begin and the fruits if the Ascent can be enjoyed.
Its direction is Southeast. Lake is the Youngest Son brought forth by the
Mother.  [SK II.4-5] <P>

xix.  In octant HD the the cycle, having reached its extreme in the High
State (||), slowly begins its Descent (:|), so its trigram is |||, called
"The Creative" (Ch'ien), with the image Heaven.  It is strong, governing
and creative.  Its season is Summer and it stands in the South, for in
both the Sun is strongest.  This trigram is the Father, who seeks the
female, and sires the Descending Path, which seeks the Earth (:::).  This
path corresponds to the four elements in order of increasing density:
Fire (Heaven), Air (Wind), Water and Earth.  Of necessity, the seeds of
the Descent are hidden in the High State, as the Ascent was hidden in the
womb of the Low State.  [SK II.4-5, III.10; TC I.A.3] <P>

xx.  In octant DH the Descent from the High state accelerates as it
returns to Equilibrium.  Since it is a Descent (:|) from the High State
(||), its trigram is :||, called "The Gentle" (Sun), with the images Wind
and Wood.  The character of the Wind is penetration and dispersion, so it
is the active process that brings the rapid dissolution of the High State.
Like the Thunder (|::), which awakens in the Earth (:::), the Wind (:||)
dissolves the icy rigidity of Heaven (|||); it is the creative force
stirring in the Heavens.  In seeking the female the Father sires the
Eldest Daughter.  Its direction is Southwest.  [SK II.4, III.10-11; TC
I.A.3-4] <P>

xxi.  In octant DL the Descent passes through Equilibrium and approaches
the Low State.  Since it is a Descent (:|) to the Low State (::), its
trigram is :|:, called "The Abysmal" (K'an), with the image Water.  This
water moves rapidly, sometimes flowing straight, other times turning, ever
seeking to descend to the depths.  The Wind (:||) descends to become Rain
(:|:), which then descends to the Mountain (::|), and soaks into the Earth
(:::) to engender new birth.  As a rapid plunge into the depths, this
phase is dangerous, but it provides necessary moisture (fluidity).  Water
(:|:) corresponds to the Moon, as Fire (|:|) does to the Sun.  Water is
the Middle Daughter Sought by the Father.  Its direction is West, where
the heavenly lights sink into the water.  [SK ii.4-5, III.10-11; TC
I.A.3-4] <P>

xxij.  In octant LD the Descent slows as it nears the Low State.  Here the
Low State (::) is achieved by the Descent (:|), so its trigram is ::|,
called "Keeping Still" (Ken), with the Mountain its image.  Here the
process stops, and the movement rests before starting a new Ascent (and so
it balances the Joyous Lake, ||:).  All things are brought to perfection
by Keeping Still; here the seed is planted for a new beginning.  It is the
Gatekeeper to the Earth, where rebirth takes place.  [SK II.4-5,
III.10-11; TC I.A.3-4] <P>

xxiij.  And so we return to octant LA; the depths of the Low State (::)
hold the seeds for a new process of Ascent (|:), which occurs in the Earth
(:::), the receptive Mother, who is in the North. <P>
